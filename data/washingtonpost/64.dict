The justices allowed a constrained version of the order to take effect for the time being \u2014 but only on foreigners \u201cwho lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d The effect of that ruling is likely to fall most heavily on refugees from some of the world\u2019s most desperate places, while continuing to allow a flow of visitors from the six countries singled out by the Trump administration \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 albeit in diminished numbers.\n\nThe court\u2019s attempt to craft a temporary way forward that would limit the harm to individuals is welcome and should prevent hardship for thousands of students, relatives of U.S. citizens and others. Nonetheless, the three conservative justices who dissented, arguing that the full ban should go into effect now, may be right in predicting that the court opened the door to a muddled new season of immigration litigation. As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the dissenters, lawsuits are now likely to flourish as the government and affected individuals and institutions struggle over what constitutes \u201ca bona fide relationship\u201d and who may stake a credible claim to one.\n\nAll immigration policy involves splitting the baby \u2014 admitting some who want to enter the United States while excluding many \u2014 in one form or another; the high court is likely to delimit the terms of that exercise later this year. Still, it\u2019s notable that the administration, which has argued so passionately that a travel ban is urgently required on the basis of national security, never asked the court to adjudicate the ban\u2019s lawfulness on an expedited basis. That alone gives the lie to the supposed urgency that Mr. Trump has said compelled his executive order in the first place.\n\nThe court also served notice that the administration\u2019s foot-dragging on crafting new screening and vetting procedures for immigrants from the affected countries \u2014 the very rationale it used in arguing for a ban from the outset \u2014 will now come under heightened scrutiny. Officials have contended that rulings by lower courts blocking implementation of the ban also stopped the administration from developing those more muscular procedures, a process that was supposed to take 90 days for the six mostly Muslim countries and 120 days for refugees.\n\nThat argument was always suspect. Now, with more than 150 days having elapsed since the president\u2019s first ban was announced in January, and more than 100 days since the revised one was issued in March, it\u2019s even fishier. If there\u2019s such urgency, why haven\u2019t improved procedures been developed, which would render the ban itself moot by now? The justices themselves asked the administration and groups challenging the ban to address that question, which will be an even more glaring point of contention when the case is heard by the court this fall.\n\nPredictably, Mr. Trump hailed the court\u2019s interim decision as a famous victory; it isn\u2019t. A key component of the ban, affecting thousands of potential visitors with ties to this country, remains blocked. And until the court issues a final ruling, later this year or next, the very constitutionality of the administration\u2019s action remains in doubt.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "type": "article"}
