Frosh (D) said Friday that Maryland plans to join Washington in its lawsuit against President Trump\u2019s travel ban, the first legal action by Frosh since the General Assembly gave him authority to sue the federal government.\n\nFrosh called the ban \u201cunwise, illegal and un-American\u201d and said it makes the country \u201cless safe, not more safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s second executive order is still a Muslim ban,\u201d Frosh said in a statement. \u201cIt makes us less competitive and sends a message to the most talented academics, scientists and engineers around the world that they are not welcome. It will harm Maryland\u2019s universities and our economy.\u201d\n\nThe decision by Frosh comes less than a month after the Maryland General Assembly empowered him to sue the federal government without first having to get permission from the governor.\n\nThe General Assembly approved the resolution after the attorney general sent a Feb. 1 letter to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) asking for permission to take legal action against Trump\u2019s controversial entry ban but never received an answer.\n\nRaquel M. Coombs, a spokeswoman for Frosh, said Maryland is one of at least five states that will formally join Washington in the lawsuit. The lawsuit is expected to be amended on Monday.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-10", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/ovetta.wiggins", "type": "article"}
