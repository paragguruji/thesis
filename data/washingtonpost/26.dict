But their ruling is undeniably a blow to the government and means the travel ban will remain off for the foreseeable future.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nTrump reacted angrily on Twitter, posting just minutes after the ruling, \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d He later said to reporters that the judges had made \u201ca political decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where the security of our country is at stake, and it\u2019s a very, very serious situation, so we look forward, as I just said, to seeing them in court,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump continued to take aim at the ruling. He posted on Twitter a quote from a Lawfare article, which noted the judges had not cited in their opinion the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president broad powers to stop foreigners from entering the United States.\n\nWhat Trump failed to note is the article\u2019s author said he felt the court\u2019s decision was \u201ccorrect \u2026 for the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks.\u201d The judges, too, noted they \u201cowe considerable deference to the President\u2019s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security,\u201d and their decision \u2014 for now \u2014 was limited to whether the government had an immediate need to put the ban back in place.\n\nThe Justice Department, the Lawfare piece added, had \u201csubmitted no evidence to rebut the States\u2019 argument that the district court\u2019s order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years,\u201d adding that the government \u201cmay yet pursue and vindicate its interests in the full course of this litigation.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department, which was defending the administration\u2019s position, said in a statement it was \u201creviewing the decision and considering its options.\u201d\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had sued over the ban, said, \u201cBottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington,\u201d and declared that the judges\u2019 ruling \u201ceffectively granted everything we sought.\u201d\n\n[Read the 9th Circuit\u2019s opinion on the travel ban]\n\nThe Justice Department could now ask the Supreme Court \u2014 which often defers to the president on matters of immigration and national security \u2014 to intervene. The Supreme Court, though, remains one justice short, and many see it as ideologically split 4 to 4. A tie would keep in place whatever the appeals court decides. The Justice Department could also ask the full 9th Circuit to consider the matter.\n\nThe appeals court opinion was written by Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama; Judge Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge William C. Canby, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. It was detailed, but it does not represent a final judgment on Trump\u2019s immigration ban.\n\nLast Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart granted the states of Washington and Minnesota a temporary restraining order on the ban. The appeals court judges noted their ruling was a \u201cpreliminary one,\u201d and they were deciding only whether the government had \u201cmade a strong showing of its likely success\u201d in getting the restraining order thrown out.\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said on Fox News: \u201cThis ruling does not affect the merits at all. It is an interim ruling, and we\u2019re fully confident now that we\u2019ll get our day in court and have an opportunity to argue this on the merits, that we\u2019ll prevail.\u201d\n\nThe ruling, though, is critically important \u2014 as Trump\u2019s ban on refugees lasts only 120 days, and his ban on visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen lasts only 90 days. The judges also said that while the states of Washington and Minnesota had made serious allegations \u2014 and the impact of the order was \u201cimmediate and widespread\u201d \u2014 the government had not pointed to any substantive evidence to support its need for the ban.\n\n\u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cRather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.\u201d\n\n[Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says]\n\nThe states have alleged that the executive order harms their businesses and universities, preventing some students and faculty from traveling abroad for fear of being stranded and diminishing the sales tax revenue they receive.\n\nLegislators and others who had opposed the ban hailed the judges\u2019 ruling and urged Trump to back down.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cHe should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said, \u201cIf the President were serious about bringing our country together and keeping us safe, he would rescind this arbitrary and discriminatory order and recall what makes our country great.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, who lost the presidency to Trump in November, posted on Twitter simply, \u201c3-0.\u201d\n\nFederal immigration law undeniably gives the president broad authority to bar people from coming into the United States, stating that if the president finds \u201cthe entry of any aliens\u201d would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the country\u2019s interests, he can impose restrictions. But lawsuits across the country have alleged that Trump\u2019s particular order ran afoul of the Constitution in that it intentionally discriminated against Muslims.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday, Justice Department lawyer August Flentje vigorously disputed that the measure was intended to target Muslims. In their ruling, the judges did not reveal their opinion on that question, although they noted Washington and Minnesota had \u201coffered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.\u201d\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani recently said publicly: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said: \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d On the campaign trail, Trump himself called for a \u201ccomplete and total shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the country.\n\nThe appeals court judges had questioned both sides skeptically at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, seeming particularly interested in what evidence Trump relied upon in implementing his order and what limits the Justice Department saw on the president\u2019s authority to set immigration policy. While Flentje urged them to restore the measure completely, he also at one point offered a fallback position. The judges, he suggested, could limit Robart\u2019s order so that it applied only to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future.\n\n[Trump decries \u2018disgraceful\u2019 opposition as appeals court weighs immigration order]\n\nThey declined to do even that, saying, as written, the president\u2019s executive order could apply even to green-card holders \u2014 which it once seemed to do, although the White House counsel later issued guidance saying it did not. The judges said the Justice Department had \u201coffered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order,\u201d and \u201cin light of the Government\u2019s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order,\u201d they were not convinced that guidance would hold.\n\nTrump and his supporters have pressed the case that the short-term stoppage on refugees and immigrants from the seven countries is necessary for national security reasons, and they have leveled blunt criticism at the courts. Trump went so far as to suggest on Twitter that if an attack were to happen, the judiciary would be to blame. On Wednesday, he denounced arguments about his order as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said \u201ca bad high school student\u201d would understand the broad authority the law gives him to impose immigration restrictions.\n\nA day earlier, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Congress that he thought judges might be considering the issue from an \u201cacademic\u201d perspective instead of the national security lens through which he views the world.\n\n[Trump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked entry ban]\n\n\u201cOf course, in their courtrooms, they\u2019re protected by people like me,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nFederal courts in New York, California and elsewhere already had blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts declared that he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. The case before the 9th Circuit, though, was much broader than the others, because it stemmed from a federal judge\u2019s outright halting of the ban.\n\nAbby Phillip and John Wagner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nDenied Entry: Stories of refugees and immigrants barred from the U.S.\n\n\u2018Donald Trump destroyed my life,\u2019 says barred Iraqi who worked for U.S.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
