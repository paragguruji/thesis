We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand-new order.\u201d\n\nHe said among the revisions he might make are \u201cnew security measures.\u201d\n\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously Thursday that Trump\u2019s travel ban should remain suspended, allowing people previously barred to continue entering the United States. While the judges were deciding only whether national security concerns necessitated immediately reinstating the ban \u2014 and not whether it could ultimately pass constitutional muster \u2014 their ruling put the future of Trump\u2019s order in doubt.\n\nWhite House and Justice Department officials began mulling several options as new Attorney General Jeff Sessions was briefed on the matter. They could rewrite the order in hopes that modifications would help it pass legal muster. They could ask the Supreme Court or the full 9th Circuit to intervene immediately. Or they could wage a battle in the lower courts, hoping that judges considering more squarely whether the issue ran afoul of the Constitution would land on Trump\u2019s side.\n\nOn Friday, the White House injected an element of confusion when an official told reporters that the administration would not seek Supreme Court intervention, only to take it back and be contradicted by Priebus minutes later. Meanwhile, a 9th Circuit judge, without prompting, called for a vote to determine whether the entire court should rehear the case. The court asked for briefs from those involved in the case by Thursday.\n\n[Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban]\n\nNo matter what it chooses to do, the White House will face a difficult battle to restore the ban, particularly in the short term. The 9th Circuit judges indicated that some of the administration\u2019s proposed concessions \u2014 which presumably could turn into rewrites \u2014 don\u2019t go far enough. Government lawyers also cannot undo Trump\u2019s campaign trail comments about wanting to stop all Muslims from entering the country and his assertion after taking office that Christians would be given priority. That is potentially compelling evidence that even a watered-down order might be intended to discriminate, said Leon Fresco, who worked in the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThe problem is this is such a bad case for the government to be making these arguments,\u201d Fresco said.\n\nIf judges fear that the government will revert to its original position once litigation has stopped, \u201cthe court won\u2019t usually dismiss those matters, because they say, \u2018Look, it\u2019s likely to come up again,\u2019 \u201d Fresco said.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended View Photos After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.

The order ostensibly enacted a temporary pause on people entering the country so that the administration could develop more stringent vetting procedures. Trump referenced \u201cextreme vetting\u201d when asked what a modified order might entail.\n\n\u201cWe have very, very strong vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI call it extreme vetting, and we\u2019re going very strong on security.\u201d\n\n[7 key takeaways from the court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s immigration order]\n\nIn a separate case in federal court in Virginia, a judge Friday pressed the government to produce any evidence that a ban on travel was necessary on national security grounds. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said the presidential order \u201chas all kinds of defects\u201d and \u201cclearly is overreaching\u201d when it comes to long-term residents of the United States. She said there was \u201cstartling evidence\u201d from national security professionals that the order \u201cmay be counterproductive to its stated goal\u201d of keeping the nation safe.\n\nThe 9th Circuit judges also rejected the Justice Department\u2019s request to narrow a lower-court judge\u2019s freeze of the ban, saying that even if that freeze was too broad, it is \u201cnot our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order.\u201d They asserted their authority to serve as a check on the president\u2019s power, while noting that their ruling was limited to whether the ban should be temporarily suspended.\n\nThe president has forcefully said all week that judges were wrong in their decisions on his order and that immigration law gives him broad authority to restrict foreigners from entering the United States. On Friday he posted on Twitter a quote from a Lawfare article, which noted that the 9th Circuit judges had not cited in their opinion the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives him such powers.\n\n[Federal judge: Courts \u2018begging\u2019 for evidence to support Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nThere seemed to be a growing view from commentators on the right, though, that the Trump administration might be better off to abandon this fight, rewrite portions of the executive order and thus be on more solid ground for future legal battles.\n\nEdward Whelan, an influential voice in the conservative legal world who writes for the National Review Online, indicated on Twitter that he had doubts about the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling but also concerns about whether the Supreme Court would reinstate an executive order he viewed as flawed.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201c2 modest propositions: (1) Courts are getting it wrong on EO; and (2) this is not the right legal battle to fight. Do the EO right this time.\u201d \u201cEO\u201d is a common abbreviation for \u201cexecutive order.\u201d\n\nIn the court hearing before the 9th Circuit, Justice Department lawyers offered a possible concession. The court, they said, could permit travel for those \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future,\u201d but not, perhaps, for those without visas already.\n\nThe judges rejected that argument, saying that such relief would not help U.S. citizens who \u201chave an interest in specific non-citizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States,\u201d nor would it allay concerns about the due-process rights of people in the country illegally.\n\nJustice Department lawyers also argued that the ban no longer applied to green-card holders \u2014 citing guidance from the White House counsel issued after the ban took effect \u2014 and that challenges on those grounds should thus be invalidated. On that, too, the judges disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cMoreover, in light of the Government\u2019s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe White House could adjust the order in other ways, such as by exempting students or other categories of people. That would be significant because it might affect the ability of states such as Washington and Minnesota to have adequate standing to sue.\n\nBut analysts said the administration is likely to still face vigorous challenges.\n\n\u201cWhatever they do, I think they\u2019re running into a problem,\u201d said Reaz H. Jafri, the global head of immigration at the Withersworldwide law firm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what type of a ban they can possibly craft that can be constitutional.\u201d\n\nRobert Barnes and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "type": "article"}
