The Trump administration has advanced a stricter interpretation of what kind of family relationships could entitle a person to receive a U.S. visa, but a lower court in Hawaii ruled that the criteria were too tight.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s action on Wednesday had two parts. In one, the justices said they will not disturb the lower court\u2019s decision that expanded the definition of close family ties.\n\nBut in another, the justices granted the government\u2019s request to put on hold a part of the lower court\u2019s order that would have made it easier for more refugees to enter the country. That order could have granted entry to about 24,000 refugees who were already working with resettlement agencies.\n\nWednesday\u2019s unsigned, one-paragraph order gave no reasoning for the Supreme Court\u2019s action. Three justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have granted the administration\u2019s request to put the entire order on hold.\n\nThe majority said the government\u2019s appeal of the lower court\u2019s ruling should go through normal channels, with the next stop at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nThe Justice Department reacted to the action only by saying it \u201clooks forward to presenting its arguments to the 9th Circuit.\u201d\n\nHawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement that the court\u2019s action \u201cconfirms we were right to say that the Trump Administration over-reached in trying to unilaterally keep families apart from each other.\u201d\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center said in a news release that although \u201cfamily unity won today,\u201d it will continue to litigate \u201cto ensure that refugees can find the shelter they were offered by settlement agencies in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was the latest development in the Trump administration\u2019s nearly six-month effort to temporarily shut down the nation\u2019s refu\u00adgee program and bar visitors from several majority-Muslim countries while officials examine vetting procedures.\n\n[Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump travel ban]\n\nThe Trump administration has said the effort was needed to protect the country. Challengers have fought the ban as an unconstitutional effort at keeping out Muslims, a policy that Trump had advocated during the presidential campaign.\n\nThe latest version of the ban bars visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. These restrictions and the refu\u00adgee ban had been put on hold by lower courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on the merits of the challenge to the administration\u2019s travel ban on Oct. 10. In the meantime, the court said last month that the ban could go into effect and be applied to those without connections to the United States but that foreigners with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States must be exempted from the ban.\n\nThe justices did not define such a relationship but gave examples of what would qualify for the exemption: a close relative in the United States, a place in an American university, a job offer or speaking engagement.\n\nThe Trump administration interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201cclose familial relationship\u201d to be a parent, spouse, fiance, son or daughter, sibling, son-in-law or daughter-in-law in the United States. The government would continue to bar refugees who had offers from refu\u00adgee resettlement programs.\n\nThe challengers went back to U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson of Hawaii, who had earlier issued a nationwide injunction against the ban. Watson ruled last week that the government\u2019s \u201cnarrowly defined list\u201d of exemptions was not supported by either the Supreme Court decision or by the law.\n\n[Judge rules Trump administration too restrictive in travel ban implementation]\n\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nHe extended the exemptions to include those with grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. Watson wrote that refugees with assurances from resettlement agencies are also exempt from the ban.\n\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to stay Watson\u2019s ruling.\n\nWatson\u2019s interpretation of what kinds of family relationships qualify \u201cempties the court\u2019s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just \u2018close\u2019 family members, but virtually all family members,\u201d the administration said in its brief to the court. \u201cTreating all of these relationships as \u2018close familial relationships\u2019 reads the term \u2018close\u2019 out of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nThe administration added that Watson\u2019s ruling would cover virtually all refugees.\n\nThe state of Hawaii, which has been a leader in the challenge to the travel ban, told the justices that the government\u2019s argument was \u201cnonsense.\u201d Any rule that maintained that grandparents are not close familial relations was suspect as applied both to those who sought visas and to refugees, the state said in its brief to the court.\n\n\u201cThat argument is as wrong as it sounds, and nothing in this court\u2019s opinion, the immigration laws, or common sense supports it,\u201d the state wrote.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "type": "article"}
