(Reuters)\n\nOver and over again, President Trump has blasted major media organizations as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cdishonest\u201d and, quite commonly, \u201cfailing.\u201d If so, they\u2019re failing their way right into his head.\n\nThe influence of the mainstream media on Trump arose this afternoon at a White House press briefing under the leadership of press secretary Sean Spicer. In the course of the proceedings, Spicer fielded a question about the last week\u2019s executive order temporarily barring entry into the United States of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. \u201cHe\u2019s also made clear that it\u2019s not a Muslim ban, it\u2019s not a travel ban. It\u2019s a vetting system to keep America safe,\u201d said Spicer. To repeat: Not a a ban!\n\nMeanwhile: Trump loyalist Rudy Giuliani, in a television interview, elaborated on the provenance of this non-ban: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally,'\u201d Giuliani said on Fox News.\n\nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nFollowing up on Spicer\u2019s protestations about the word \u201cban,\u201d NBC News White House Correspondent Kristen Welker noted the tweet above: \u201cHe says it\u2019s a ban.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the wonderful symbiosis and spirit of cooperation between the White House and its press corps, Spicer responded, \u201cHe\u2019s using the words that the media\u2019s using,\u201d said Spicer in a tribute to the overwhelming power of the modern media. \u201cBut at the end of the day \u2026 it can\u2019t be a ban if you\u2019re letting a million people in.\u201d\n\nWelker wasn\u2019t going to accept that tripe. So she pointedly noted that the president had called it a ban. \u201cIs he confused or are you confused?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not confused. I think that the words being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this. He has been very clear, it is \u2018extreme vetting.'\u201d Except for that tweet, which has been retweeted nearly 34,000 times and liked nearly 160,000 times.\n\nPerhaps Welker\u2019s remarkable moment of accountability journalism can set to rest all that silly talk that the media shouldn\u2019t pay much heed to Trump\u2019s tweets. Or maybe media organizations should check with Spicer & Co. before characterizing Trump administration initiatives to avoid overly influencing the president of the United States.
