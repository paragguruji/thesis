(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Trump\u2019s travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called \u201cjudicial usurpation of power.\u201d\n\nWhite House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the author of the controversial executive order, said the administration was weighing several legal options after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously on Thursday against reinstating the travel ban, which had been blocked temporarily by a federal judge in Washington state.\n\nMiller said that officials are considering appealing with the 9th Circuit and having an emergency hearing \u201cen banc,\u201d or before a larger panel of judges on the court; seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court; taking the case to trial at the district level; or writing a new executive order for Trump to sign that would withstand legal scrutiny.\n\nIn unusually combative interviews on the Sunday morning television shows, Miller also refused to say whether Trump still has confidence in his national security adviser amid controversy over his communications with Russian officials. Miller also advanced false claims that widespread voter fraud undermined Trump\u2019s performance in November\u2019s election.\n\n[National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials, officials say]\n\nMiller insisted that Trump has the constitutional authority to ban the entry of certain foreigners, saying the actions represent \u201cthe very apex of presidential authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say something very clearly, and this is going to be very disappointing to the people protesting the president and the people in Congress, like [Senate Democratic Leader Charles E.] Schumer, who have attacked the president for his lawful and necessary action: The president\u2019s powers here are beyond question,\u201d Miller said on Fox News.\n\nAppearing also on ABC News, Miller said, \u201cA district judge in Seattle cannot force the president of the United States to change our laws and our Constitution because of their own personal views. The president has the power \u2026 to suspend the entry of aliens when it\u2019s in the national interest.\u201d\n\n[Trump considers writing \u2018brand new\u2019 immigration order]\n\nMiller said on CBS News that the judiciary was acting like \u201ca supreme branch of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country,\u201d Miller told anchor John Dickerson. \u201cI mean, this is just crazy, John. The idea that you\u2019re going to have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d\n\nMiller also suggested that the legal debate was not over the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s action, but rather over ideology.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional right for a citizen in a foreign country, who has no status in America, to demand entry into our country,\u201d the adviser said on ABC. \u201cSuch a right cannot exist. Such a right will never exist. This is an ideological disagreement between those who believe we should have borders and should have controls and those who believe there should be no borders and no controls.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s exchanges with the Sunday show hosts were testy on other subjects as well. He punted when ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked him about The Washington Post\u2019s report that Michael Flynn discussed the then-Obama administration\u2019s sanctions against Russia in conversations with that country\u2019s ambassador before Flynn was sworn in as White House national security adviser.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any news to make you today on this point,\u201d Miller said, prompting Stephanopoulos to ask, \u201cThen why are you coming in if you can\u2019t answer the questions being posed about the White House?\u201d\n\nOn NBC, when anchor Chuck Todd asked Miller whether Trump still had confidence in Flynn, Miller said he did not know. Miller said his colleagues in the White House \u201cdid not give me anything to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell you what\u2019s in the president\u2019s mind,\u201d he told Todd. \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the president.\u201d\n\n[Stephen Miller: A key engineer for Trump\u2019s \u2018America first\u2019 agenda]\n\nMiller also repeated the false claim that Trump underperformed in the general election because of \u201cmassive voter fraud.\u201d Miller provided no evidence to support his assertions in his ABC appearance \u2014 something Stephanopoulos pointed out to viewers.\n\nMiller repeated claims Trump made privately to senators this past week that he narrowly lost the general election in New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to vote illegally there.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who\u2019s worked in New Hampshire politics,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s very real. It\u2019s very serious.\u201d\n\nThere is no known evidence of this happening.\n\nMiller went on to say that there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d of people being registered to vote in more than one state, of \u201cdead people voting\u201d and noncitizens being registered to vote.\n\n\u201cGeorge, it is a fact \u2014 and you will not deny it \u2014 that there are massive numbers of noncitizens in this country who are registered to vote,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat is a scandal. We should stop the presses. And, as a country, we should be aghast about the fact that you have people who have no right to vote in this country registered to vote, canceling out the franchise of lawful citizens of this country.\u201d\n\nAt that, Stephanopoulos intoned: \u201cFor the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence that the president\u2019s claim that he would have won the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn\u2019t voted \u2014 zero evidence for either one of those claims.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s combative appearances pleased his boss, who apparently was watching from Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump tweeted: \u201cCongratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows.
