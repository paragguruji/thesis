(Reuters)\n\nUpdate: And sure enough, just a day after Spicer took issue with calling it a \"ban,\" Trump tweeted that the word doesn't really matter.

Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2017\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer had a message for the news media at a briefing Tuesday: You guys caused the confusion about the Trump administration's new temporary travel ban ... by calling it a travel \u201cban.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's not a travel ban,\u201d Spicer said, adding: \"Because when we use words like 'travel ban,' that misrepresents what it is.\"\n\nAt least, that's what he said Tuesday. On Monday, he used the term himself. At an appearance at George Washington University, he said that \u201cthe ban deals with seven countries that the Obama administration had previously identified as needing further travel restrictions.\u201d\n\nHe wasn't the only member of the Trump team to embrace the word:\n\nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nTrump also called it a \u201cban\u201d on Saturday, saying \u201cWe're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d And Kellyanne Conway used the b-word Sunday, saying, \"This is a ban on travel, prospective travel from countries, trying to prevent terrorists in this country...\"\n\nSo four times in three days.\n\nWhen the tweet above was pointed out at Tuesday's briefing, Spicer insisted Trump was just \u201cusing the words that the media is using.\" (We assume the press secretary would say he was doing the same thing himself Monday.)\n\n\u201cBut it can't be ... a ban if you're letting a million people in, if 325,000 people from another country can't come in,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThat, by nature, is not a ban.\u201d\n\nNBC's Kristen Welker asked if the message was getting confused.\n\n\u201cI'm not confused,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThe words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling it. He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting.\u201d\n\nspicer: it's not a ban\n\nreporter: but the president called it a ban\n\nspicer: it's not\n\nreporter: is he confused or u?\n\nspicer: i'm not confused pic.twitter.com/i4wWuuZ7JT \u2014 David Mack (@davidmackau) January 31, 2017\n\nExcept that the administration also kinda, sorta says it's not \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d either \u2014 or at least, it did when that characterization didn't suit its purposes.\n\nIn its memo announcing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates's firing late Monday, the White House seemed to take issue with that adjective.\n\n\u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nOkay, on this latter one, maybe they get a pass. They seem to be saying that although the vetting will be \u201cextreme,\u201d the policy itself isn't (?). It's still very mixed messaging.\n\nBut the first one just doesn't make sense. If it's so wrong to call this a travel \u201cban,\u201d the White House's three leading public messengers should know not to call it that. They both did ... on Monday. That's Political Messaging 101. And although it's perhaps understandable that Trump would goof and use the wrong word, Spicer knows better. If avoiding the word \u201cban\u201d was the strategy, he wouldn't have used it Monday. And we would have seen pushback on its use earlier than five days after the ban was enacted.\n\nIn the end, it looks like more grasping at straws when it comes to explaining how poor the implementation was \u2014 almost as though they didn't have a plan to implement it or a plan to sell it publicly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "quibbles", "extreme", "trump", "spicer", "ban", "used", "bizarrely", "vetting", "calling", "backs", "house", "white", "team"], "summary": "(Reuters)Update: And sure enough, just a day after Spicer took issue with calling it a \"ban,\" Trump tweeted that the word doesn't really matter.\nIt doesn't seem the White House has any kind of a cogent or coordinated messaging strategy here.\n\u2014 Donald J.
