They chose not to.\n\nThe sloppily executed travel ban, produced under the auspices of attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, has been blocked in part by federal judges, while the acting attorney general, doubting the order\u2019s legality, said she would not defend it. Trump aides reacted with conflicting signals of whether they would honor the court orders and by firing the acting attorney general \u2014 Trump\u2019s own version of Richard Nixon\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre, after just 10 days on the job.\n\nMany Republican lawmakers voiced their objections. But given a chance to do something about the offending order, they demurred.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee met Tuesday morning to vote on the Sessions nomination \u2014 a perfect leverage point to force Trump to revise or withdraw the order. Not one of the Republicans made a peep.\n\n(Alice Li,Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n\nOne of those on the panel, Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), had called the order \u201cunacceptable\u201d as written.\n\nBut Flake said nothing of that Tuesday morning in his brief statement calling Sessions \u201ca good man.\u201d\n\nAnother on the panel, Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), had said in a joint statement with John McCain (R-Ariz.) that the \u201corder was not properly vetted\u201d and that \u201cwe should not turn our backs\u201d on blameless refugees, mostly women and children, who \u201csuffered unspeakable horrors.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday, Graham \u201centhusiastically\u201d saluted the man behind the order.\n\nAlso on the committee: Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who called the order \u201ctoo broad\u201d and cautioned that it could help terrorist recruiters.\n\nSasse didn\u2019t speak at Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nIt\u2019s commendable that many Republicans have spoken out against Trump\u2019s travel ban. But the disconnect between what they say and what they do was particularly pronounced Tuesday morning.\n\n(Adriana Usero,Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Philip Rucker and Robert Costa reported, Sessions has been the \u201cintellectual godfather\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies, including the travel restrictions. Key Trump aides Stephen Miller, Rick Dearborn and Stephen K. Bannon have strong ties to Sessions, and Bannon called Sessions \u201cthe clearinghouse for policy.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone, a Trump confidant, described Sessions as Trump\u2019s John Mitchell \u2014 the Nixon attorney general who wound up in prison after an earlier constitutional crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s not much of an exaggeration to describe the current situation as a constitutional crisis \u2014 except in this instance, those in the legislative branch have quickly surrendered the Article I authorities given them in the Constitution.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong case that Trump\u2019s unilateral action violates federal law, and the cavalier treatment of court orders is worrisome regardless of the outcome. But Senate Republicans have twice blocked attempts by the Democrats to rescind the order \u2014 swallowing their own misgivings along the way.\n\nBack in December 2015, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), asked about Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to follow that suggestion.\u201d He called the proposal \u201ccompletely and totally inconsistent with American values.\u201d Six months later, he was still arguing that \u201ca kind of broad ban is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nNow Trump is doing just such a ban in the affected countries, a Muslim ban in all but name, and McConnell is punting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far.\u201d\n\nDemocrats delayed action on three of Trump\u2019s nominees Tuesday to protest the executive\u2019s caprice, but ultimately only the majority GOP can stop Trump. And the Republicans will never have more bargaining power than they have now, with several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees unconfirmed.\n\nDemocrats forced a one-day delay in the vote on Sessions with long-winded speeches on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThis is an administration that needed only one week to find itself on the losing side of an argument in federal court,\u201d Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said. \u201cNever, ever seen anything like that.\u201d\n\nMazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) tied the Muslim ban to the internment of U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II, and she praised Republicans such as Sasse, Flake, Graham and Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) for their critical statements.\n\nBut what about actions?\n\nHatch had previously encouraged Trump to \u201cmove quickly to tailor its policy . . . as narrowly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t press the point Tuesday, instead calling Sessions\u2019s qualifications \u201cunmatched in American history.\u201d\n\nChairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) had cautioned about the need to remain \u201ca welcoming nation.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday he concentrated on Sessions\u2019s \u201cintegrity.\u201d\n\nMike Lee (R-Utah), also on the panel, had previously raised \u201cquestions\u201d about Trump\u2019s order.\n\nBut he had no questions Tuesday. Lee praised Sessions\u2019s \u201cdeep commitment to the notion\u201d that \u201claws govern us rather than the will and whim of individual humans.\u201d\n\nThat was the notion, anyway \u2014 until 10 days ago.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "type": "article"}
