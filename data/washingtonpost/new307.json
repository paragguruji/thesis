(Don Emmert/AFP)\n\nCanada\u2019s Girl Guides have added a nation to the places they fear to tread. And it\u2019s right next door.\n\nThe organization has called off all trips to the United States until further notice, citing a \u201ccommitment to inclusivity\u201d in what is widely interpreted as a stand against the Trump administration\u2019s effort to restore a travel ban against six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe Guides \u2014 the Canadian counterparts of the Girl Scouts \u2014 did not specifically mention the U.S. travel restrictions, which are set to take effect Thursday unless blocked again by various court challenges. But there was little doubt that the White House moves were behind the decision by the 70,000-member Girl Guides.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, the group said the \u201cability of all our members to equally enter this country is currently uncertain\u201d \u2014 suggesting that Muslim or foreign-born members might face difficulties at U.S. airports and border crossings.\n\n[The full statement from the Girl Guides]\n\nUnder the new ban, all nationals from Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen would be blocked from obtaining visas to enter the United States for at least the next 90 days. Officials have said green-card holders or others with valid visas from the six nations can enter.\n\nThe Girl Guides is not the first group to reassess U.S. travel plans or business interactions because of the attempts by the White House to tighten travel rules and immigration controls. Many Mexican shoppers have heeded calls to boycott U.S. border towns, where the local economy often depends heavily on Mexican consumers.\n\nBut the decision by the Guides carries an extra sting because of the 107-year-old group\u2019s size and wholesome image.\n\nThe girl guides have more integrity & leadership than the entire Republican Party, plus they have cookies. https://t.co/AmKDos6McS \u2014 Andrew Tumilty (@AndrewTumilty) March 14, 2017\n\nThe group had planned a summer camping trip to California. That is now off the table, and so are other trips \u2014 and even transit at U.S. airports.\n\n\u201cWe know our members value the safe, inclusive and accepting space that Guiding provides,\u201d the group's statement added.\n\n\u201cThese values are reflected in all we do, including the Girl Guide travel experiences we offer girls and women. This was a very difficult decision to make,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe hope that members will appreciate this reflects our commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunities for all girls and women.\u201d\n\nGuides spokeswoman Sarah Kiriliuks told the Associated Press that she is unaware of any members being turned away by U.S. officials, but \u201cwe just want to make sure that no girl gets left behind.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau planned to visit New York on Wednesday for a Broadway performance celebrating his country's hospitality in a time of crisis. \u201cCome From Away\u201d tells the story of how Newfoundland hosted thousands of passengers \u2014 including many Americans \u2014 diverted from U.S. airports after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["girl", "america", "travel", "canadas", "guides", "irked", "canadian", "statement", "members", "trumps", "group", "border", "decided", "bans", "white", "decision", "snub"], "summary": "Canadian and American flags from the U.S. side of the border in Pittsburg, N.H.
