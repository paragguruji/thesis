Trump said that the goal is to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d and that priority for admission would be given to Christians.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Trump said of terrorists in a signing ceremony at the Pentagon. \u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\u201d\n\n[Annotated: The Trump administration\u2019s executive order on refugees and immigrants]\n\nIn an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network earlier Friday, Trump was asked whether he would prioritize persecuted Christians in the Middle East for admission as refugees, and he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian it was almost impossible. And the reason that was so unfair \u2014 everybody was persecuted, in all fairness \u2014 but they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cSo we are going to help them.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of the \u00adSyrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, many more Muslims than Christians have been killed or displaced because of the violence. A 2015 Washington Post poll found that 78 percent of Americans favored equal consideration for refugees regardless of religion.\n\nThe order was called \u201cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\u201d and contained a temporary entry ban that would affect citizens of seven countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.\n\n[These are people\u2019s lives they are playing with\u2019: World\u2019s airports turn into limbo for many under Trump order]\n\nThe order calls for a halt to the flow of refugees from Syria until further notice and suspends all refu\u00adgee admissions for 120 days until more analysis can determine which countries harbor the greatest threat. The annual intake of refugees for fiscal 2017 would also fall to 50,000 from more than 100,000 authorized now, according to the order.\n\nThe order also included a new policy that states and localities should have a say in determining whether refugees can resettle there. It calls for the secretary of homeland security to propose a way to make their involvement routine. Governors and mayors, mostly Republicans, have objected to refugees, once they are admitted to the country, being resettled in their jurisdictions, often in small and medium-size cities where the cost of living is lower than it is in big coastal cities.\n\nEarlier drafts of the order called for the creation of safe zones to protect civilians in Syria \u2014 a feature that could require committing thousands of ground troops. But in the final order, there was no mention of such zones.\n\nThe downsizing of the refu\u00adgee program, which had grown under the Obama administration, fulfills Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to start the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants and refugees, even though the United States already conducts the most rigorous and drawn-out screening process in the world.\n\nSyrians are subject to special attention because the Islamic State controls significant amounts of territory in their country. An estimated 11 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of fighting in 2011, with almost 5 million registered as refugees and more than 6 million internally displaced.\n\n[3 important facts about how the U.S. resettles Syrian refugees]\n\nU.S. vetting has changed significantly since the refu\u00adgee program was suspended for several months after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nAfter applicants register with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, that agency refers some of the most vulnerable to the United States. They include single mothers and their children, victims of violence and people with severe medical conditions requiring sophisticated treatment. Last year, the UNHCR referred more than 34,000 applicants, up from 16,000 in 2015 and 10,000 the year before that.\n\nSyrians being considered for resettlement in the United States pass through a complex, multi\u00adtiered background investigation. It involves biometric and database screening, personal interviews to look for inconsistencies in their stories, and security screenings by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.\n\nThe process typically takes nine months to two years to complete.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended in October, the United States admitted 12,500 Syrian refugees. An additional 3,500 were admitted for resettlement in the last three months of 2016. The overwhelming majority were women and children.\n\nNow, with Trump\u2019s executive \u00adorder, the flow grinds to an immediate halt. People who have sold their belongings in preparation for an imminent departure may not be allowed to board their flights to the United States. It was not immediately clear what would happen to those refugees already in the air when the order was signed.\n\n[\u2018Donald Trump destroyed my life,\u2019 says barred Iraqi who worked for U.S.]\n\nSome refu\u00adgees were finding their appointments with DHS officials canceled even before the order came into force , said Linda Hartke, head of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Unaccompanied refu\u00adgee minors living in camps, helped by the group, now cannot fly to the United States to live with foster families, she said.\n\nRefugee advocates slammed the order as cruel, while proponents of tighter immigration controls said it would protect Americans from radical Islamists who might try to sneak into the United States as refugees and launch an attack.\n\n\u201cThe ban on refugees will severely cripple the U.S. refugee program, leaving thousands who face life-threatening danger without humanitarian protection,\u201d said Greg Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThis policy does not make us safer. It shows weakness and withdraws our nation from the position as global leader when so many refugees urgently need protection.\u201d\n\n[Trump redefines the enemy and 15 years of counterterrorism policy]\n\nThe International Rescue Committee called suspending refu\u00adgee resettlement a \u201charmful and hasty\u201d decision that would affect thousands of innocent people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 awaiting resettlement to the United States. \u201cAmerica has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world,\u201d said David Miliband, head of the IRC. \u201cCertified by successive administrations, the U.S. resettlement program makes it harder to get to the United States as a refugee than any other route.\u201d\n\nBut skeptics of current vetting procedures question how effective they can be for refugees from a war-torn country such as Syria.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re looking for the perfect way to deal with this, I\u2019m not sure it exists,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). \u201cWhat we need to do is, the best we can, balancing the competing obligations of protecting people in imminent peril and the safety of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe UNHCR has warned for several years that the world is undergoing a refu\u00adgee and migration crisis of epic proportions, comparable only to the period after World War II. Some analysts caution that the decision to suspend refu\u00adgee admissions to a country that defines itself as a nation of immigrants could lead other governments to follow suit and undermine U.S. credibility.\n\n\u201cIf you want ironclad guarantees, you\u2019d have to stop all immigration, business travelers and students,\u201d said David Martin, who worked on immigration and refu\u00adgee policy at the State Department and DHS. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re not going to admit anybody to the United States, that\u2019s surrendering a key part of our heritage and blinding ourselves to genuine human suffering.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOpen doors, slamming gates: The tumultuous politics of U.S. immigration policy\n\nAmong veterans, raw responses to Trump\u2019s effort to block refugees and others\n\nAre you, or someone you know, affected by President Trump\u2019s travel restrictions?", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "type": "article"}
