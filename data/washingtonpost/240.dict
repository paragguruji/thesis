Robart on Feb. 3 issued a ruling temporarily blocking the enforcement of President Trump's executive order barring entry to the United States for citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. (U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington)\n\nJudge James L. Robart wore a bow tie to the hearing, opened with a joke and finished with a thunderclap.\n\nHe was known for that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cThe amicus law professors,\u201d Robart said Friday, noting the many groups that waited in his Seattle courtroom to argue for or against a motion to halt President Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u201cSounds like the three amigos.\u201d\n\nPeople laughed, despite the tension. The federal judge had a habit of mixing soft speech and extraordinary pronouncements.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, with no jokes or spare words; Robart halted Trump\u2019s ban and potentially changed the fate of citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and tens of thousands of refugees, who had been denied entry into the United States.\n\nHis order challenges a White House that had spent all week defending the travel ban.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump said in a tweet Saturday morning.\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nBut Robart has been called judge for more than a decade. President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal court for Washington state\u2019s western district court in 2004, choosing him from a shortlist of nominees selected by a bipartisan commission.\n\nAlthough he had held no judgeship before, senators of both parties praised Robart.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced him to the judiciary committee as a man who had fostered six children with his wife. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) went over Robart\u2019s 30 years as a lawyer \u2014 up to his work at the time as managing partner at a Seattle law firm. Robart graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1973.\n\nSen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) noted Robart\u2019s \u201crepresentation of the disadvantaged\u201d \u2014 including his work representing \u201csoutheast Asian refugees.\u201d\n\nAsked about such work at his confirmation hearing, Robart gave a short speech about fairness in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cI was introduced to people who, in many times, felt that the legal system was stacked against them or was unfair,\u201d Robart told the senators. \u201cWorking with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThat is a great answer.\u201d\n\nNo one opposed his confirmation.\n\nIn his 13 years on the federal bench, the judge handed down criminal sentences no lighter than the law recommended \u2014 78 months in prison for a crack dealer, life for a man who murdered a woman on a Native American reservation two decades earlier.\n\nHis job as a federal judge got more complicated after Seattle police fatally shot John T. Williams \u2014 a partially deaf woodcarver who did not put down his carving knife one day in 2010.\n\nHundreds surrounded a Seattle police station to protest Williams\u2019s death, which had followed other accusations of police brutality in the city. A Justice Department investigation \u201cfound routine and widespread use of excessive force by officers,\u201d the Seattle Times reported. That led to settlements and lawsuits \u2014 the bow-tied Robart presiding.\n\n\u201cWell, there certainly are a lot of you,\u201d he said in August. His tie was green, his beard as white as ever.\n\nIn the years since Williams\u2019s death, the Seattle case had evolved from passionate protests and a federal investigation into a string of hearings to oversee police reforms.\n\nAugust\u2019s hearing was one of many, and Robart gave no indication at the beginning that it would be anything of special note. He listened to each side, as he had many times before. When it was his turn to speak, he went over schedules, comments and consent decrees to come.\n\nThen he took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cI will now step back from my very precise legal practice and give you the following observation \u2014 from me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke of the police \u2014 their training and accountability and leadership. \u201cThe men and women who go out and walk around Seattle and proudly wear the Seattle Police Department uniform,\u201d he said, \u201c \u2026 are entitled to know what they may and may not do.\u201d\n\nHe breathed in again. Then he spoke of protests against police that had spread across the country, and FBI statistics showing that black people are twice as likely to be shot dead by police as their share of the population would warrant.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s do-it-himself approach just suffered a big \u2014 and unusual \u2014 early setback]\n\n\u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d the judge said.\n\nHis words, the Seattle Times noted, caused \u201ca startled, audible reaction\u201d in the courtroom. Here was a federal judge echoing a slogan used by protesters.\n\nRobart was not done. \u201cBlack people are not alone in this,\u201d he went on. \u201cHispanics, Asians, Native Americans are also involved. And lastly and importantly: Police deaths in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Minneapolis and let\u2019s not forget Lakewood, Washington, remind us of the importance of what we are doing.\u201d\n\nIf his words were extraordinary, he gave no indication that day. Robart thanked everyone before him \u201cfor your hard work\u201d and walked out the door behind him.\n\n\u201cIt was an interesting message to the community from a white Republican federal judge,\u201d said Mike McKay, a former U.S. attorney who used to partner with Robart in private practice, and has known him throughout his legal career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear what he was trying to do: show I\u2019m listening and sensitive to all parties.\u201d\n\nMcKay co-chaired the bipartisan committee that put Robart on a shortlist in 2003, when Bush chose him to become a federal judge. His Democratic co-chair, Jenny Durkan, agreed with McKay\u2019s take on the judge.\n\n\u201cIf you were to typecast a conservative Republican judge, it would look a lot like Judge Robart,\u201d said Durkan, who became a U.S. attorney after Robart joined the federal bench and argued before him in the Seattle hearings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve felt Judge Robart\u2019s wrath and also had rulings that went my way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make the ruling he thinks is the right ruling and not worry about who disagrees with him \u2014 even the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nHalf a year after Robart\u2019s \u201cblack lives matter\u201d speech, a president did just that.\n\nRobart listened for nearly an hour to arguments of the federal government and to those who oppose its travel ban, then thanked everyone for their \u201cthoughtful\u201d remarks.\n\nHe tried to tramp down any anticipation. A judge\u2019s job, Robart said, \u201cis not to judge the wisdom of any policy,\u201d but only whether it was legal.\n\nHe would not even do that at the moment, he said, but merely consider whether Trump\u2019s order should be blocked temporarily to prevent \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury\u201d to the people it affects.\n\nRobart looked down at his papers and issued his order.\n\nThe travel ban must be halted not just in Washington state, he said, but for all \u201cfederal defendants and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and persons acting in concert \u2026 at all U.S. borders and port of entry, pending further order from this court.\u201d\n\nHe promised to help the government file a speedy appeal to his decision, then collected his papers and recessed.\n\nThis story has been corrected. An earlier version mischaracterized the final moments of Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading:\n\nAfter Trump pledges \u2018America first,\u2019 the world responds with protests and dismay\n\nTrump\u2019s rallying cry: Fear itself", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
