(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court granted constitutional protections to an Afro-Cuban religious group that sacrifices animals, such goats, chickens, ducks and turtles, as a form of ritual.\n\nMore than two decades later, specifically Thursday, three federal appeals court judges relied partly on that ruling when they declined to reinstate President Trump\u2019s controversial entry ban on refugees and citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe states of Washington and Minnesota, which sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order, cited the president\u2019s fiery rhetoric and a previous statement about a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the country to prove that his directive was meant to discriminate against one religion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed, citing the 23-year-old Supreme Court ruling on animal sacrifices as precedent.\n\nIn the 1993 case, the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc., a Florida nonprofit group, sued the city of Hialeah, Fla., in federal court, saying its ordinances prohibiting animal sacrifices violate the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the free exercise of religion. The group practices Santer\u00eda, which has been described as a \u201cfusion\u201d between elements of Roman Catholicism and the religion of Western Africa\u2019s Yoruba people, who were brought as slaves to Cuba.\n\n[Trump\u2019s loose talk about Muslims gets weaponized in court against travel ban]\n\nThe city won. A federal district judge ruled that the ordinances are meant to protect public health and welfare and the laws\u2019 effects on religious practice are merely incidental. A federal appeals court upheld the ruling. The Supreme Court reversed it in June 1993.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who\u2019s still on the bench, wrote that the city\u2019s laws were unconstitutional because they targeted the Santer\u00eda religion and its practices, but not other similar activities that harm animals, like slaughtering them for food.\n\n\u201cThe principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice is so well understood that few violations are recorded in our opinions,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cOur review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the Nation\u2019s essential commitment to religious freedom.\u201d\n\nGovernmental interests of protecting public health and preventing animal cruelty can be addressed in other less restrictive ways, such as regulations on how to dispose of organic garbage, how to care for animals, or how to slaughter them, Kennedy wrote.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling suspending President Trump's controversial immigration order barring refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The White House said on Feb. 10 that it is \"reviewing all options,\" including possibly going to the Supreme Court. (Peter Stevenson,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nBelievers of Santer\u00eda worship the spirits called orishas, and they mainly show their devotion through animal sacrifices performed at birth, marriage and death rites. Their rituals are also done to cure the sick and during the initiation of new members and priests. The sacrificed animals are cooked and eaten at ceremonies, except after healing and death rituals.\n\nThe idea of animal sacrifices alarmed residents of Hialeah, so much so that the City Council called an emergency public session and enacted several resolutions and ordinances banning religious sacrifices. The laws were passed in 1987, after the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc. leased a piece of property in the city and announced plans to build a complex that would include a house of worship, a school, a cultural center and a museum.\n\nTo make the case that the laws unconstitutionally targeted a religious group, the justices cited one of the resolutions enacted by city leaders. It stated: \u201cThis community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens.\u201d\n\nThe justices also listed public statements that city leaders made about Santer\u00eda.\n\nOne council member said during a public meeting that believers \u201care in violation of everything this country stands for.\u201d The president of the City Council also asked during a meeting, \u201cWhat can we do to prevent the church from opening?\u201d\n\n[Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban]\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Trump\u2019s travel ban, the appeals court relied on the president\u2019s previous statements about Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn Hialeah in the 1990s, it was Santeria. With Trump, it\u2019s Muslims,\u201d University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, an expert of religious liberties who argued the Hialeah case, told the Miami Herald.\n\nShortly after the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the administration, Trump announced that he is considering rewriting his executive order. The president told reporters on Air Force One that he would probably wait until Monday or Tuesday to take any action. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also said that several options \u2014 including taking the case to the Supreme Court \u2014 were still on the table.\n\nMatt Zapotosky, Philip Rucker and Rachel Weiner contributed to this story.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n7 key take-aways from the court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s immigration order\n\nFederal judge: Courts \u2018begging\u2019 for evidence to support Trump\u2019s travel ban\n\nStephen Miller: A key engineer for Trump\u2019s \u2018America first\u2019 agenda", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/kristineaguerra", "type": "article"}
