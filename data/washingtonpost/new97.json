(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nDemocrats vowed Sunday to introduce legislation to reverse President Trump\u2019s orders implementing a travel ban from certain countries, with at least one senator saying the moves should lead to slower consideration of the president\u2019s top Cabinet nominees.\n\n\u201cThese orders go against what America has always been about. The orders make us less humanitarian, less safe, less American,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during his regularly scheduled news Sunday morning conference in New York as he announced that his colleagues were working on new legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re demanding the president reverse these executive orders that go against what we are, everything we have always stood for,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer choked up as he described the chaos the orders had caused. Trump\u2019s order was \u201cmean-spirited and un-American,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was implemented in a way that created chaos and confusion across the country, and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe those that will do us harm. It must be reversed immediately.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Jan. 29 got emotional during a news conference in which he opposed President Trump's executive order barring U.S. entry from refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cWe will fight this,\u201d he added. \u201cMany of you may not know this \u2014 my middle name is Ellis. I was named after Uncle Ellis who was named after Ellis Island. This fight\u2019s in my bones. It\u2019s on my birth certificate.\u201d\n\nSen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.). (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nSenior aides said several Democratic lawmakers were working on legislative remedies. Among them is Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who said he plans to introduce a bill that would overturn Trump\u2019s orders by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support, that overturns the ban,\u201d he said in an interview on Sunday.\n\nTrump \u201cclearly campaigned on this ban but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous,\u201d Murphy added.\n\nGiven that stance, Murphy said Democrats must now \u201cforce a debate\u201d this week on Trump\u2019s orders by slowing the consideration of all of his remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, set to serve as the next secretary of state.\n\n\u201cWe should take every ounce of time that we\u2019re allowed on these nominees, to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration especially when it comes to foreign policy,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy noted that the Senate quickly confirmed James Mattis, the widely respected former Marine general, to serve as defense secretary, \u201cbecause he assured us that he was going to argue against the very ban he watched Trump sign. Many of us gave the president and his Cabinet a little benefit of the doubt last week. I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any reason that that should continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost every single one of these nominees try to prop up their nomination by contradicting Trump in their confirmation hearing. It\u2019s pretty clear now that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are running this administration and the nominees that have been confirmed thus far have been marginalized,\u201d Murphy added.\n\nSchumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and others.\n\n\u201cIf we get a few more Republicans I think we might be able to get legislation to overturn it. It\u2019ll be up to getting more Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Murphy tweeted an image of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year old Syrian boy who drowned as he and his parents were trying to flee their home country.\n\n\u201cTo my colleagues: don\u2019t ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\u201d Murphy tweeted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "ban", "orders", "democrats", "block", "vow", "republicans", "week", "president", "trumps", "legislation", "senate", "nominees", "murphy"], "summary": "(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)Democrats vowed Sunday to introduce legislation to reverse President Trump\u2019s orders implementing a travel ban from certain countries, with at least one senator saying the moves should lead to slower consideration of the president\u2019s top Cabinet nominees.\n\u201cWe\u2019re demanding the president reverse these executive orders that go against what we are, everything we have always stood for,\u201d he said.\nSchumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including Sens.\n\u201cIf we get a few more Republicans I think we might be able to get legislation to overturn it.\n\u201cTo my colleagues: don\u2019t ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\u201d Murphy tweeted."}
