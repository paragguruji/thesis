(Evan Vucci, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban (all times local):\n\n10 p.m.\n\nThe Trump administration spent months hashing out new travel restrictions on more than a half-dozen countries, determined to avoid a repeat of the chaos that accompanied President Donald Trump\u2019s first version.\n\nBut critics say they\u2019re puzzled over the inclusion of some countries and believe Venezuela and North Korea were added to provide legal and political cover for what they say remains a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nThe new restrictions covering citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 and some Venezuelan government officials and their families \u2014 are to go into effect Oct. 18.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe Supreme Court has canceled arguments set for Oct. 10 in the dispute over President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, after Trump rolled out a new policy Sunday.\n\nThe unsigned order from the justices Monday asks both sides to weigh in by Oct. 5 about what to do with the case.\n\nThe court had been ready to hear argument about the legality of a 90-day ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries and a 120-day ban on refugees from around the world.\n\nThe ban expired Sunday and was replaced by a new policy that affects eight counties and has no expiration date.\n\nThose countries are Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nChad, North Korea and Venezuela were not covered by the earlier ban.\n\n___\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nChad\u2019s government says it learned \u201cwith astonishment\u201d of the decision by the U.S. government that its country is on a list whose nationals will be prohibited from entering the United States.\n\nA government statement Monday said the government expresses its incomprehension about the \u201cofficial reasons for this decision; which contrasts with Chad\u2019s constant efforts and commitments in the fight against terrorism at regional and global levels.\u201d\n\nChad\u2019s government called for a better appreciation of the situation and for Trump to reconsider the decision which it says \u201cundermines the image of Chad and the good relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nIt said it was open to discussions on strengthening collaborations with the U.S.\n\nChad is the headquarters for a multinational force set up to fight Nigeria-based Boko Haram Islamic extremists. -- AP reporter Dany Padire in N\u2019Djamena, Chad.\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (nee-koh-LAHS\u2019 mah-DOO\u2019-roh) says the Trump administration\u2019s decision to include Venezuelan officials on a travel ban is a form of \u201cpolitical and psychological terrorism.\u201d\n\nHis foreign ministry issued a statement Monday saying that the travel restrictions violate the values of the United Nations charter and international law and are part of a continuing effort by the U.S. to oust Maduro from power.\n\nThe ministry said it is considering \u201call necessary measures\u201d to defend Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty and national interest.\n\nThe Trump administration says Venezuela\u2019s government has been uncooperative in verifying whether its citizens represent national security threats and says the travel restrictions target officials at agencies and ministries responsible for screening.\n\nThe Trump administration also calls for Venezuelan nationals who are already visa holders to be subject to \u201cappropriate additional measures\u201d to ensure their traveler information remains current.\n\n___\n\n4:30 a.m.\n\nThe three major long-haul airlines of the Gulf say they are aware of the new travel restrictions implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nDubai-based Emirates said in a statement to The Associated Press: \u201cWith regards to entry requirements for travel to/from the USA, Emirates continues to take guidance provided to us by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\u201d\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, long-haul carrier Etihad said: \u201cThe airline continues to accept nationals with valid travel documentation from the listed countries. Acceptance, as per standard procedure, is subject to checks completed by U.S. authorities at the preclearance facility in Abu Dhabi International Airport.\u201d\n\nDoha-based Qatar Airways also said its operations continued as normal.\n\nThe travel ban, as well as the since-lifted ban on laptops in Mideast airliner cabins, has hurt Gulf carriers. Emirates has cut routes to the U.S.\n\nThe Gulf airlines also have faced stiff resistance from U.S. airlines, which accuse the Mideast carriers of being unfairly subsidized by their governments. The Gulf carriers strongly dispute that.\n\n___\n\n4:25 a.m.\n\nIn the streets of Tehran, Iranians say they are confused by the new travel ban instituted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nRoghieh Shahverdi, a 23-year-old secretary, told The Associated Press on Monday that she viewed it as \u201ca miserable decision.\u201d She said after waiting months she only just got a visa interview appointment for her mother to visit her sister, who has lived in the U.S. for six years.\n\nShahverdi said: \u201cAll the hopes of both are fading away.\u201d\n\nUniversity student Erfan Maddah wrote online that he was \u201ctotally confused\u201d by the decision.\n\nMaddah wrote: \u201cI have student visa appointment on October 4, I do not know if I have to continue or not.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:17 a.m.:\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for his administration\u2019s new travel ban.\n\nMohammed Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter early Monday: \u201cTrump\u2019s fake empathy for Iranians rings ever more hollow, with his new and even more offensive travel ban against such outstanding citizens.\u201d\n\nZarif, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, has taken to Twitter before to criticize Trump.\n\nIran previously was among the six majority Muslim nations targeted in the travel ban.\n\nThe new travel ban applies indefinite restrictions to citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea. The changes will take effect October 18.\n\n___\n\n2:50 a.m.\n\nNorth Korea hasn\u2019t reacted yet to newly announced U.S. travel restrictions, but they are largely a symbolic measure for the North Asian country already under severe sanctions because of its nuclear weapons program.\n\nMost or all of the North Koreans living in the United States are based at the country\u2019s diplomatic mission to the United Nations.\n\nThe restrictions in the proclamation President Donald Trump signed Sunday include the suspension of all immigrant and non-immigrant visas for North Korean nationals.\n\nSouth Korean analysts believe, though, the U.S. measure wouldn\u2019t target North Korean diplomats.\n\nCertain North Korean individuals are banned already due to sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea does not allow its ordinary citizens to travel abroad except in special cases, like jobs that bring in foreign currency or participation in sporting events.\n\n___\n\n2:10 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has signed a proclamation imposing strict new restrictions on travelers from a handful of countries, including five that were covered by his expiring travel ban. Administration officials say the new measures are required to keep the nation safe.\n\nThe indefinite restrictions apply to citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea. As part of the presidential proclamation signed Sunday, the U.S. will also bar the entry of certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate families.\n\nThe changes will take effect October 18.\n\nThe announcement came the same day that Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire, 90 days after it went into effect.\n\n___\n\nJon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Nasser Karimi in Tehran contributed to this story\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
