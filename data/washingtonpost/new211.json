Fiery protests and lawsuits made for a tumultuous weekend. Here's what you need to know. (Dalton Bennett,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Katherine Shaver,Monica Akhtar,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nTwo days into President Trump's new ban on refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven countries, there was still mass confusion about the details. On Sunday evening, the White House organized a briefing for reporters with two senior administration officials who agreed to explain the president's executive order \u2014 but only on the condition of anonymity.\n\nOne senior administration official explained the ground rules to reporters gathered at the White House and listening on a conference call, then said: \u201cWith that, I'll turn it over to a senior administration official.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the other senior administration official said before beginning a 45-minute defense.\n\nTheir overarching message: Everything is going exactly according to plan, nothing has changed since the order was signed, and the news media need to calm down their \u201cfalse, misleading, inaccurate, hyperventilating\u201d coverage of the \u201cfractional, marginal, minuscule percentage\u201d of international travelers who have been simply \u201cset aside for further questioning\u201d for a couple hours on their way into the greatest country in the world.\n\n\u201cIt really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level,\u201d the administration official said at one point.\n\nThe administration official said the order was drafted with help from \u201cseveral of the top immigration staff on Capitol Hill,\u201d then was approved by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and reviewed by some government agencies. The White House purposely implemented the ban with no warning because \u201ceverybody here can use their imaginations to imagine 25 reasons that wouldn't make sense from a security standpoint, a management standpoint, from just an airport-safety standpoint, you name it,\u201d the senior administration official said. (The other senior administration official jumped in at one point to make clear that the order \u201cisn\u2019t willy-nilly.\")\n\n[Amid protests and confusion, Trump defends executive order: \u2018This is not a Muslim ban\u2019]\n\nThere had been some confusion about how legal permanent residents \u2014 also known as green-card holders \u2014 would be treated under this new order. On Saturday, this same senior administration official told reporters that if a green-card holder from one the seven targeted countries is currently elsewhere in the world, that person would need to apply for a case-by-case waiver before returning to the United States. But then on Sunday morning, the president's chief of staff went onto a morning news show and said that the executive order \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect them.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials defended the president's executive order temporarily banning entry to the U.S. from seven mostly Muslim countries, but lawmakers from both parties expressed strong concern or objection. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d the senior administration official explained, claiming that the White House has provided clear instructions from the beginning on how green-card holders should navigate the system. These green-card holders are \u201cexempt\u201d from the new restrictions, the senior administration official said.\n\nA reporter jumped in: \u201cThat's different from what you said when we were in here yesterday, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the senior administration official said.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to pull the quote?\u201d the reporter said.\n\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe official then explained that green-card holders are exempt because they can apply for and receive a waiver. As of Sunday afternoon, 170 legal permanent residents had applied for waivers to avoid the new restrictions and all 170 had been granted those waivers.\n\n\u201cSome of the confusion stemming from the green-card issue is just semantic in nature,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cI think some of the confusion stems from the semantic debate about the meaning of the word 'exemption.' Again, internally, we've been clear on this from the beginning, and we've waived people through.\u201d\n\nPlus, the senior administration official said, the number of people who have to deal with these new restrictions is \u201ca fractional, marginal, minuscule percentage\u201d of the approximately 325,000 residents of other countries who arrive in the United States each day. During the first 24 hours that the executive order was in place, 109 people were \u201cset aside for further questioning,\u201d a situation that many others would describe as being detained by authorities.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the operation of the executive order, at the implementation level, it has been done seamlessly and with extraordinary professionalism,\u201d the senior administration official said at one point, later adding that these changes have been implemented with \u201cminimal disruption for other travelers.\u201d\n\n[Share your thoughts on the travel ban]\n\nA reporter asked the senior administration official to respond to Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who said Sunday: \u201cWe all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\u201d The senior administration official said the senator presumably misunderstands the order.\n\n\u201cHe might have read one of CNN's stories,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cAnd, for that, the only responsible party would be CNN.\u201d\n\nAfter another jargon-filled explanation of how everything is working the way it should, the senior administration official noted that \u201cprocesses for travel are always evolving\u201d and that \u201ctravel is proceeding as it should for those who should be traveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe important thing to keep in mind is that the United States runs the largest immigration system in the world,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cWe have about 80 million people, give or take a few million, that enter the United States through an air, land or sea port in a given year. The complexity and scope and reach of the immigration system is beyond imagination and, then again, there's sort of a strange irony \u2014 I don't know if irony is the right word \u2014 but there's something immensely disproportionate about people protesting that this year 79,999,900 or whatever will be processed through instead of the 80 million. I mean, you're talking about letting in more people than the size of almost every country on earth every single year.\u201d\n\nThe current immigration system is \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and if it's not changed, the senior administration official warned that it could lead to \u201cthe kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multidimensional and multi-generational and becomes sort of a permanent feature, in this case, it would become a permanent feature of American life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don't want a situation where 20, 30 years from now, it's just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis that there's domestic terror strikes, that stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cThese are the realities that we're living in today.\u201d\n\n[Inside Donald Trump\u2019s strategic decision to target Muslims]\n\nThe senior administration official said that the administration still wants to welcome new people \u201cwho truly believe in the American values that we all hold dear,\u201d but that it's the federal government's right to exclude those who would \u201cnot be able to be faithful to our tolerant way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I don't want to get into a long debate or to distract from what we're all discussing,\u201d the senior administration official said, \u201cbut I think that it's reasonable to say that you have to take a holistic look at applicants and that you could argue that if you admit say 50 people who aren't themselves terrorists but maybe who have sympathetic attitudes toward terrorists or who believe that there's an appropriate place for terrorism, that creates an environment where it's easy to radicalize people and to spread radical views and ideologies and, ultimately, to inculcate terrorism. ... You're removing a lot of the networks in which radicalization can take root and then at that point, again, become multi-generational.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the other senior administration official jumped in to explain the ban in another way: \u201cWhat would you rather have: Somebody delayed for a little while because we're taking the proper precautions... or a family member killed\u201d in a terrorist attack. \u201cWhich one would you choose?\u201d\n\nThe other senior administration official added this thought: \u201cIf I was welcomed to a new country and then just asked to wait for a few hours to have the review done, I wouldn't consider it a great injury.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, as the questions continued, the senior administration official tried to make this point again: \u201cYou have a hundred people who are given the greatest benefit imaginable, which is to spend time or to live permanently in the United States, but had to go through a little bit of extra delay. I want to make a point that \u2014 and I mean this very sincerely \u2014 which is that the United States chose not to be rigorous with respect to its immigration laws before Sept. 11, and 3,000 people were murdered. The United States chose not to be rigorous with its immigration law when the San Bernardino bride came in on a fiancee visa and 14 people were gunned down. ... And so on and on the examples go.\u201d\n\n[Conservative suspicions of refugees grow in wake of Paris attacks]\n\n\n\n\n\nA reporter pointed out that none of the home countries of those terrorists are included in the list of seven countries that the administration is targeting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf people in the media would like to recommend additional countries to be added, you can send us your suggestions,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cThe point that I am making is that we are putting in place over the next 90 days procedures to try to prevent those things from happening. ... I think it's important to keep in mind the job of the president is to protect the lives of American citizens, and the job of the media is to report fairly.\u201d\n\nThe other senior administration official then jumped in and ended the briefing.\n\n1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.
