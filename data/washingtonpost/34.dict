Wall about statements during the campaign and afterward in which Trump talked about a Muslim ban.\n\nWall said the order temporarily suspending foreign travelers from six majority Muslim countries was to protect the United States by reviewing the vetting of those who are potentially dangerous. That is not only within the president\u2019s authority, Wall said, it is his responsibility.\n\nBut Judge Barbara Milano Keenan said that could mean a candidate for president could call for a Muslim ban every day for a year, enact a cleverly worded plan that accomplished that on his first day in office, and have courts ignore whether targeting Muslims was his real purpose.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new policy temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and blocks new visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n(Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nIn March, a judge in Maryland and another in Hawaii halted enforcement of critical sections, pointing to comments by Trump and top advisers indicating that they wanted to bar Muslims from entry.\n\n[Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban]\n\nUnder intense questioning, Wall acknowledged it could violate the Constitution to single out a religion for adverse treatment. But he said Trump\u2019s revised executive order was neutral.\n\nJudge Pamela Harris pressed Wall. \u201cClearly the law has a disparate impact on Muslims,\u201d she said. \u201cIn what sense is it neutral?\u201d\n\nWall pointed out that the ban did not affect Muslims from countries other than the six mentioned in the order, and said the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that in matters of immigration and national security, the president\u2019s judgment is not open to judicial second-guessing.\n\n\u201cIt is not a Muslim ban,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 4th Circuit is considering whether to leave in place the Maryland decision siding with challengers who say the order violates First Amendment prohibitions on government condemnation of a particular religion.\n\n1 of 49 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 A look at President Trump\u2019s first year in office, so far View Photos The president\u2019s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

The losing party in either case is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\n[Federal appeals court maintains suspension of Trump's immigration order]\n\nA key issue for the court is whether judges should consider the rationale behind the policy beyond the language in the order itself. Many of the judges on Monday suggested they could not ignore the president\u2019s previous statements. Three judges, all nominated to the bench by Democrats, directly quoted Trump\u2019s remarks at the signing ceremony for the first travel ban in January.\n\nTrump said at the signing that the order was for \u201cthe protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d\n\n[Video of signing ceremony ]\n\nJudges Robert D. King, Henry F. Floyd and James A. Wynn Jr. referred to Trump\u2019s remarks several times during the hearing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never repudiated what he said about Muslims,\u201d King said.\n\nSeveral judges also asked whether a Trump campaign statement calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d was still on his website.\n\nThe statement was brought up during a White House news briefing early Monday, and it appeared to have been removed as the courthearing in Richmond got underway.\n\nIn response to the judges\u2019 questions, Wall said the meaning of Trump\u2019s statements after taking office was \u201cambiguous\u201d and that the court should defer to the president\u2019s judgment when it comes to keeping the nation safe.\n\nKeenan, however, repeatedly expressed doubts about the link between terrorism and foreign residents seeking travel visas from the six countries identified in the executive order.\n\nWhat is it about their nationality, she asked, that \u201crenders them suspect or renders them dangerous? I don\u2019t see anything in the text that does that.\u201d\n\nWall said the policy was designed to give the administration time to review the vetting procedures for granting visas from countries previously identified as areas of \u201cconcern\u201d by Congress and the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not saying they are all dangerous,\u201d Wall said of the Trump\u2019s thinking. \u201cHe\u2019s saying I\u2019m not certain.\u201d\n\n[Judges take Trump at his word \u2014 and that\u2019s not been good for the president]\n\nThe challenge in Maryland was brought by organizations and individuals, including a Muslim in the United States whose relative would be affected by the ban. They are being represented by the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nOmar Jadwat, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing the challengers, struggled at times as he faced tough questioning, mostly by the Republican-nominated members of the court.\n\n\u201cIs the executive not entitled to some deference?\u201d asked Judge Dennis W. Shedd.\n\nJudge Paul V. Niemeyer was a particularly tough questioner, saying the president is charged with making national security decisions and that the president would be responsible if someone entering the country committed a terrorist act.\n\nThe judiciary is the third branch of government, Niemeyer noted: \u201cDon\u2019t we have some respect for the first branch, and the second branch?\u201d\n\nBut Jadwat said the president is \u201cnot allowed to set a policy that violates the Establishment Clause,\u201d referring to the Constitution\u2019s command that government not favor one religion over another.\n\nIn a hypothetical, Jadwat speculated about how it would be perceived if a presidential candidate spoke of his dislike of Jews and, upon being elected, blocked travel from Israel because of a history of terrorist incidents there and the presence of a terrorist element in the country. The order might be neutral on its face, he said, but the intent would be clear.\n\nShedd asked whether Jadwat\u2019s position would differ if Trump had repudiated his campaign remarks about Muslims.\n\n\u201cWhat if he says \u2018sorry\u2019 every day for a year,\u201d Shedd quipped, drawing laughter from those seated in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that saying sorry isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Jadwat answered.\n\nHow quickly the 4th Circuit will rule is not known. But the court took the unusual step of bypassing the traditional three-judge panel and heard the case as a full group of 13. Two judges recused themselves: Allyson Kay Duncan, a George W. Bush nominee, and J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Ronald Reagan nominee.\n\nBarnes reported from Washington.
