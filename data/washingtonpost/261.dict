Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday that green-card holders would not be affected, but Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said they would be scrutinized and readmitted \u2014 or not \u2014 on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis.\n\nCouldn't the White House have maybe explained things a little better? Gotten everyone on the same page?\n\nThere was no time, according to Spicer. \u201cWhat happened if we didn't act and somebody was killed?\u201d he said. That rationale led to this exchange with New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters, who was on the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d panel:\n\nPETERS: Was there an imminent threat? I mean, that's what you seem to be implying. But there was no imminent threat. SPICER: No, no, no. But what I'm saying is, what I'm going to tell you is, if something had happened and your answer would have been, \u201cWell, if you guys had acted quicker, we could have saved that person.\u201d Too many of these cases that have happened \u2014 whether you're talking about San Bernardino, Atlanta \u2014 they've happened ... PETERS: Did you have information that something like that was going to happen? SPICER: Do you wait until you do? The answer is you act now to protect the future.\n\nBy Spicer's own admission, there was no ticking time bomb \u2014 none that Action Hero Trump knew about, anyway. But the White House's message seems to be that Americans should feel like a countdown clock is always approaching zero and that it is best to just start cutting wires. Right now.\n\nFrom a media relations standpoint, there is a real benefit to making people feel this way: Whenever reporters ask why the president took a certain action, Spicer's fallback response can be that someone could have died.\n\nFear is a powerful tool. And the White House is using it to try to avoid giving a real explanation for why this action was necessary.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/callum.borchers", "type": "article"}
