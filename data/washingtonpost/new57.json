The list includes all but one of the countries covered by the original ban plus three more: Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The restrictions on Venezuela apply to that country\u2019s leaders and their families.\n\nWhile the entire order is sure to be controversial, the timing of the North Korea addition is particularly sensitive because it comes amid a protracted standoff over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nSuccessive rounds of U.N. sanctions have done little to curb missile and nuclear tests, with the Kim regime pushing ahead and threatening, repeatedly, to target the United States.\n\nIn recent days, the situation has devolved into name-calling. Trump has tweeted vague threats to \u201cRocket Man\u201d Kim, and the North Korean dictator has fired back at \u201cdotard\u201d Trump.\n\nEveryday, North Koreans are told that the Americans are \"imperialists\" and North Korean children are taught that \"cunning American wolves\" want to kill them. To understand why, we need to go back to the Korean War. (Anna Fifield,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the context of this escalating conflict, the North Korea travel ban may appear to be part of a U.S. push to isolate the regime. But experts said the provisions are unlikely to do so \u2014 or, in fact, accomplish anything concrete at all.\n\nTrump pitched the new order as a measure designed to keep Americans safe. \u201cMaking America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe problem with punishing Pyongyang by stopping North Koreans from traveling to the United States is that very few \u2014 almost none \u2014 make the trip.\n\nThe new executive order suspends \u201cimmigrant and nonimmigrant\u201d travel from North Korea to the United States. But people cannot emigrate from North Korea to the United States to begin with.\n\n\u201cThey should have checked if there is North Korean immigration before they banned it,\u201d said John Delury, an associate professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University. \u201cWhy are you banning something that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\nNorth Korean defectors who end up in the United States usually arrive via South Korea and are typically traveling on South Korean, not North Korean, passports.\n\nAlthough North Korean diplomats do travel to the United States, mostly to United Nations headquarters in New York, the order notes that diplomatic visits are exempt from the ban.\n\nPassengers board an Air Koryo plane bound for Beijing at the Pyongyang International Airport in North Korea in June 2015.

The original travel ban was widely criticized for targeting Muslims \u2014 adding North Korea and Venezuela changes the conversation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no logic in the North Korea context, so we can conclude this is not really about North Korea,\u201d Delury said. \u201cThis is not part of real North Korea policy at all.\u201d\n\nAmber Ziye Wang and Shirley Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhite House expands travel ban, restricting visitors from eight countries\n\nTrump calls North Korea\u2019s leader \u2018madman\u2019 whose regime will face new tests\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "ban", "korean", "korea", "venezuela", "regime", "order", "united", "north", "states", "koreans"], "summary": "President Trump\u2019s extension of his travel ban to North Korea is mostly symbolic and will have little to no effect on Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, experts said Monday.\nEveryday, North Koreans are told that the Americans are \"imperialists\" and North Korean children are taught that \"cunning American wolves\" want to kill them.\n(Anna Fifield,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)In the context of this escalating conflict, the North Korea travel ban may appear to be part of a U.S. push to isolate the regime.\nThe original travel ban was widely criticized for targeting Muslims \u2014 adding North Korea and Venezuela changes the conversation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no logic in the North Korea context, so we can conclude this is not really about North Korea,\u201d Delury said."}
