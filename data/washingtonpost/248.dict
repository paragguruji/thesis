(Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post)\n\nINDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Leaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday expressed opposition to President Trump's ban on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, saying the executive order is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation, who is co-chairing a weekend conference of donors who help finance the Koch operation.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies.\u201d\n\nThe statement represents the network's first public critique of Trump since his election victory.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order to halt U.S. entry for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals for 120 days starting Jan. 27. Fiery protests and lawsuits made for a tumultuous weekend. Here's what you need to know. (Dalton Bennett,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Katherine Shaver,Monica Akhtar,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nLast year, Charles Koch, the conservative industrialist who leads the network, was sharply critical of Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants from the United States, calling the idea \u201cantithetical to our approach.\u201d He called the suggestion that Trump might require Muslims to register \u201creminiscent of Nazi Germany.\u201d\n\nKoch did not weigh in on the ban Saturday night as he greeted 550 wealthy donors gathered in a courtyard under stately palm trees at a desert resort here. The 81-year-old billionaire, who pointedly declined to endorse Trump in last year's presidential election, praised the network's work in helping Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate and their support for state officials around the country.\n\nHe expressed optimism about what the group will be able to accomplish in the coming year, saying, \u201cWe may not have an opportunity again like we have today.\u201d\n\n[Koch network to spend $300 million to $400 million on politics, policy in 2018 cycle]\n\nIn the 2018 cycle, the network aims to spend $300 million to $400 million on policy and political campaigns \u2014 up from $250 million during the 2016 elections. The money will be spread across a constellation of groups, including Americans for Prosperity (AFP), the Freedom Partners Action Fund, Concerned Veterans for America, the Libre Initiative and Generation Opportunity, which operate under the AFP banner.\n\nThis weekend's gathering is the largest since Koch began holding twice-a-year seminars with like-minded donors in 2003. Since then, he and his allies have built a political and policy operation with reach into 36 states.\n\nNo one from the Trump administration attended this weekend's conclave. However, five Republican senators made appearances: Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.), David Perdue (Ga.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Mike Lee (Utah) and James Lankford (Okla.). So are two House members, Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.). And three governors flew in: Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, Arizona\u2019s Doug Ducey and Illinois\u2019s Bruce Rauner.\n\n[Top Republicans raise concerns that ban could harm U.S. image]\n\nAsked by reporters Sunday whether he wanted to weigh in on Trump's refugee ban, Chaffetz quipped: \u201cNot really, but if you want me to, I will.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee expressed concerns about the specifics but said the move is generally on the right track.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re targeting based on religion, I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Chaffetz. \u201cI understand the need and support the idea that vetting from certain countries is needed. \u2026 A legal permanent resident I think is a different category. I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re trying to do on those categories. People that have a green card supposedly have been vetted. So there needs to be some further clarification.\u201d\n\nThe congressman withdrew his support for Trump in October after the revelation of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video in which Trump talked about women in lewd terms.\n\nBut on Sunday, Chaffetz praised Trump for governing as he campaigned. \u201cI support generally what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s off to a roaring start,\u201d said Chaffetz, who might try to run for Senate in 2018. \u201cI think he\u2019s surprising a lot of people that he\u2019s doing what he said he\u2019s going to do. But there are those of us that actually support that.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Lee ducked when asked by reporters about the executive order, saying he only wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, the subject of a panel Sunday morning\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to discuss a different issue and I\u2019ve got to leave right now to go catch a flight,\u201d he said.\n\nPressed by a group of reporters at the meeting, he added: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I\u2019d lose my First Amendment rights after walking out this door.\u201d\n\nThen Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, walked out the door.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/jhohmann", "type": "article"}
