(Ted Soqui/Reuters)\n\nPolling occupies a nifty space in the political consciousness. Polls that support people\u2019s political positions are often presented uncritically as evidence that the positions are correct. Polls that run contrary to those positions are lumped into the hazy \u201cpolls are unreliable\u201d criticism that\u2019s become increasingly prevalent over the past few years.\n\nThat prevalence stems in part from President Trump\u2019s embrace of the uncertainty of polls in the general election. During the primaries, when he consistently led, polls were correct and proved that his victory was inevitable. During the general, when he consistently trailed, polls were incorrect, skewed, fraudulent \u2014 and missed that his victory was inevitable. (In a weird twist of fate, the polls were both correct \u2014 Trump lost the popular vote by about the predicted margin \u2014 and missed his victory.)\n\nIn the wake of a weekend of protests over Trump\u2019s executive order blocking new refugees and halting migration from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa, the Trump administration has pointed to polling proving that the American public stands with it.\n\n\u201cA new Rasmussen Report poll finds that 57 percent, which is a clear majority, of likely U.S. voters, favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen,\u201d press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday, \u201cuntil the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat.\u201d That\u2019s true; you can see the poll here.\n\nSpicer also pointed to a poll from Reuters and its pollster, Ipsos. He highlighted a related detail, but the Reuters-Ipsos poll got a lot of press earlier this week for the results of a question similar to Rasmussen\u2019s. About half the country agreed with the president\u2019s policy \u2014 a plurality of respondents.\n\nBut wait! On Thursday, Gallup weighed in. According to its data, most Americans disagreed with the ban.\n\nSo that\u2019s three results: one strongly for, one about split, one strongly against. How\u2019s that possible?\n\nOne answer lies in the questions being asked.\n\nRasmussen asked whether people favored a temporary ban from seven countries until the government improves its screening for potential terrorists .\n\na ban from until the government its screening for . Reuters-Ipsos \u2014 after a battery of questions about immigration and refugees \u2014 asked whether people agreed or disagreed with an order signed by Trump blocking refugees and banning people from seven Muslim- majority countries.\n\nwith an order refugees and from seven countries. Gallup asked whether people approved of Trump ordering a temporary ban for most people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThose are very different phrasings, with Rasmussen\u2019s the most friendly. When Rasmussen asked a slightly different (and more accurate) version of that question later in the week, the response was less supportive.\n\n(It\u2019s also worth noting that Rasmussen typically generates poll results that are friendlier to Republicans than other pollsters.)\n\nPart of the problem is also that many poll respondents don\u2019t really have strong feelings about the intricacies of policy proposals \u2014 even proposals that have dominated the news for a week. How those ideas are presented may constitute most of the respondents\u2019 knowledge of the issue; how those questions are asked in relation to other questions can play a role, too. Mention a president who some people love and some people hate, and that shifts things further.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that there\u2019s a split in how Americans feel about Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Different parts of the order \u2014 assuring robust scrutiny of migrants\u2019 backgrounds \u2014 are certainly more popular than others, like barring children from entry simply because they were born in Iran.
