(Mike Blake / Reuters)\n\nUber became the center of a political battleground Saturday after hundreds of Twitter users rallied behind the #DeleteUber hashtag to protest the company\u2019s decision to continue operating while taxis decided to strike \u2014 refusing to pick up passengers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in opposition to President Trump\u2019s refugee ban.\n\nBy Sunday morning, rival Lyft had quickly seized on the issue, pledging to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully fought for a stay of the ban and secured the release of refugees who had been stranded in transit.\n\nLyft drivers also gave rides during the strike, but #DeleteUber began trending after Uber tweeted it was lifting surge pricing at JFK International Airport, where thousands had gathered to demonstrate against the ban.\n\n[Judge halts deportations as refugee ban causes worldwide furor]\n\nCustomers took it as evidence the company was trying to profit off of striking workers. Lyft had continued to operate as well but did not turn off its surge pricing, a company spokeswoman said; dozens of Uber customers said they would instead turn to that service.\n\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick is a member of President Trump\u2019s economic advisory group and has repeatedly pledged to work with the president to solve issues related to urban mobility, drawing the ire of activists who say such attitudes enable Trump\u2019s actions. Kalanick expressed concern with the ban in a memo to employees Saturday, saying it would affect \u201cmany innocent people,\u201d and that the company would explore how to compensate impacted employees for three months.\n\nThe order \u201caffects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family,\u201d Kalanick said. \u201cThat means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families\u2014and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time.\u201d\n\nKalanick said he planned to raise the issue with Trump at a Friday meeting of the advisory group.\n\nBut his explanation didn\u2019t satisfy many customers, who flooded Uber\u2019s site with complaints.\n\n\u201cYou work with Trump, I\u2019ll work with Lyft,\u201d read one complaint.\n\n\u201cYou collude with facists,\u201d read another.\n\nHours after sending the Tweet, Uber was forced to respond to their complaints.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry for any confusion about our earlier tweet\u2014it was not meant to break up any strike,\u201d read a statement from Uber. \u201cWe wanted people to know they could use Uber to get to and from JFK at normal prices, especially tonight.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators gathered at New York's JFK airport to protest against President Trump's executive order on refugees. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nThe New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents more than 19,000 workers, held the strike in solidarity with the demonstrations, citing its \u201clargely Muslim\u201d membership. The strike was planned to last from 6 to 7 p.m.; Uber\u2019s tweet went out about 30 minutes later.\n\n[Read the complaint]\n\n\u201cToday, drivers are joining the protest at JFK Airport in support of all those who are currently being detained at the airport because of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional executive order,\u201d read a statement from the union. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with all of our peace-loving neighbors against this inhumane, cruel, and unconstitutional pure act of bigotry.\u201d\n\nLyft\u2019s founders said in an email accompanying the announcement that the company fiercely opposes the ban and will stand up for its political values, announcing the donation of $1 million over four years.\n\n\u201cThis weekend, Trump closed the country\u2019s borders to refugees, immigrants, and even documented residents from around the world based on their country of origin,\u201d co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green said. \u201cBanning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U.S. is antithetical to both Lyft\u2018s and our nation\u2019s core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community.\u201d\n\n[Are you, or someone you know, affected by President Trump\u2019s travel restrictions?]\n\nAnother group, United for Equal Access New York, urged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to pull his support for a statewide expansion of Uber in light of its decision to continue service during the strike.\n\n\u201cWhen Gov. Cuomo stood against Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, Uber just saw another way to profit,\u201d founder Dustin Jones said. \u201cAny company that chooses to profit off Trump\u2019s un-American decrees is not worthy of operating in New York State.\u201d\n\nFollowing Lyft\u2019s announcement of a contribution to the ACLU, Uber said Sunday it would establish a $3 million fund to assist drivers affected by the refugee ban. Kalanick announced the fund in a Facebook post, where he decried what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cwrong and unjust immigration ban,\u201d a day after customers began fleeing with the hashtag #DeleteUber.\n\nKalanick reiterated a commitment to cover drivers\u2019 lost earnings while they are barred from entering the country, but did not walk back his pledge to work with the Trump administration \u2014 as the disgruntled customers sought.\n\n(Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is an investor in Uber.)\n\nCorrection: Lyft did not turn off its surge pricing at JFK Airport Saturday, as this post previously said.
