Chanting in the streets, accusations of fascism, profane grousing on Facebook and Twitter; the word \u201cresistance,\u201d mostly inactive since the 1960s and 1970s, has suddenly sprung to life.\n\nMaybe we should be heartened, as former president Barack Obama says, \u201cby the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country.\u201d But there\u2019s something unreflective about all this engagement, and that\u2019s true even if it\u2019s as rooted in sound morality as the demonstrators believe. When you\u2019re demonstrating, you\u2019ve already decided what\u2019s virtuous and what\u2019s evil. Most of President Trump\u2019s despisers have made their decision. He has earned their ire, and they\u2019re going to give it to him.\n\nThe chief occasion for all this unrest, of course, is the president\u2019s executive order on visas. The order places a 90-day ban on entry from countries named in a 2015 law that imposed stricter standards of entry on people coming from Iran and six other countries where Islamic radicals have a large and threatening presence, and it bars refugees from any country for 120 days. The response was instant and explosive \u2014 placard-waving protests at airports and other public venues, innumerable commentaries denouncing the \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d news reports clearly premised on the belief that the ban is immoral and probably illegal, suggestions on social media that Trump didn\u2019t target countries where his company has financial interests, and on and on. There were clear grounds for believing the order had been stupidly implemented \u2014 the lack of any warning, the fact that permanent residents were swept up into the ban \u2014 but the white-hot emotions animating the protests went far beyond arguments over process.\n\nAmid all the bedlam, one quiet story in the New York Times caught my attention. \u201cIn ban on migrants,\u201d the headline announced, \u201cTrump supporters see a promise kept.\u201d The president\u2019s policy may be causing protests around the country and \u201craising eyebrows\u201d abroad, the Times report says. \u201cBut at home, a large portion of the electorate is behind the president.\u201d\n\nUh-oh. If that\u2019s true, one of two things is also true. Either we live in a nation of unbending xenophobes, or the president\u2019s placard-waving detractors have missed something important about the nation in which they live \u2014 something far more important than any executive order or immigration policy.\n\nThe Times story went on to interview some of these Trump supporters. A gay hotel worker in Staten Island says he\u2019s happy about the ban. He references the 49 people killed at an Orlando nightclub. \u201cThat one really got to me,\u201d he says. An owner of a home alarm company in Seattle doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to wonder who we\u2019re letting in. \u201cIt is not irrational that people are worried. . . . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to re-examine what we are doing.\u201d An insurance salesman in Boston remembers the Tsarnaev brothers. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Never forget\u2019 and \u2018Boston strong,\u2019 and the only one that I see being Boston strong is President Trump.\u201d\n\nTheir fears, as the Times report suggests, may be groundless. Since 9/11, as has been pointed out many times over the past week, no American has been killed in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil by an immigrant, or even the son or daughter of an immigrant, from any of the seven countries listed in the executive order. That\u2019s true, but (a) it\u2019s the sort of argument that implicitly concedes the propriety of some visa bans in some circumstances, and (b) it\u2019s not by itself a reason to regard Trump\u2019s executive order as wrong or irrational. National security policies such as this one aren\u2019t prompted by statistical analysis of past events \u2014 at least one hopes they aren\u2019t \u2014 but by current realities and prognostications based on them. The fact that no Islamist Yemeni has set off a bomb in an American city is not by itself an argument for continuing to allow Yemeni asylum seekers into the United States.\n\nMany Americans, though, are guided by a simpler and more cogent logic than what animates policy debates in Washington and New York. It goes something like this: Islamist-inspired terrorism has taken many lives around the globe, especially, though not exclusively, in the Middle East and North Africa. The federal government allows many people from the Middle East and North Africa to enter the United States. It stands to reason that, if our immigration policy continues unchecked, the violence racking Syria, Somalia, Libya, et al., will in some measure show up here, too.\n\nI don\u2019t share that belief. But it is not an irrational one, and it is conceivable that I am wrong. Nor is support of the visa ban evidence of bigotry or coldhearted xenophobia. It is merely to value the safety of neighbors and countrymen whom one knows over the safety of foreigners whom one doesn\u2019t \u2014 not an obviously malign preference. And it has the merit of reassuring ordinary Americans that, even if federal policy gets it wrong or goes too far, their government is at least trying to perform its most basic function. I\u2019m not sure Trump\u2019s adversaries can achieve their aims by telling such people they\u2019re idiots and bigots.\n\nThe resisters had better pause for long enough to ask why anybody would approve of what Trump is doing. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, they\u2019ll find themselves resisting for eight years and not just four.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
