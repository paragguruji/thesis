(Reuters)\n\nA panel of United Nations human rights experts said Wednesday that President Trump\u2019s sweeping order restricting some travelers and refugees from entering the United States violates the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\n\nThe blunt assessment from the U.N. is the latest criticism it has volleyed at Trump\u2019s ban, which temporarily closes America\u2019s borders to people from seven Muslim-majority nations and suspends admission for almost all refugees for a 120-day period.\n\n\u201cSuch an order is clearly discriminatory based on one\u2019s nationality and leads to increased stigmatization of Muslim communities,\u201d a group of U.N. Special Rapporteurs \u2014 experts appointed to study human rights issues \u2014 said in a statement. The group includes rapporteurs on migrants, human rights and counterterrorism, racism, torture and freedom of religion.\n\nTrump and officials in his administration have argued since he signed the order last Friday that the measure is not a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d During the presidential campaign, Trump called for a Muslim ban, a statement that remains on his campaign website, and he said the day he signed the order that he would prioritize Christians seeking admission as refugees.\n\n[\u2018These are people\u2019s lives they are playing with\u2019: World\u2019s airports turn into limbo for many under Trump order]\n\nIn its statement, the group of U.N. experts alluded to people who have been detained at airports across the country, saying they were worried people flying to the United States \u201cwill be subject to detention for an undefined period of time and then ultimately deported.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the United States mission to the U.N. did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nU.N. officials have spoken out against the ban in very sharp terms this week, worrying about its impact on refugees and expressing concerns it could help terrorist groups. Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, called the travel ban \u201cmean-spirited\u201d on Monday, while U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres released a statement a day later saying he was worried about decisions \u201cundermining the integrity of the international refugee protection regime.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order to halt U.S. entry for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals for 120 days starting Jan. 27.

It also significantly cut back the number of refugees the United States will take in and, in addition to a 120-day freeze on most refugee admissions, indefinitely suspended the arrival of any Syrian refugees.\n\nThe U.N. has called the situation in Syria \u201cthe worst war, the worst humanitarian crisis, the worst displacement crisis, the worst refugee crisis in a generation,\u201d and the experts Wednesday called Trump\u2019s order \u201ca significant setback for those who are obviously in need of international protection.\u201d\n\n[As Trump bars Syrian refugees, life in their camps is getting harder]\n\nThey also expressed their concerns about what would happen to refugees left in limbo, referring to \u201cnon-refoulement,\u201d a principle the U.N. has long held stating that nations cannot expel or return a refugee to an area where their life or freedom are threatened.\n\nThe experts wrote that the immigration policy \u201crisks people being returned, without proper individual assessments and asylum procedures, to places in which they risk being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in direct contravention of international humanitarian and human rights laws which uphold the principle of non-refoulement.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration said Tuesday that 872 refugees considered in transit and who would face \u201cundue hardship\u201d if turned back would be allowed into the United States by week\u2019s end. The U.N. refugee agency, in a statement this week, said that Trump\u2019s order could impact a far larger number of people, estimating that some 20,000 refugees might have been resettled in the United States during the 120-day window when most won\u2019t be allowed to enter the country.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTrump\u2019s refugee ban is a matter of life and death for some, including a 1-year-old with cancer\n\nOfficials worry that U.S. counterterrorism defenses will be weakened by Trump actions\n\nTrump has fired the acting attorney general who ordered Justice Dept. not to defend president\u2019s travel ban\n\nHundreds of lawyers descend on airports to offer free help after Trump\u2019s executive order\n\nTrump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["trump", "ban", "immigration", "refugee", "refugees", "united", "states", "trumps", "rights", "experts", "violates", "order", "obligations", "human", "say"], "summary": "White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the actions that led to a 5-year-old boy being detained at a U.S. airport for hours following President Trump's immigration ban.\n(Reuters)A panel of United Nations human rights experts said Wednesday that President Trump\u2019s sweeping order restricting some travelers and refugees from entering the United States violates the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\n\u201cSuch an order is clearly discriminatory based on one\u2019s nationality and leads to increased stigmatization of Muslim communities,\u201d a group of U.N.
