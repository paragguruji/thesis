On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) fought back tears as he announced that Democrats would introduce legislation to stop the order.\n\n\u201cThis executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\u201d he said, flanked by refugees at a news conference in New York. \u201cLook at these faces! Are they any kind of threat to America? No, they\u2019re the promise of America.\u201d\n\nSchumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump\u2019s travel ban. And in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump\u2019s order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support that overturns the ban,\u201d Murphy said. \u201c[The president] clearly campaigned on this ban, but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nGiven that stance, Murphy said, Democrats must \u201cforce a debate\u201d this week on Trump\u2019s order by slowing consideration of the president\u2019s remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, his choice to serve as the next secretary of state.\n\n\u201cWe should take every ounce of time that we\u2019re allowed on these nominees to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration, especially when it comes to foreign policy,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer and Democrats are eager to move quickly because they believe they have a rare opportunity to ride a wave of GOP opposition to Trump\u2019s moves. Democrats argue that one of the only ways they can influence policymaking in the next two years is to drive a wedge between Trump and members of his own party.\n\n[McConnell: We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country]\n\nAt his news conference, Schumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.).\n\nDetails of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants\u2019 rights issues, aides said. Schumer was working to coordinate the proposals Sunday; Murphy said he received a call from the leader early in the day to confer.\n\nDemocratic leaders also were exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump\u2019s orders \u2014 with the party seeking once again to tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets.\n\n(Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has taken a leading role in Democratic messaging, said Sunday that the Senate needs \u201cto pass legislation immediately which effectively rescinds Trump\u2019s un-American and unconstitutional ban on people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States.\u201d He also argued for slowing the nomination process.\n\n\u201cAlmost without exception, Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees are extremely controversial and way outside of the American mainstream,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn my view, the Senate needs to take as much time as possible on the floor for a full discussion and debate about each of these nominees.\u201d\n\nFor the party\u2019s restive base, that fight \u2014 just 10 days into the new president\u2019s term \u2014 could not come soon enough. While Democrats have embraced the protests against Trump and Republican policies, and while some helped organize more than 70 rallies on Jan. 15 against repealing the Affordable Care Act, progressives have criticized the party for not voting en masse against Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks.\n\n\u201cYou better show up ready to do real work on Monday after all this pro bono work we, the people, did for you on our day off,\u201d said CNN host W. Kamau Bell in a Saturday night tweet.\n\nIn several cases, Democratic lawmakers took one of the most basic steps available to them as members of Congress: They provided services for constituents. New York Democratic Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo upon U.S. arrival.\n\nIn Houston, where the candidates for DNC roles participated in the second of four \u201cfuture forums,\u201d activists filled a ballroom at Texas Southern University to ask why Democrats were not doing more. One attendee could be heard shouting, \u201cElizabeth Warren sold us out,\u201d a reference to her committee vote in favor of Ben Carson\u2019s nomination to become secretary of housing and urban development .\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, before the protests had gotten fully underway, some of the Houston event\u2019s biggest cheers came when the candidates were asked whether they would oppose all of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 something no Democrat has done.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen in the last seven days, I think we may be underreacting,\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said.\n\n[The tumultuous politics of U.S. immigration policy]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got refugees who were vetted more than the Trump Cabinet was vetted,\u201d said former labor secretary Thomas Perez.\n\nRep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim member of Congress, said that the party needs to follow the lead of activists and that those activists are needed for direct action against Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is street action that creates the economic and social conditions for legislation to get passed,\u201d Ellison said.\n\nAfter the forum, Buttigieg joined Perez and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison at the protests breaking out at Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.\n\n\u201cWe knew this would be a day of reckoning when Donald Trump assumed the Oval Office,\u201d Perez said to protesters. \u201cLady Liberty has taken a few body punches, but the American people will fight back.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday night, many more elected Democrats were joining protests \u2014 and enabling them. After the Port Authority suspended the AirTrain that transports people from New York\u2019s subway to JFK Airport, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) reversed its decision. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) showed up at Philadelphia\u2019s airport in a tuxedo, having left a formal event to help local elected officials negotiate with customs officers to see stranded immigrants and refugees.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) did the same \u2014 to little avail. At Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a speech against Trump\u2019s order that was amplified by the crowd, a \u201cpeople\u2019s microphone\u201d that had been used by the Occupy Wall Street movement. And Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) joined marchers protesting Trump\u2019s travel ban outside the White House on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBooker, Harris and Warren, considered possible Democratic presidential contenders in 2020, cast three of just 11 \u201cno\u201d votes against Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Murphy noted that the Senate quickly confirmed James Mattis, the revered former Marine general, to serve as defense secretary \u201cbecause he assured us that he was going to argue against the very ban he watched Trump sign.\u201d At a summer 2016 roundtable, Mattis said the idea of a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d would make actors in the Middle East think America had \u201ccompletely lost it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of us gave the president and his Cabinet a little benefit of the doubt last week,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any reason that that should continue. Almost every single one of these nominees try to prop up their nomination by contradicting Trump in their confirmation hearing. It\u2019s pretty clear now that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are running this administration and the nominees that have been confirmed thus far have been marginalized.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, nearly every congressional Democrat had condemned the executive order, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who faces a 2018 reelection campaign in a state Trump carried by 35 points. None defended it, but several remained silent. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned that Democrats can only do so much to try to stop Trump, given their diminished powers on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to pick our battles in the next two years because we don\u2019t have the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many moving parts here, and we need to prioritize what we respond to and what we propound. We have to be proactively propounding an alternative vision that recalls American core values.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a longtime advocate for immigrant and refugee rights, is set to introduce a bill this week that would block implementation of Trump\u2019s order, according to senior House aides. And Pelosi informed colleagues Sunday afternoon that among the options her caucus would consider is the filing of a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the American Civil Liberties Union should legal cases to block or reverse Trump\u2019s travel ban reach the Supreme Court.\n\nConnolly said he and many other Democrats have been stunned by how organically Americans have been drawn into the streets to protest Trump\u2019s early decisions as president. Just days after the Jan. 21 Women\u2019s March on Washington, 200 more people than usual showed up at a regular meeting of the Fairfax County Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are all kinds of people networking and asking the question, \u2018What can I do?\u2019 There\u2019s not a sense of \u2018Throw up your hands, our fate is sealed.\u2019 It\u2019s quite the opposite. It wasn\u2019t a feckless, powerless act. It was a call to arms. And I believe it\u2019s going to lead to mass organizing across the country to resist this constitutional assault.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "type": "article"}
