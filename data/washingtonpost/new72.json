(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nJust hours before President Trump\u2019s second travel ban is set to go into effect, Justice Department lawyers headed to court to fight attempts to halt the executive order.\n\nA key part of the Trump administration\u2019s argument for why this ban is both necessary and different from the last one: This time, top national security officials asked Trump for the order.\n\nIn a letter written to Trump and dated March 6, the day the president signed the revised travel ban, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly argued that the new order is needed to help address \u201ca risk to our nation\u2019s security.\u201d The letter appeared to highlight a key difference between Trump\u2019s earlier ban \u2014 which was signed in late January, met by intense protests and then quickly frozen by the courts \u2014 and his second order, which laid out more national security-related justifications for why it is necessary.\n\n[Trump\u2019s new entry ban challenged in courts hours before it takes effect]\n\nThe first ban remained suspended after a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously rejected the Trump administration\u2019s argument that the suspension should be lifted for national security reasons. In their opinion, the judges noted that the government had not provided \u201cany evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns\u201d justified temporarily barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier halt on President Trump's second attempt at a travel ban on May 25, as another court battle continues to play out over the ban in the 9th Circuit. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nUnder the new ban, which would block the issuance of new visas to citizens from six countries from traveling to the United States after Iraq was dropped from the list, the government delves into more detail to back up its decision, as well as another to temporarily block refugees from entering the country.\n\nMuch of that argument is echoed in the letter Sessions and Kelly wrote, which was included among court filings Monday submitted by Justice Department officials seeking to defend the new ban against a lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii. In its own filings, Hawaii asked a federal judge to block the new order, which they described as tantamount to a Muslim ban and, therefore, unconstitutional.\n\nThe nations affected by President Trump's executive action on immigration are not actually countries where terrorists who have carried out fatal attacks the United States came from. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nThe letter from Sessions and Kelly, which was also cited in other governmental filings as part of an overall defense of the order, lends their support for the new ban by requesting \u201ca temporary pause on the entry of nationals from certain countries\u201d \u2014 specifically, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThey illustrate this need by invoking the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and warning that \u201cforeign nationals\u201d could enter the country as refugees and \u201ccommit acts of terrorism,\u201d saying it would be a mammoth undertaking to determine who has entered the country and become a danger.\n\n\u201cPreventing and responding to terrorism at home encompasses thousands of national security personnel across the federal government \u2014 in effect, we admit individuals at risk for terrorism and then try to identify and stop them from carrying out their terrorist activities,\u201d Sessions and Kelly wrote. \u201cThis places unacceptable stress on our law enforcement resources, which could be better spent on other efforts to weaken those terrorist organizations, protect the homeland, and safeguard our national security.\u201d\n\nThe revised order says that \u201cheightened concerns about terrorism\u201d warranted barring people from the six countries listed. Yet the new ban, much like the old one, would not have kept out anyone responsible for any deadly U.S. terrorist attack since 2001. Every deadly jihadist attack inside the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, has been carried out by a U.S. citizen or legal resident, according to data collected by New America, a Washington-based nonprofit group.\n\n[Trump\u2019s new travel ban still wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly U.S. terror attacks]\n\nThis is also something the three-judge appellate panel noted last month, writing that the Trump administration provided \u201cno evidence\u201d that anyone from a banned country \u201cperpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 cited by Sessions and Kelly in their letter \u2014 were carried out by hijackers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. Other attacks that Trump cited days before he signed the new ban \u2014 the Boston Marathon bombing and the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage \u2014 also were not carried out by people from countries affected by the ban. (The Department of Homeland Security, in a report assessing the terror threat posed by people from the seven countries covered by the first order, said citizenship is an \u201cunreliable\u201d indicator of terrorism.)\n\nIn revising its ban, the Trump administration has shifted gears, pointing not to deadly attacks but instead to cases they say involved people investigated for or convicted of terrorism-related cases. These cases, they say, argue in particular for a temporary halt in refugee admissions.\n\n\u201cAt present, more than 300 persons who came to the United States as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,\u201d Sessions and Kelly wrote, mentioning that some drew inspiration from the Islamic State. \u201cThere are currently approximately 1,000 pending domestic terrorism-related investigations, and it is believed that a majority of those subjects are inspired, at least in part, by ISIS.\u201d\n\n[Why Hawaii says Trump\u2019s new travel ban is still unconstitutional]\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has declined to provide any context or explanation for these figures, including what countries the \u201cmore than 300\u201d refugees came from and their current citizenship statuses.\n\nThe \u201cmore than 300\u201d refugees figure may seem large, but dating back to the Refugee Act of 1980, about 3 million refugees have resettled in the United States. As my colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted, since Sept. 11, 2001, about 190,000 refugees have come to the United States from the six banned countries.\n\nIt is also not known whether the Trump administration believes any of these people were radicalized in the United States long after entering the country. A Trump administration official speaking under the condition of anonymity at a background briefing suggested that at least some of these people \u201cinfiltrated with hostile intent.\u201d But without further details, it is impossible to know if this is accurate.\n\nAn FBI spokesman referred questions about the \u201cmore than 300\u201d figure to the Justice Department, which has declined to comment beyond the court filings because \u201cthe matter is subject of active litigation.\u201d\n\nSome other numbers involving refugees are known. Refugees from the six countries targeted in the revised travel ban have been responsible for no successful attacks in the United States between 1975 and 2015, according to a report published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. In November, a year after that report came out, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a refugee from Somalia, drove his car into a crowd on the Ohio State University campus, injuring 11 people. The only person killed during the incident was Artan, who was shot by a university police officer within a minute of the attack.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe full text of Trump\u2019s revised executive order\n\nSessions and Kelly\u2019s letter requesting the new ban\n\nJustice Dept. lays out defense of revised travel ban as key court hearings loom\n\nTrump\u2019s new travel ban raises the same Silicon Valley objections", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "national", "ban", "security", "administrations", "refugees", "officials", "united", "states", "sessions", "countries", "asked", "kelly", "rationale", "latest"], "summary": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, left, and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced the new travel ban this month.\n(Susan Walsh/AP)Just hours before President Trump\u2019s second travel ban is set to go into effect, Justice Department lawyers headed to court to fight attempts to halt the executive order.\nA key part of the Trump administration\u2019s argument for why this ban is both necessary and different from the last one: This time, top national security officials asked Trump for the order.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an earlier halt on President Trump's second attempt at a travel ban on May 25, as another court battle continues to play out over the ban in the 9th Circuit.\nlays out defense of revised travel ban as key court hearings loomTrump\u2019s new travel ban raises the same Silicon Valley objections"}
