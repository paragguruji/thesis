Attorney general vows Supreme Court appeal.]\n\nPresident Trump posted tweets defending his travel ban and saying that he thinks even harsher measures might be necessary for U.S. security. (Mike Theiler/Reuters)\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets could significantly damage his administration\u2019s effort to restore the ban, which has been put on hold by two federal courts.\n\nNext week, those suing are expected to file arguments on the matter with the Supreme Court, and Trump\u2019s latest remarks will surely be part of their briefs. The administration appealed to the nation\u2019s highest court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month.\n\nNeal Katyal, the lawyer who argued for the challengers in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, wrote on Twitter, \u201cIts kinda odd to have the defendant in HawaiivTrump acting as our co-counsel. We don\u2019t need the help but will take it!\u201d He also wrote that he was \u201cwaiting now for the inevitable cover-my-tweet posts from him that the Solicitor General will no doubt insist upon.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven George Conway, a prominent lawyer who recently took himself out of the running to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division and who is the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, posted on Twitter that the remarks might hurt the legal case.\n\n\u201cThese tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,\u201d he wrote, using abbreviations for Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court.\n\n[Conway: President\u2019s tweets \u2018certainly won\u2019t help\u2019]\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned that his tweets might muddy the legal case, and his attention was instead on the substance of his executive order. She said she was not aware of any vetting of his tweets by lawyers or aides.\n\nView Graphic How Trump\u2019s travel ban broke from the normal executive order process\n\n\u201cThe president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that\u2019s protecting Americans, protecting national security, and he has every constitutional authority to do that through that executive order and he maintains that, and that position hasn\u2019t changed in the slightest,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nTrump himself indicated late in the day that he had no intention of backing down from his early morning sentiments, tweeting, \u201cThat\u2019s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won\u2019t help us protect our people!\u201d\n\nFederal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump\u2019s own comments in ordering that the ban be frozen, determining that the president\u2019s words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises]\n\nThe majority opinion in the 4th Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump\u2019s tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nOmar C. Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case in the 4th Circuit, wrote that Trump\u2019s tweets amounted to \u201ca promise: let me do this and I\u2019ll take it as license to do even worse.\u201d In an interview, Jadwat said the president\u2019s tweets \u201cseem to undermine the picture the government\u2019s been trying to paint.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure what our brief is going to look like, but this stuff seems relevant,\u201d Jadwat said.\n\nGovernment lawyers have sought to convince judges that they should not consider the president\u2019s statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban. They have also sought to portray the president\u2019s words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question \u2014 though not all \u2014 came before Trump was elected.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u201d acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest tweets \u2014 which were later set to dramatic music and posted in a video on his Facebook page \u2014 will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump\u2019s revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version.\n\nThat version, which unilaterally revoked the visas of tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim-majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was more onerous and had a provision in the text that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \u201cshould have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\u201d to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court.\n\nTrump also wrote that the Justice Department \u201cshould ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2014 & seek much tougher version!\u201d The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; the justices will be weighing whether Trump\u2019s order is constitutional.\n\nThe travel ban seems to have been on Trump\u2019s mind since the terrorist attack in London on Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\n[Trump ramps up push for travel ban even as opposition hardens]\n\nLegal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case.\n\n\u201cIn case it\u2019s not obvious, these will only undermine the government\u2019s case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\u201d University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \u201cThese will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\u201d\n\nTrump also wrote on Twitter that the administration was already \u201cEXTREME VETTING\u201d travelers coming into the United States \u2014 which he said was necessary to keep the country safe because courts are \u201cslow and political!\u201d The Department of Homeland Security has previously suggested such vetting was taking place, but that, too, seems to undercut the Justice Department\u2019s legal position.\n\nThe travel ban was supposed to be a temporary measure, designed to afford the administration time to conduct a review and decide what new vetting procedures were necessary. When a federal judge in Hawaii ordered the ban frozen, though, the government interpreted his order as stopping even that review \u2014 and the judge declined to clarify that it did not.\n\nWall told the 4th Circuit last month that the administration had \u201cput our pens down\u201d and had \u201cdone nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u201d\n\nIf the administration already has implemented new vetting procedures, that would seem to call into question the necessity of a temporary ban. Legal analysts, though, have previously said that president\u2019s remarks indicate he might not view the measure as temporary \u2014 despite what the text of the executive order says.\n\nRead more:\n\nGraphic: What Trump changed in the new travel ban\n\nTrump was terrorized by the London attack, while Britain stood firm", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "hurt", "wrote", "tweets", "trump", "ban", "vetting", "court", "order", "trumps", "restore", "justice", "latest", "probably", "effort"], "summary": "\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump wrote.\n[Federal appeals court maintains freeze of Trump\u2019s travel ban.\nPresident Trump posted tweets defending his travel ban and saying that he thinks even harsher measures might be necessary for U.S. security.\n[President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises]The majority opinion in the 4th Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump\u2019s tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers.\nWe need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d[Trump ramps up push for travel ban even as opposition hardens]Legal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case."}
