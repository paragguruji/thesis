On Twitter, he added: \u201cMaking America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s original travel ban, signed as an executive order in the first days of his presidency, was always meant to be a temporary measure while his administration crafted more permanent rules. A senior administration official cautioned that the new restrictions are not meant to last forever, but are \u201cnecessary and conditions-based, not time-based.\u2019\u2019\n\nThree nations were added to the list of countries whose citizens will face the restrictions: Chad, North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 although the restrictions on Venezuela are narrowly crafted, targeting that country\u2019s leaders and their family members.\n\nOne country, Sudan, fell off the travel ban list issued at the beginning of the year. Senior administration officials said a review of Sudan\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. government on national security and information-sharing showed it was appropriate to remove it from the list.\n\nThe new restrictions will be phased in over time, officials said, and the restrictions will not affect anyone who already holds a U.S. visa. For those visitors affected by the changed restrictions, the new rules will go into effect Oct. 18, according to the proclamation.\n\nBoth of Trump\u2019s orders have been blocked by judges, but the Supreme Court in June allowed it to go into effect with a significant caveat. The administration, the court said, could not block from entering the country those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as family members or those with firm offers of employment.\n\nThe ban on citizens of the six countries was to last 90 days; the ban on refugees was to last 120 days. The refu\u00adgee ban is set to expire Oct. 24, and it was not immediately clear what impact the new restrictions might have on it.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "type": "article"}
