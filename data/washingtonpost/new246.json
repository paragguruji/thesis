Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee pushed back Tuesday on a news report suggesting that members of his staff went behind his back to work on President Trump\u2019s executive order issued Friday barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe Monday evening report in Politico said that senior committee staff members \u201chelped Donald Trump\u2019s top aides draft the executive order\u201d and signed a nondisclosure agreement that would prevent them from sharing their work with members of Congress or colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut in remarks to fellow lawmakers and a press statement issued Tuesday morning, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said the staffers had his blessing to work on the Trump transition effort, much as congressional staffers of both parties have assisted this transition and previous transitions.\n\nGoodlatte said in the statement said the staffers are \u201csome of the best on Capitol Hill\u201d and are \u201cexperts in their respective fields.\u201d\n\n\u201cI proudly allowed them to provide their expertise to the Trump transition team on immigration law,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be clear, while they gave advice to the new Administration, they did not have decision making authority on the policy. The final decision was made at the highest levels of the Trump Administration, and I support the President\u2019s executive order. My staff had no control of the language contained in the President\u2019s executive order, the timing of the announcement, the rollout and subsequent implementation, and the coordination with Congress.\u201d\n\nInside the private House GOP conference meeting, Goodlatte made a similar statement, according to multiple people present, acknowledging that staff had assisted the Trump campaign and transition going back well into 2016 in adherence with ethics rules. According to the people present, Goodlatte did not leave his colleagues with the impression that the staffers had done anything wrong.\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s statement did not mention nondisclosure agreements, and a committee spokeswoman did not confirm they existed or answer questions about whether Goodlatte knew about them if they did. Media outlets, including The Washington Post, reported throughout the campaign and transition on Trump\u2019s insistence on making employees and advisers sign such agreements as a matter of course. It would be unusual for a congressional staffer to sign a nondisclosure agreement under those circumstances, said aides asked about the possible arrangement, but would not necessarily break any laws or congressional rules.\n\nWhat is not unusual is the practice of congressional aides members advising a presidential transition. The practice is routine enough that the House Ethics Committee issued guidance last year, as it has done during previous transitions, for staff members who wish to participate. The Ethics Committee memo lays out three options for staffers: provide assistance as a congressional aide, serve a \u201creimbursed detailee\u201d to the transition or take vacation or unpaid leave to serve as a volunteer.\n\nThe committee spokeswoman, Kathryn Rexrode, did not respond to questions about how the staffers in question handled their transition service.\n\nGoodlatte\u2019s aides were not the only staffers to have advised the Trump transition on immigration matters.\n\nAt least one Senate Judiciary Committee staff member was also involved as a \u201clegislative coordinator,\u201d according to a Senate GOP aide. That aide was part of a team \u201cinvolved in the drafting\u201d of immigration policy but was not involved in writing the final order issued Friday. The Senate aide added that, \u201cwhile there was knowledge that an order was being worked on, no details were shared with the committee prior to it being released.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "control", "ban", "goodlatte", "congressional", "statement", "members", "transition", "committee", "chairman", "staff", "order", "house", "staffers", "language", "judiciary"], "summary": "Rep.
