Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) said, \"keeping four-month-old babies out of our country does not make us safer.\" (Reuters)\n\nAs Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) prepared to address her colleagues Friday morning in the House of Representatives, another woman adjusted a nearby easel with a large photograph of a wide-eyed baby girl.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, this is Fatemeh,\u201d Bonamici said. \u201cShe is not a terrorist.\u201d\n\nShe explained the baby\u2019s predicament: Fatemeh was a 4-month-old infant from Iran in \u201cimmediate need\u201d of open-heart surgery. She had been diagnosed several weeks ago with structural abnormalities and two holes in her heart, and she would die unless she received treatment that Iranian hospitals were not equipped to provide, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cHer parents desperately want the best care for her, so they planned to bring her from their home in Iran to Portland, Ore., to one of the best hospitals for pediatric heart surgery,\u201d Bonamici said. \u201cThat\u2019s where Fatemeh\u2019s uncle and grandparents all live. They are U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nHowever, the family soon found their plans in turmoil after President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning travelers and revoking visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran.\n\n[Justice Dept. lawyer says 100,000 visas revoked under travel ban; State Dept. says about 60,000]\n\nTrump signed orders on Jan. 27 not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 would be suspended for 90 days.\n\nFatemeh\u2019s family had an appointment in Dubai to obtain a tourist visa to the United States, but it was abruptly canceled after Trump\u2019s order, according to the AP. They were told they could reapply in 90 days.\n\n\u201cBut Fatemeh\u2019s family does not know if she can wait that long,\u201d Bonamici said Friday on the House floor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the president had in mind when he signed that order, but it probably wasn\u2019t baby Fatemeh. Keeping 4-month-old babies out of our country doesn\u2019t make us safer. It puts her life in danger and diminishes the United States in the eyes of the world.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely devastating story of an Iranian baby denied life-saving heart surgery at @OHSUNews due to #MuslimBan. This ban has got to go. https://t.co/Cxve81TZPb \u2014 Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 2, 2017\n\nThe family\u2019s life-or-death situation had caught the attention of a group of lawmakers in Oregon, including Bonamici.\n\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking and disgraceful that this even happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the courts invalidate this unconstitutional Executive Order soon, and I hope it\u2019s in time for baby Fatemeh.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, several of those lawmakers filed for a waiver from the State Department and Homeland Security, the Oregonian reported.\n\n\u201cWhether [Fatemeh] and her family are allowed access to this urgent and necessary medical care in the United States will determine whether she lives or dies,\u201d the lawmakers said, according to the newspaper. \u201cGranting her family\u2019s request to travel to the U.S. is not only the moral and humanitarian decision, but would signal to Iran and the rest of the world that, even in the face of highly strained diplomatic relations, the United States offers help to those suffering tragic circumstances.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told the Oregonian he couldn\u2019t fathom a waiver wouldn\u2019t be granted when \u201ca little girl\u2019s life is at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conversation in Washington, D.C., is about national security,\u201d Merkley said, according to the newspaper. \u201cThe reality is that there are thousands of other people whose lives are being disrupted in similar ways.\u201d\n\nLate Friday night, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo released a statement indicating the baby and her family had been cleared for travel to the United States.\n\nThe right thing happened tonight: the federal gov granted Fatemeh Reshad & her family documents to come to the US. https://t.co/RqXRoooCTe \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) February 4, 2017\n\n\u201cThis evening we were pleased to learn that the federal government has now granted Fatemeh Reshad and her family boarding documents to come to the United States,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work with the International Refugee Assistance Project and their partners to ensure this baby receives the treatment she needs, and fight for those being unfairly shut out of America\u2019s gates by this policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right thing happened tonight,\u201d Cuomo tweeted Friday.\n\n[Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says]\n\nThe statement added the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison would pay for the family\u2019s travel costs. Mount Sinai Hospital also offered to provide the surgery free, but attorneys told the Oregonian the family would still seek to have the baby treated at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital in Portland, as planned.\n\nJennifer Morrissey, a Portland immigration lawyer, told the newspaper she spoke with the infant\u2019s uncle, Portland resident Samad Taghizadeh, on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI would describe him as extremely overwhelmed and grateful,\u201d she told the Oregonian.\n\nOn Friday night, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Washington state issued a ruling that would temporarily block enforcement of Trump\u2019s controversial ban. The following day, the State Department said it would reverse the revocation of visas under Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing previously banned travelers to enter the United States.\n\nPhysicians in Portland said, Feb. 4, that they will perform heart surgery on a 4-month-old Iranian baby, Fatemeh Reshad, whose arrival in the U.S. for treatment has been delayed by President Trump's travel ban. (Reuters)\n\nFatemeh had been born with a rare and complex form of congenital heart disease that affects about 2 in 10,000 newborns, said Dr. Laurie Armsby, a pediatric cardiologist at Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital, which is affiliated with OHSU.\n\n\u201cThis is a fatal condition without treatment,\u201d she said at a press conference Saturday, describing Fatemeh\u2019s abnormal blood circulation as a result of her condition. \u201cThe timing of death is different in every child. This is not a circulation that is compatible with life over a long period of time.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, a child with a similar condition would have been diagnosed and treated within the first week of life, then discharged from the hospital within a few weeks. Baby Fatemeh is different because she did not receive care immediately, Armsby said.\n\n\u201cThat has complicated her condition,\u201d Armsby said. \u201cSo the blood flow throughout her heart and lungs has certainly begun to injure her lungs.\u201d\n\nDoctors at the conference said that, while Iran has excellent hospitals, it is unlikely this procedure could be done there. By contrast, the Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital sees about six to 10 of those operations in a year, according to Dr. Irving Shen, the surgeon who will operate on Fatemeh.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know about her condition, we anticipate a very good result, a surgery that will provide her a very active and full life,\u201d Armsby said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re excited to get to meet her and her family.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked travel ban\n\nAfter four years and Trump\u2019s travel ban, a child meets her family\n\nLawyers continue airport campouts amid Trump travel ban", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
