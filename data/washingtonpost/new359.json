Chip Somodevilla/Pool photo via Bloomberg News\n\nThe statements President Trump issued on Twitter in recent days lead to a chilling conclusion: The man is out of control.\n\nI know that is a radical thing to say about the elected leader of the United States, the most powerful individual in the world. And I know his unorthodox use of social media is thought by some, including the president himself, to be brilliant. But I don\u2019t see political genius in the invective coming from Trump these days. I see an angry man lashing out at enemies real and imagined \u2014 a man dangerously overwhelmed.\n\nOn Monday, he started at 6:25 a.m. to comprehensively undermine his own legal team in its quest to win Supreme Court approval for a travel ban targeting Muslims. I can call it that, without legalistic hemming and hawing, because the president did so. Emphatically.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nMaybe he thinks that tweets, somehow, don\u2019t count. But of course they do. These are written statements typed by the president himself, and as such should carry more weight than a processed release from the White House press office, not less. Trump\u2019s lawyers \u2014 arguing in support of the blocked measure, which would bar visitors from six majority-Muslim countries \u2014 contend it is not a \u201ctravel ban\u201d as such. Attorneys on the other side will surely use Trump\u2019s own words against him.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd he had plenty more to say:\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. [Supreme Court]\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2014 & seek much tougher version!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nLet that last one settle in for a moment. Has a president ever publicly dismissed the entire judicial branch of our government as \u201cslow and political,\u201d even in a moment of pique? Does Trump grasp the concept of separation of powers? Has he even read the Constitution he swore to preserve, protect and defend?\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign \u2014 calling for a surely unconstitutional blanket ban on Muslim visitors from anywhere \u2014 should be taken into account by courts considering the current \u201cwatered down\u201d version is debatable. His written statements as president, however, are clearly germane. Opponents of the ban might want to send him flowers.\n\nTrump first let the cat out of the bag Saturday night, following the terrorist attack in London, when he wrote, \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nHe went on to express compassion and support for \u201cLondon and the U.K.\u201d But by Sunday he was off the rails: \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhat rational head of state attacks the mayor of a city that has just been hit by terrorists? Why would Trump do such a thing, in the process taking Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s words out of context in a way that totally changed their meaning? Because last year Khan, perhaps the highest-profile Muslim public official in a non-Muslim country, criticized then-candidate Trump, saying that his \u201cignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe.\u201d\n\nWhat Khan actually said Sunday was that the public had \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d about an increased police presence on the streets \u2014 not, as Trump suggests, that they should be nonchalant about terrorism. Khan\u2019s stoic and defiant response is in the tradition of Churchill\u2019s during the Blitz of 1940 and 1941, and Thatcher\u2019s during the Irish Republican Army\u2019s terrorism campaign. Londoners have rallied around him. Trump, by contrast, sounds like a ridiculous Chicken Little squawking about the coop.\n\nWords have consequences. Trump\u2019s may hurt British Prime Minister Theresa May in Thursday\u2019s election. Assuming she survives, she will have learned a lesson about getting too close to a volcanic president who might at any minute erupt.\n\nWe already knew that Trump had a narrow mind and a small heart. Now we must wonder about his emotional stability, his grasp of reality, or both.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
