(Zakaria Zakaria for The Washington Post)\n\nAs judges deliberated President Trump\u2019s travel ban, four children from the Syrian city of Aleppo were slipping and sliding across the floor of an airport in Turkey as the clock to their new life counted down.\n\nAfter years in a temporary apartment, 9-year-old Mohamed Tawouz imagined having his own room one day. His 6-year-old brother, Malik, just wanted a new teddy bear.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order had torpedoed their dreams and left them with few options.\n\n\u201cThat last week felt like a year to us. But now I\u2019m just so happy,\u201d sister Wajeeha, 11, said with a grin late Tuesday before their flight. \u201cI haven\u2019t done this before. Will it be scary on the plane?\u201d\n\nWith legal challenges to Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries ongoing, families were waiting at airports across the Middle East, with flights rebooked and hopes for a new life rekindled.\n\nThe Tawouz children wait for their Feb. 8 flight to Buffalo. (Zakaria Zakaria for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Tawouz family\u2019s bags were already packed Jan. 27 when they learned that Trump\u2019s executive order had put a Feb. 1 flight to Buffalo out of reach. On Tuesday night at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, those same $3 black bags were full again, crammed with baby clothes and jars of fiery red peppers from the city they had fled four years earlier.\n\n[Trump suggests only politics could lead court to rule against travel order]\n\nAll week, Wajeeha had struggled to hold back tears at any mention of the home they had been promised in New York. Now she was wide-eyed at the prospect of her first plane journey and brimming with confidence at the speed with which she would learn English.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll learn it from YouTube and the people in the streets,\u201d she said in Arabic with a laugh. Neither she nor her siblings would sleep Tuesday night as they waited for their flight.\n\nBut not everyone in the family was so jubilant. Watching his children zoom about, Majid Tawouz felt an anxiety he could not shake. He knew that a U.S. court could rule on his family\u2019s fate before they landed in Upstate New York. He also knew there were more challenges ahead.\n\nThe questions of friends back home still troubled him: Would they face suspicion in America? What about racism? And after everything they had read, would his family ever really feel accepted?\n\nMore pressing still were worries about the flight. \u201cIt\u2019s a first for all of us. I\u2019m going to have to film the takeoff,\u201d Tawouz said.\n\nSyria\u2019s almost six-year-old war has claimed half a million lives and spurred the largest refu\u00adgee crisis since World War II. With millions of Syrians now spread across Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and beyond, the Trump administration has said the order is a matter of national security.\n\n[Will this Syrian family make it to its final destination?]\n\nAfter almost two years of vetting by international and government agencies, the Syrian families gathered at the Istanbul airport were aghast at the idea they could be considered a security risk.\n\nOne Kurdish man had fled the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. \u201cI hate those people,\u201d he said of the militants. \u201cI\u2019d even accept the devil coming to retake my city. I spent years getting my house ready there. They took everything from me.\u201d\n\nSuch thoughts were far from the children\u2019s minds. Thinking ahead to New York, Wajeeha said she wanted to become a pediatrician. Malik was intrigued by the role of the supermarket cashier. \u201cI could pass products through the bar-code reader and listen to that beep,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then it was time to go.\n\nLeaning across the check-in counter, an attendant asked Tawouz if he understood that the family had to relinquish their bags, and the life they contained, until they landed in New York on Wednesday. Placing his hand on the pile, he paused briefly and then, after days of frowning, gently smiled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.\n\nLoveluck reported from Beirut.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump suggests only politics could lead court to rule against order\n\nDenied Entry: Stories of refugees and immigrants barred from the U.S.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
