(Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nA second federal judge issued an injunction Thursday blocking enforcement of one of the critical sections of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, using Trump\u2019s own comments against him in deciding that the ban was likely to run afoul of the Constitution.\n\nThe decision from U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in federal court in Maryland marks another win for challengers of the president\u2019s executive order, which had been slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Earlier, a different federal judge in Hawaii stopped it.\n\nChuang\u2019s order did not sweep as broadly as the one in Hawaii, but he similarly declared that even the revised travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims. He said those wanting evidence of anti-Muslim intent need look no further than what the president himself has said about it.\n\nChuang\u2019s ruling won\u2019t upend or call into question the decision in Hawaii, instead offering some measure of reinforcement, and a different appeals court through which the government would likely have to pass.\n\n\u201cThe history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang wrote.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n[Read the federal judge\u2019s ruling in Md. on Trump\u2019s revised travel ban]\n\nLee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer representing those challenging the ban in Maryland, said the ruling in his case was significant in that \u201ctwo judges have looked at the revised order, and both have come to the same conclusion that it continues to be a Muslim ban.\u201d He said he was also encouraged that yet another judge was willing to look beyond the order itself to the president\u2019s comments and other potential evidence of discriminatory intent.\n\nThe Justice Department said that it strongly disagreed with the ruling in the Hawaii case, and that the executive order Trump issued \u201cfalls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s next legal step is unclear. The Justice Department has said only that it will \u201ccontinue to defend this Executive Order in the courts.\u201d\n\n[What\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0]\n\nAt a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, Trump said he was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court. He also mused about a return to his original executive order, which imposed a more sweeping ban than the second.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u201d\n\nThe first order temporarily barred entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and suspended the U.S. refu\u00adgee program. When it was implemented, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some travelers affected while in transit were detained and deported from U.S. airports.\n\nOfficials had hoped the revised version would be more defensible in court. It reduced the list of countries affected to six \u2014 removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It also applied only to those seeking new visas, and spelled out a robust list of those who might be exempted. The new order maintained the suspension of the refu\u00adgee program.\n\n[Federal judge in Hawaii freezes President Trump\u2019s new entry ban]\n\nOn Wednesday, with the order set to go into effect in just hours, federal judges in three states heard urgent challenges to the measure. The case in Maryland was brought by three organizations and six people, claiming the order affected their work or prevented their family members from the affected countries from getting visas to enter the United States.\n\nChuang blocked only the provision of the new order affecting the issuance of visas to those from the six affected countries. He said those suing had \u201cnot provided a sufficient basis\u201d for him to declare the other sections invalid.\n\nIn Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson went further, also suspending the portion of the order that affected refugees.\n\nHis ruling will be undisturbed by Chuang\u2019s, and appeals courts would ultimately have to decide to what extent each of them was right.\n\nJustice Department lawyers had argued that the ban was necessary for national security. As evidence to support their claim, they pointed to a request from the U.S. attorney general and homeland security secretary \u2014 penned March 6, after the first ban had been frozen \u2014 asking for the measure. They also pointed to more than 300 people who they said entered the United States as refugees and were the subjects of counterterrorism investigations\n\nChuang wrote that he \u201cshould not, and will not, second-guess the conclusion that national security interests would be served by the travel ban,\u201d but if the national security rationale was secondary to an attempt to disfavor a particular religion, he had no choice but to block the executive order.\n\n\u201cIn this highly unique case,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban.\u201d\n\nThe same federal district court judge in Washington who blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban is also considering challenges to the new one.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
