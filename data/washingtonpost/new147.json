(David Zalubowski/Associated Press)\n\nThe executive order issued by President Trump on Friday, temporarily barring citizens from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the U.S., caused numerous protests and created ripples in the sports world. Among those speaking out Sunday against the administration\u2019s move were a pair of NBA coaches, Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr.\n\nThe two have already emerged as prominent critics of Trump, particularly Popovich, whose lengthy comments last week included saying of the president, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten to the point where you really can\u2019t believe anything that comes out of his mouth.\u201d On Sunday, Popovich referred to the confusion surrounding the reach, not to mention legality, of the executive order.\n\n[\u2018Not what he died for\u2019: Pat Tillman\u2019s widow dismayed by Trump\u2019s ban]\n\n\u201cAs you already know, I have lots of thoughts about what we\u2019ve done to ourselves as a country and what we\u2019ve allowed to happen,\u201d the Spurs coach said (via ESPN\u2019s Michael C. Wright). \u201cBut we\u2019ll see where this goes.\n\n\u201cObviously the rollout today was Keystone Kops-like by any measure with objectivity. Whether you want to say it\u2019s good or bad is irrelevant. But it was Keystone Kops, and that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nKerr, who made light last week of White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s claims about attendance at the inauguration, struck a much more somber tone Sunday. He referred to his father, Dr. Malcolm Kerr, who was president of American University of Beirut, and was assassinated there by Islamic terrorists in 1984.\n\n\u201cI would just say \u2014 as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism \u2014 having lost my father, if we\u2019re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about, and creating fear, it\u2019s the wrong way to go about it,\u201d the Warriors coach told reporters. \u201cIf anything, we could be breeding anger and terror, so I\u2019m completely against what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking. It\u2019s a horrible idea, and I really feel for all of the people who are affected, the families that are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world. It\u2019s going about it completely opposite. You want to solve terror, you want to solve crime, this is not the way to do it.\u201d\n\nSteve Kerr \u2014 \"as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism\" \u2014 speaks out against Donald Trump's recent executive order pic.twitter.com/YbCH2sn0hw \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 30, 2017\n\n[U.S. basketball players \u2018stranded\u2019 in Dubai, unable to return to team in Iran]\n\nKerr added that, while he had not had a chance over the weekend to discuss the executive order with his players, he and his team \u201ctalk a lot about this stuff.\u201d Just after the election, Golden State forward David West had said, \u201cThis whole fairy tale about some post-racial \u2026 this utopia that Obama supposedly created, it\u2019s all bull. That\u2019s the bottom line. When you look at what the results say from last night, this nation has not moved a thread in terms of its ideals.\u201d\n\nThat election roiled the NBA, with many prominent league figures, including Kerr and Popovich, decrying what they saw as a national turn in the wrong direction.
