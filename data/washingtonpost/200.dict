According to senior administration officials, the new rendition will not include a ban on Syrian refugees, but it will still temporarily prohibit travel to the United States by migrants (this time exempting U.S. green-card holders) from the same seven majority-Muslim countries that were barred by the last one.\n\nBut there are several basic factors that even the cleverest legal tweaks cannot change about this situation, no matter how hard the White House tries to obfuscate them out of existence:\n\n1) Trump repeatedly campaigned on an explicit ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and there is little doubt that discriminating against Muslims remains the intent of the ban, even in its new form.\n\n2) Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller has flatly stated that the White House\u2019s real goal here is to establish to the media and Trump\u2019s political opponents that his power to act (nominally) in the interests of our national security \u201cwill not be questioned.\u201d In other words, the White House has left little doubt that it views the battle over the ban as crucial to a bigger goal: establishing that our institutions cannot constrain Trump.\n\n3) The White House\u2019s own arguments justifying the ban on national security grounds are mostly nonsense. The White House has argued that dozens of instances of \u201cterroristic activity\u201d originated with people from the seven targeted countries, which is an absurd exaggeration. The White House has also justified the inclusion of those seven countries by arguing that the Obama administration had also warned that people from those countries constitute a terror threat, but as Glenn Kessler has shown, the context was vastly different, and in any case, former president Barack Obama did not adopt the same response that Trump has done.\n\n[Pay no mind to Trump. He\u2019s just the president.]\n\nMeanwhile, terrorism experts say that no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack carried out since 9/11 by people from those countries.\n\nNone of these basic facts will be changed by the new version of the ban.\n\nA new version of a Trump administration travel ban will not stop green card residency holders or travelers already on planes from entering the United States, according to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly who spoke at the Munich Security Conference. (Reuters)\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that the new version of the ban will get blocked by the courts. It very well may not. CNN reports that the ACLU believes that it will still be vulnerable to legal challenge, even with some of these changes. But it\u2019s possible that the courts will allow it to proceed, at least for now. And at any rate, the underlying legal dispute has yet to be resolved. As legal observer Benjamin Wittes recently noted, there are several big questions: First, how sweeping are the president\u2019s powers to ban classes of people, by, say, nationality? Second, to what degree is that authority limited by the Constitution? And finally, there\u2019s this:\n\nThe other question \u2026 is the extent to which the repeated and overt invocations of the most invidious motivations on the part of the President himself, his campaign, his adviser, and his Twitter feed will render an otherwise valid exercise of this power invalid.\n\nThe basic facts about the lead-up to the ban remain what they are. Trump campaigned on a Muslim ban. When his administration rolled out its first iteration of that, it became obvious that the slapdash and reckless process behind it showed that its policy and legal rationale were largely arbitrary. What\u2019s more, its real motives were clear. There was the desire to prove that some version of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d campaign promise could be honored quickly (Trump is a \u201cman of action,\u201d gushed Kellyanne Conway). And there was the deliberate effort to signal that our institutions will not constrain Trump, laying the groundwork for much more along these lines later (\u201cour opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned,\u201d snarled Stephen Miller).\n\nTime will tell whether this history will end up having legal relevance to the ban\u2019s long-term fate, by \u201crendering an otherwise valid exercise of Trump\u2019s power invalid.\u201d But whether it does or not, that history \u2014 which lays bare the proposal\u2019s real intent, in multiple ways \u2014 can\u2019t be made to disappear.\n\n********************************************************************\n\n* GORSUCH NOT ANSWERING CRUCIAL QUESTIONS: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tells Carl Hulse that he privately questioned Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch about the relationship between the executive and judicial branches, and got nothing:\n\n\u201cHe really backed away from it. Even in the most general constitutional terms, he didn\u2019t want to discuss it. From where I am sitting I don\u2019t think there is a more important question in light of this president.\u201d\n\nThis is too bad. Now, perhaps more than ever before, we really need to know whether this nominee sees the independence of the judiciary \u2014 as a check on the executive \u2014 as paramount.\n\n* HOUSE REPUBLICANS FACE PROTESTS: CNN reports that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is the latest to be confronted by angry protesters, in what has emerged as a larger trend:\n\nThe first hint of trouble for Republicans came two weeks ago, when Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz was confronted by hundreds of angry protesters at his town hall. Since then, Republican lawmakers have canceled town halls, while others have split town entirely \u2014 heading on Congressional delegation trips to spots like the Mexican border and Europe. So what\u2019s the big deal? Republicans can just claim George Soros is funding all the protests and tell themselves everything they\u2019re doing is going just fine. * TRUMP\u2019S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER IS SKEPTICAL OF RUSSIA, IRAN: Trump has chosen Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as his new national security adviser. The Post reports: Peter Feaver, a scholar on civil-military ties at Duke University, said he expected McMaster to take a skeptical view of Russia, seeing Moscow as a dubious partner and major potential threat to U.S. security. And Feaver said he expects a similar skepticism toward Iran\u2026In the Iraq War\u2026his strategy, dubbed \u201cclear, hold and build,\u201d became a model for the broader campaign\u2026to stabilize Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Two things to watch, then, will be the fate of sanctions on Russia and the Iran nuclear deal. [The Trump White House is already cooking the books] * HERE\u2019S A SPECIAL ELECTION TO WATCH: FiveThirtyEight reports that the special election to replace Tom Price (Trump\u2019s new health and human services secretary) in the Atlanta suburbs will be a key political indicator. Price easily won the district last time. But: Trump barely carried it in the 2016 general election \u2026 Trump struggled largely because the district is highly educated \u2014 60 percent of people 25 or older in the district have a college degree, compared with just 31 percent nationally. Mitt Romney won this district by over 20 percentage points in 2012 \u2026 [This] could be our first real test of whether Democrats can make inroads into traditionally red districts that were wary of Trump.\n\nOne big question in the 2018 midterms will be whether Democrats can pick off GOP districts with a lot of college-educated whites, should those voters be more alienated by the Trump presidency.\n\n* TRUMP IS SET TO ROLL BACK OBAMA CLIMATE AGENDA: The Post reports that Trump is set to roll out an executive order, as early as this week, that instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to rewrite Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. That, in turn, is key to meeting our commitments to the Paris climate accord. Environmental groups will fight the rollback, and it\u2019s possible it could take years or end up not mattering all that much. But this is a reminder that Trump could deliver a major setback to international efforts to fight global warming, with untold long-term consequences. * SENIOR TRUMP ADVISER IS FROM THE \u2018FRINGE\u2019: The Post has an eye-opening profile of one Sebastian Gorka, who is now a senior adviser to Trump and believes we\u2019re locked in a global showdown with Islamo-facism: For years, Gorka had labored on the fringes of Washington and the far edge of acceptable debate as defined by the city\u2019s Republican and Democratic foreign policy elite. Today, the former national security editor for the conservative Breitbart News outlet occupies a senior job in the White House and his controversial ideas \u2014 especially about Islam \u2014 drive Trump\u2019s populist approach to counterterrorism and national security. In an interview, Gorka says that he \u201ccompletely jettisons\u201d the idea that the terrorism problem is \u201cnuanced and complicated.\u201d It\u2019s about \u201creligious ideology.\u201d Who needs nuance and complexity, anyway? * AND THE TWEET OF THE DAY: A prominent figure tweeted just moments ago about the rash of bomb threats to Jewish community centers and other anti-Semitic incidents we\u2019ve been seeing across the country. But it wasn\u2019t President Trump: JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017\n\nIvanka Trump condemned the attacks, and the White House put out a milquetoasty statement about them.
