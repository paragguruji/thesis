The suspension of the order, meanwhile, has allowed those previously banned more time to try to reach the United States.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.

The Justice Department said it would not elevate the dispute to the Supreme Court before that.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump responded to the development Sunday by writing on Twitter that he had \u201cinstructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY.\u201d A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman did not immediately return messages seeking comment on how, practically, that screening would be implemented.\n\n\u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIf something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d\n\nTrump further came to the defense of his stalled order Monday. In a tweet, Trump dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d various polls showing opposition to the executive order. \u201cSorry,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cpeople want border security and extreme vetting.\u201d\n\n[The order denying the Trump administration\u2019s request to restore the travel ban]\n\nThe next few days will be telling for the future of the president\u2019s executive order. The states of Washington and Minnesota, which are challenging the ban, asked the appeals court in the wee hours of Monday to keep the ban suspended, and Justice Department lawyers have until 6 p.m. to respond. The court will then schedule a hearing or rule whether the ban should remain on hold.\n\nEarly Monday, two former secretaries of state \u2014 John F. Kerry and Madeline Albright \u2014 joined a six-page joint statement saying Trump\u2019s order \u201cundermines\u201d national security and will \u201cendanger U.S. troops in the field.\u201d The rare declaration, addressed to the 9th Circuit, was also backed by top former national security officials including Leon Panetta, who served as a past CIA director and defense secretary during the Obama administration.\n\n[Court document: Declaration of National Security Officials]\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended View Photos After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.

Some successfully reunited with family members, while others \u2014 particularly those whose visas were physically taken or marked as invalid \u2014 ran into roadblocks trying to board planes overseas.\n\nAt Dulles on Sunday, immigration lawyers could be heard on phones, arguing with airline representatives to let their passengers board as some seemed confused over the various court rulings and what they meant.\n\nOn Monday, the Somali traveler Aidid was elated once he heard the entry stamp hitting his passport. Aidid, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, had a temporary visa so he and his childhood sweetheart could get married in the United States.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. We had waited so long,\u201d he said, referring to the two-year process for the visa.\n\nHe said he did not sleep the entire 15-hour flight from Dubai. From Dulles, Aidid headed to his aunt\u2019s home in Asburn to get some rest.\n\nWhat lies ahead is likely to be a weeks-long battle that will be waged in courtrooms across the country over whether Trump\u2019s ban can pass legal muster. Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere have blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts said he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. The lawsuits now stretch from D.C. to Hawaii, and the number seems to grow regularly.\n\nThe Trump administration has been steadfast in its support of the executive order, which it says is necessary for national security, and the president himself tweeted repeatedly his disdain for the judge in Washington state who put a stop to it.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump wrote Saturday.\n\n[Trump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked entry ban]\n\nVice President Pence said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d that White House officials felt that Trump was \u201coperating within his authority as president, both under the Constitution and under clear statutory law.\u201d Legal analysts have said the president has broad authority to set immigration policy, although civil liberties advocates have countered that the order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims that has no real national security purpose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to prevail,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019ll accomplish the stay and will win the case on the merits. But again, the focus here is on the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday morning television talk shows, some Republicans in Congress took issue with comments by the president, particularly his description of U.S. District Judge James L. Robart as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t understand language like that,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges, we don\u2019t have so-called senators, we don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. . . . So, we don\u2019t have any so-called judges, we have real judges.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said: \u201cWe all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\u201d\n\nMcConnell went on to offer a broader critique of Trump\u2019s executive order than he had previously: \u201cWe all want to try to keep terrorists out of the United States. But we can\u2019t shut down travel. We certainly don\u2019t want Muslim allies who have fought with us in countries overseas to not be able to travel to the United States. We need to be careful about this.\u201d\n\nSeveral federal judges have ruled against the administration on its implementation of the ban, though the case now before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit is perhaps the most significant one. It stems from a lawsuit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota, which alleged that the immigration order was \u201cseparating families, harming thousands of the States\u2019 residents, damaging the States\u2019 economies, hurting State-based companies, and undermining both States\u2019 sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.\u201d\n\nResponding to those arguments, Robart temporarily halted the ban on Friday. Then, 9th Circuit Judges William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, denied the Justice Department\u2019s request on Sunday to immediately restore it.\n\n[Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says]\n\nThe Justice Department could have gone straight to the Supreme Court, but a Justice Department spokesman said it would not do so.\n\n\u201cWith the fast briefing schedule the appeals court laid out, we do not plan to ask the Supreme Court for an immediate stay but instead let the appeals process play out,\u201d spokesman Peter Carr said.\n\nAlthough the side that loses can request intervention from the nation\u2019s highest judicial body, it would take the votes of five justices to overturn the panel\u2019s decision. The court has been shorthanded since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago, and it is ideologically divided between four more liberal justices and four conservative-leaning ones.\n\nLeon Fresco, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said he was \u201csurprised that there is this exuberance to immediately rescind the executive order,\u201d particularly given the timing issues.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, which barred all refugees as well as citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States, was temporary. Refugees were banned for 120 days. The others were barred for 90 days, except those from Syria, whose travel to the United States was blocked indefinitely. The order was purportedly designed to give the administration time to formulate a plan on how to vet people coming from countries that have terrorist activity.\n\n\u201cIt is perplexing why the government wouldn\u2019t want to simply, at this point, maintain an orderly process in one court as opposed to fighting it out all across the country in different courts, and working its way to the Supreme Court,\u201d Fresco said. \u201cUnless the goal is to have an outright travel ban forever, and we should take the president at his word that that\u2019s not the goal, then let\u2019s just have calmer heads prevail and conduct the security analysis that was going to be conducted during these 90 days.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if Trump\u2019s ban were to be immediately reinstated, that might spark chaos similar to what occurred when it was first rolled out on Jan. 27. To implement the order then, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas. When people began landing at U.S. airports, Customs and Border Protection officers detained more than 100 people and deported some, sparking protests and lawsuits across the country.\n\nIt was unclear Sunday whether U.S. officials had a plan in place to avoid a repeat of that scenario, though much would depend on what specifically was ordered by a court, and when. Spokesmen for the State Department and Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the question.\n\nIn an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News that aired Sunday afternoon, Trump insisted that the initial implementation of his order was \u201cvery smooth\u201d and said \u2014 misleadingly \u2014 that \u201cyou had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers, and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully.\u201d That does not take into account the tens of thousands of people who could not travel because their visa was revoked; nor does it acknowledge those who were taken out of the country after their plane landed.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that because of Robart\u2019s ruling, it was suspending enforcement of the executive order entirely, and the State Department restored the visas that had been provisionally revoked. Advocates encouraged travelers from the affected countries who qualified for entry to get on planes as soon as possible because of the unpredictable legal terrain.\n\nEarly Sunday, the Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene, asserting that it was improper for a lower court to engage in \u201csecond-guessing\u201d of the president\u2019s judgment on a national security matter.\n\n[The Justice Department\u2019s argument to restore the travel ban]\n\n\u201cThe injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation\u2019s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and \u00adsecond-guesses the President\u2019s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk,\u201d acting solicitor general Noel Francisco wrote in a brief.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for a district judge to issue an order that affects the entire country, but Robart, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and has been on the bench since 2004, said it was necessary to follow Congress\u2019s intention that \u201cthe immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.\u201d\n\nHe was quoting from a 2015 appeals court ruling that had blocked Obama\u2019s executive action that would have made it easier for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States. It was never implemented because of legal challenges.\n\nAntonio Olivo, Fred Barbash, Darryl Fears, Mike DeBonis, Spencer S.
