Watson wrote that he would not \u201cusurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court,\u201d and if those suing over the ban wanted relief, they should take their claims there.\n\nThat means the government, at least for now, can use the travel ban to block citizens of the affected countries if they are the grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law of people in the United States. Officials can also block refugees with a formal assurance from a resettlement agency.\n\nThe administration had wanted to keep such people out, and thought a recent Supreme Court ruling partially lifting lower courts\u2019 freezes on the travel ban allowed them to do so. But those who had sued over the ban disagreed, and they asked Watson to intervene \u2014 which he declined to do.\n\n[Travel ban takes effect as State Department defines \u2018close family\u2019]\n\n\u201cBecause Plaintiffs seek clarification of the June 26, 2017 injunction modifications authored by the Supreme Court, clarification should be sought there, not here,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nNeal Katyal, a lawyer for those challenging the ban, noted on Twitter the ruling offered no decision on the \u201cmerits of dispute,\u201d but simply said it was the Supreme Court\u2019s place to decide.\n\nThe Supreme Court had ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not on those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States.\n\nThe court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d\n\nThe government put the measure into effect on June 29, suspending the refu\u00adgee program and barring the issuance of new visas to residents of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria without U.S. connections. But for opponents of the ban, the administration\u2019s interpretation of who had a connection was too narrow.\n\nThe administration said it would let into the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. (Officials initially wanted to keep out fiances, but later relented.)\n\nStill banned, though, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees that had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency.\n\n[What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban ruling means]\n\nHawaii, which had initially sued over the ban, objected in court, asking Watson to clarify that such people could not be blocked.\n\n\u201cThe Government does not have discretion to ignore the Court\u2019s injunction as it sees fit,\u201d lawyers representing the state wrote.\n\nThe government shot back that it was drawing lines on who counted as a close family member based on its interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Justice Department lawyers asserted that the Supreme Court had made clear not all people with U.S. connections should be allowed in.\n\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court instructed, not all relationships with a person in the United States suffice to fall outside the stay and within the injunction,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. \u201cIndeed, not even all familial relationships suffice; rather, a \u2018close familial relationship\u2019 is required.\u201d\n\nThe matter is likely bound for higher courts. The government had asked Watson to put his ruling on hold pending \u201can immediate request to the Supreme Court for clarification of its ruling,\u201d and even those suing agreed that any disputes remaining after Watson\u2019s order \u201cshould be dealt with through expedited appellate review.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the fall on whether Trump\u2019s travel ban can pass legal muster. So far, it has only temporarily blocked lower courts\u2019 injunctions. Some of the justices predicted there might be problems before that.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in an opinion joined by justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote that he would have restored Trump\u2019s travel ban in full, in part because he felt the court\u2019s move to restore it only partially would prove \u201cunworkable\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThe compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \u2018bona fide relationship,\u2019 who precisely has a \u2018credible claim\u2019 to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed \u2018simply to avoid\u2019 the executive order, he wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["ruling", "travel", "relationship", "hawaii", "exempt", "courts", "ban", "supreme", "judge", "court", "united", "states", "trumps", "bid", "rejects", "watson", "grandparents"], "summary": "Grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States are not exempt from President Trump\u2019s travel ban, a federal judge effectively decided Thursday as he denied a bid to curtail enforcement of the executive order meant to keep out citizens of six Muslim-majority countries.\nThat means the government, at least for now, can use the travel ban to block citizens of the affected countries if they are the grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law of people in the United States.\nThe administration had wanted to keep such people out, and thought a recent Supreme Court ruling partially lifting lower courts\u2019 freezes on the travel ban allowed them to do so.\n[What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban ruling means]Hawaii, which had initially sued over the ban, objected in court, asking Watson to clarify that such people could not be blocked.\nJustice Department lawyers asserted that the Supreme Court had made clear not all people with U.S. connections should be allowed in."}
