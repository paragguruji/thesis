They were prepared to emigrate from a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey to the United States until President Trump\u2019s refugee travel ban went into effect. (Louisa Loveluck/The Washington Post)\n\nLast month, the Tawouz family were told a new life in the United States was just days away. Last week, they learned they were no longer welcome. And by Saturday, they had no idea what to believe.\n\nFour years after they fled the bombs of Aleppo, Syria, despair turned to joy as they heard that a federal judge had blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s controversial entry ban on refugees and nationals of seven \u00admajority-Muslim nations, their family among them.\n\nBut as the day wore on, the clouds of uncertainty crept back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hopeful, we\u2019ve been devastated. Now we just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Majid Tawouz, a father of five, reached by phone in the Turkish capital, Ankara.\n\nTawouz and his five children are among the thousands left in limbo after a Jan. 27 executive order barred nationals from the seven countries from entering the United States, suggesting they could be a threat to national security. The order also explicitly banned Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nThe news Friday that U.S. District Judge James L. Robart had temporarily blocked that order has left the refugees in a bind: Hope too much and risk devastation when resettlement is blocked again; don\u2019t hope at all and risk giving up altogether.\n\n[Travelers rush from banned countries: \u2018No one knows how long the window will last\u2019]\n\nTheir bags had been packed and were nearly bursting on the morning in late January when they learned they would not need them. The official who called said that he was sorry and that he was just doing his job. \u201cHe just kept apologizing and saying these were orders from above,\u201d Tawouz said.\n\n\u201cI asked them how I could explain this to my daughter. We had told her a plane would take her to a place she could get treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Wajeeha, 11, the suspension meant an indefinite wait for hormone treatment that the family cannot afford in Turkey, leaving her in pain and unable to grow. For her younger brother, it meant longer until a doctor can explain why his bones have grown curved.\n\nSyria\u2019s almost six-year-long crisis has pushed at least 4.5 million refugees into Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. With limited rights to work and education, many now struggle badly to make ends meet.\n\nThe United States had resettled more than 15,000 Syrians, most arriving within the past year. Although the State Department said it did not publicly disclose figures for the number of Syrian families affected by the suspension, aid officials suggested it was in the thousands. According to the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, more than 800 \u2014 of all nationalities \u2014 had been set to make the United States their home this past week alone.\n\nThe program focused on resettling those requiring urgent medical or psychological treatment, and households headed by vulnerable women.\n\n[Trump\u2019s executive order barred Iranian baby in need of heart surgery]\n\nNow stuck in limbo, Syrian families interviewed last week spoke of heartbreak, exhaustion and fear.\n\nIn Jordan, Mohammed Hassoun, tortured for six months in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s prison network, described the suspension as a \u201cdagger\u201d to his dreams. In Lebanon, a young woman \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear for the safety of her husband, still in the notorious Damascus jail from which she had been freed \u2014 said that she had spent the week mired in depression. \u201cYou cannot understand the haze that I feel. I lost my husband, then I lost my future,\u201d she said.\n\nBut for Trump supporters, the ban represented a promise kept. During campaign rallies, he repeatedly claimed that Islamist militants were posing as refugees to enter and attack U.S. cities \u2014 a claim yet to be proved. That logic was echoed in Trump\u2019s executive order, which said the president himself would be the judge of whether \u201csufficient changes\u201d had been made to the vetting process.\n\nCurrent and former officials involved in the 21-stage admissions process for Syrian refugees said it was unclear what further checks could be introduced to improve the system.\n\n\u201cThis is a process that was already adapting. Over the years we brought on more and more steps as the situation evolved,\u201d said Natasha Hall, a former immigration officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Turkey. These included new questions, additional layers of vetting, formal training to help interviewers identify a variety of potential \u201cred flags,\u201d and introducing new questions.\n\nAn aid official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivities surrounding the suspension, said last week that U.N. officials would probably be expected to sort through already-vetted case files to identify the most vulnerable families for referral to another nation\u2019s resettlement program. In other words, Hall said, \u201cstrains on an already deeply strained system.\u201d\n\n[After four years and Trump\u2019s travel ban, a child meets her family]\n\nIn Ankara, the Tawouz family waited anxiously for news late Saturday in their extended family\u2019s cramped apartment.\n\n\u201cWe left Syria so our children would have a future, and after everything we went through, we thought we had finally got it,\u201d Majid Tawouz said. \u201cThey thought they\u2019d get treated and go to school again.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Wajeeha\u2019s small voice echoed down the phone line. \u201cI was so excited, but now I just feel sad,\u201d she said. \u201cBaba told me there aren\u2019t planes for people like us anymore. Why don\u2019t they want us?\u201d\n\nZakaria Zakaria reported from Istanbul.
