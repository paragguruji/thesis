I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was \u201cparticularly gratified that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was 9-0.\u201d\n\nThe president said last week that the order would go into effect 72 hours after being approved by the courts.\n\nIn the opinion, the court said it will hear arguments in the case \u2014 which raises fundamental questions about religious discrimination and the president\u2019s broad powers to protect the nation \u2014 when it reconvenes in October.\n\nIn the meantime, the justices nudged the Trump administration to get on with what it said would be a temporary pause to review vetting procedures.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments\u201d within 90 days, the court said.\n\nThat means that by the time the court takes up the case in the fall, circumstances could be quite different. Depending on the results of the review, Trump could push to extend the measure or even make it permanent.\n\nA group of Muslim protesters gathers during a rally against the travel ban at San Diego International Airport on March 6.

Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch would have let the ban take effect as the Trump administration crafted it, and Thomas wrote that the court had made an \u201cimplicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s revised order will \u201cburden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nSuch a compromise, he wrote, will lead to a \u201cflood of litigation\u201d over what constitutes a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d\n\nThe travel ban has been a major point of contention between Trump and civil rights groups, which say it is motivated by unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims.\n\nTrump contends that the ban is necessary to protect the nation while the administration decides whether tougher vetting procedures and other measures are needed. He has railed against federal judges who have blocked the move.\n\nBecause the executive order was stopped by lower courts, travelers from those countries have been entering the United States following normal visa procedures. Trump initially moved to implement the restrictions in January, in his first week in office.\n\n[Analysis: Trump travel ban wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly terrorist attacks]\n\nHis first executive order went into effect immediately and resulted in chaos at airports in the United States and abroad as travelers from the targeted nations were stranded or sent back to their countries.\n\nLawyers for challengers to the order rushed to federal courts, and the order was stayed within days. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit eventually said the order could not be implemented, infuriating the president, who said he would take the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nInstead, his administration regrouped and issued a second order in March. It added a section detailing national security concerns, removed Iraq from the list of countries affected, deleted a section that had targeted Syrian refugees and removed a provision that favored Christian immigrants.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers told courts that the new order was written to respond to the 9th Circuit\u2019s concerns. But new lawsuits were immediately filed, and federal judges once again stopped the implementation.\n\nA federal district judge in Maryland blocked the portion of the order affecting travelers from the six countries. A judge in Hawaii also froze that portion, as well as the part affecting refu\u00adgee programs.\n\nAppeals courts on both coasts upheld those decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond agreed with U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland, who sided with opponents in finding that the ban violates the Constitution by intentionally discriminating against Muslims. In a 10-to-3 decision, the appeals court noted Trump\u2019s remarks before and after his election about a ban on Muslims and said the executive order \u201cin context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit said Trump had not adhered to federal law under which Congress gives the president broad power in immigration matters. They said that national security is not a \u201c \u2018talismanic incantation\u2019 that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201d\n\nIn both appeals courts, a minority of conservative judges said their colleagues were making a mistake. Judges should consider only whether the executive orders were proper on their face, they said, without trying to decide whether the president had ulterior motives, and should defer to national security decisions made by the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds,\u201d wrote dissenting 4th Circuit Judge Paul V. Niemeyer.\n\nJustice, Homeland Security and State department officials said they were still studying the decision to determine exactly who it affects and how it might be carried out.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s opinion seems unlikely to re-create the chaos that ensued after Trump issued his first travel ban, causing tens of thousands of visas to be revoked and some travelers to be detained and sent away from U.S. airports.\n\nTrump already had rescinded and revised his first order so that it affected only the issuance of new visas, and the justices left intact an even more limited version. Advocates nonetheless said they would deploy people to watch for potential abuses.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the U.S.: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted,\u201d said former British foreign secretary David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s court ruling, Trump issued his low-key statement through normal White House channels.\n\nThat was in contrast to his thunderous Twitter offerings when courts previously disagreed with him. He wrote in one such post: \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d\n\nAbigail Hauslohner and Ann E.
