(C-SPAN)\n\nStatements made before and after the election by Donald Trump and his allies about his travel ban have been giving the administration headaches as it defends the executive order\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nThe argument that the ban is purely secular has not fared well with judges when the Trump campaign website stated in advance that its purpose was \u201cpreventing Muslim immigration,\u201d which has sounded to a number of courts like an unconstitutional religion-based restriction.\n\n[Trump\u2019s loose talk about Muslims gets weaponized in court against travel ban]\n\nThe same contradiction keeps coming up in public, too.\n\nMonday, for example, a reporter asked White House press secretary Sean Spicer, \u201cif this White House is no longer calling this a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 \u2026 why does the president\u2019s website still explicitly call for \u2018preventing Muslim immigration?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of what\u2019s on the campaign website,\u201d Spicer responded.\n\nAt that particular moment, the website did indeed include \u201cDONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION.\u201d\n\nIt went on: \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nBut then, shazam, the text on the same Web page went blank. Nothing.\n\n\n\nPress secretary Sean Spicer speaks during a briefing at the White House on May 8. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nABC\u2019s Cecilia Vega appears to have been the first to notice. \u201cMinutes after we asked the WH why the President\u2019s campaign website still called for a Muslim ban, it appears the statement was deleted,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThat was just hours after judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which is reviewing a district-court ruling declaring the ban unconstitutional, questioned administration lawyers about \u201cstatements of the president on the campaign trail,\u201d specifically the one someone tried to erase Monday, only to be told that they shouldn\u2019t be looking at those.\n\n\u201cIs it still there today?\u201d one of the judges asked the lawyer challenging the ban. The lawyer said it was there the last time he looked, a few weeks ago.\n\nLooking at the page as of early Tuesday morning produced only this:\n\nNote, however, the URL, which includes the words \u201cpreventing Muslim immigration.\u201d\n\nThe Internet archive the \u201cWay Back Machine\u201d still houses the original statement:", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-09", "type": "article"}
