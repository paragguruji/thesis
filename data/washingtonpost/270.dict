IRAP, the travel ban case. As Steve Sachs discusses at Prawfsblawg, the court stayed the injunctions in part but left them in place \u201cwith respect to parties similarly situated\u201d to the plaintiffs. The court also ordered \u201ca briefing schedule that will permit the cases to be heard during the first session of October Term 2017,\u201d noting that \u201c(The Government has not requested that we expedite consideration of the merits to a greater extent.).\u201d\n\nNow here is where I get a little puzzled.\n\nConstant readers will recall a disagreement that Marty Lederman and I had about whether the challenges to the executive order were going to become moot on June 14. On June 14, the president issued a memorandum clarifying (or amending, if necessary) \u201cthe effective date of each enjoined provision to be the date and time at which the referenced injunctions are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\u201d This was supposed to stop the mootness problem, and the court Monday also ordered the parties to brief \u201cWhether the challenges to Section 2(c) became moot on June 14, 2017.\u201d\n\nBut is there going to be a new mootness problem? After all, 90 days from now is Sept. 24, which is before the court will hear argument and decide the cases. Marty Lederman says \u201cyes\u201c:\n\nThe case will be moot for two \u2026 reasons: For one thing, the 90-day entry ban goes into effect 72 hours from now, at least as to some aliens (see below), and thus it will expire by its terms on September 27. Moreover, as the Court explains, by October the Section 2 \u201cinternal review\u201d should be completed (\u201c[W]e fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the 90-day life of \u00a72(c).\u201d), and therefore the predicate for the entry ban will be kaput by then, too.\n\nWhat is weird is that the court doesn\u2019t come out and say this exactly. It says:\n\nIn light of the June 12 decision of the Ninth Circuit vacating the injunction as to \u00a72(a), the executive review directed by that subsection may proceed promptly, if it is not already underway. EO\u20132 instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete this review within 20 days, after which time foreign governments will be given 50 days further to bring their practices into line with the Secretary\u2019s directives. \u00a7\u00a72(a)\u2013(b), (d). Given the Government\u2019s representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the 20-day review, we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the 90-day life of \u00a72(c).\n\nA few questions for now:\n\n1. When does Section 2(c) currently expire? The court refers to \u201cthe 90-day life of \u00a72(c),\u201d without explicitly spelling out when that is. The presidential memorandum, mentioned above, says that \u201cthe effective date of each enjoined provision\u201d is \u201cthe date and time at which the referenced injunctions are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\u201d But what if the injunction is stayed in part, as happened Monday? Does that trigger the effective date? Or does it trigger it only \u201cin part,\u201d so that each provision of the ban will now have two effective dates, one for the plaintiffs and other beneficiaries of the injunction and the other for the rest of the world?\n\n2. Even if Section 2(c) doesn\u2019t technically expire, what happens to it once review is complete? I think Marty is right that the travel ban will be much harder to justify at that point. Will the government realize this and stop enforcing the ban? And if not, isn\u2019t the government giving the court the worst possible vehicle for its claims?\n\n3. Why didn\u2019t the court say more about the endgame it seems to have deliberately set up? It does rather seem as if the effect of the ruling is to schedule the case for an argument date that it will never reach and to order the parties to brief a mootness question that will itself be moot, while ignoring the mootness question that will be more relevant in October. So if the court means \u201cthat earlier talk of briefing schedules and additional questions was just for show,\u201d this is a funny way to say it.\n\n4.
