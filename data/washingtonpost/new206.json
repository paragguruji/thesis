We meet all kinds of people. And we conclude at the end that they are all beautiful people.\n\n\u201cWe have bad people in the world, we have bad people in our country, but clearly a large majority of people are good. It\u2019s fabulous when we can give them an opportunity to be part of our country.\u201d\n\nArena\u2019s comments come after NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich spoke out against the White House decisions.\n\n[Cuban on NBA protests of Trump order: \u2018It\u2019s country first, basketball second\u2019]\n\nArena, 65, worked at the University of Virginia from 1978 to 1995 and is the most successful coach in the history of both the U.S. men\u2019s program and Major League Soccer. In his second U.S. stint, which began in December, he will attempt to resurrect the Americans\u2019 hopes of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia after a pair of defeats under his predecessor, Jurgen Klinsmann.\n\nDuring his first tour, which started in late 1998 and lasted almost eight years, Arena took the U.S. team to 22 countries, including Russia and Morocco.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think too many Americans would agree with banning Muslims, nor any other group of people based on religion or race,\u201d said Arena, whose grandparents emigrated from Italy. \u201cBut there are some that believe that\u2019s what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nIn the latest Gallup poll, 55 percent of those interviewed disapprove of Trump\u2019s temporary ban of entry for most people from the seven affected countries. Fifty-eight percent disapprove of the indefinite suspension of the Syrian refugee program.\n\nThe executive orders have been a topic of discussion among more than two-dozen U.S. players who have been together for the past three weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a topic of discussion in our country. Our guys are not immune from the news,\u201d Arena said. \u201cThey know what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the first thing they talk about, but it\u2019s certainly an issue. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one person on our team that thinks a ban on Muslims or any other group is right.\u201d\n\n[Soccer has never known borders. Trump\u2019s travel ban could change that.]\n\nCaptain Michael Bradley was the first to express himself, writing on Instagram last week that he was \u201csad and embarrassed\u201d about the restrictions.\n\nHe also wrote \u201cWhen Trump was elected, I only hoped [he] would be different than the campaigner. That the xenophobic, misogynistic and narcissistic rhetoric would be replaced by a more humble and measured approach to leading our country. I was wrong.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Michael Bradley (@michaelbr4dley) on Jan 28, 2017 at 11:02pm PST\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s friendly against Serbia in San Diego, several other players spoke out.\n\nThe Americans will close their winter camp Friday against Jamaica at Chattanooga\u2019s Finley Stadium, the final test before World Cup qualifying resumes in late March with critical matches against Honduras at San Jose\u2019s Avaya Stadium and at Panama.\n\nArena said about half of the 26 players he plans to summon for the qualifiers will come from the current camp, which, with one exception, had an all-MLS makeup. Many regulars were unavailable for winter workouts because of in-season commitments in European and Mexican leagues.\n\nAmong the newer batch of candidates, Arena cited midfielders Darlington Nagbe and Sebastian Lletget, goalkeeper Nick Rimando, forward Jordan Morris and defender Jorge Villafa\u00f1a as showing well in training camp.\n\nHe said Rimando, Real Salt Lake\u2019s 37-year-old starter, is likely to join English-based Brad Guzan in the three-man keeper corps for the qualifiers. \u201cHe can still be a guy you can count on.\u201d\n\nThe other goalkeeping slot remains unclear: Tim Howard is coming back from groin surgery, while Belgian-based Ethan Horvath, Mexican-based William Yarbrough and multiple MLS figures are in the mix.\n\nTime is running short on Geoff Cameron, the Premier League defender sidelined since October with a knee injury. He spent some time in U.S. camp for evaluation purposes when the players first reported to StubHub Center in Carson, Calif., last month.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled him out yet,\u201d Arena said. The absence of competitive action soon, however, would end Cameron\u2019s hopes for the March matches. \u201cI imagine,\u201d Arena said sarcastically, \u201cthat would be a prerequisite before a World Cup qualifier that you\u2019ve played soccer recently.\u201d\n\nReviewing the camp at large, Arena said the time together, albeit without a complete group, has been beneficial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know the players. I\u2019ve known them from a distance but now I get to know them up close. That helps build the roster for March, which is basically the point of this camp.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "camp", "sad", "bruce", "world", "ban", "players", "soccer", "think", "trumps", "country", "arena", "coach", "team"], "summary": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 Bruce Arena, who just began his second tenure in charge of the U.S. men\u2019s national soccer team, became the latest high-profile coach to criticize President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily barring refugees and others seeking U.S. entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n[Explaining Trump\u2019s travel ban]\u201cI think it\u2019s sad because one thing we do in our sport is that we are a global sport,\u201d he said during a wide-ranging interview Thursday.\n\u201cWe travel the world.\n\u201cWe have bad people in the world, we have bad people in our country, but clearly a large majority of people are good.\nTrump\u2019s travel ban could change that.]"}
