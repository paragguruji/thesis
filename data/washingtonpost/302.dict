Donnelly waited half a year for her chance to convince the Senate that she would make a good federal judge. When the day finally came, she packed as many relatives as she could into the benches.\n\nIn her opening comments, she named every single one of them.\n\nDonnelly introduced the senators to her husband, Michael. Her sister Sarah and brother Thomas. And then their spouses and their four children.\n\nAnd to her mother and late father \u2014 \u201cI know he is watching,\u201d she told the Judiciary Committee in the spring of 2015. And her two daughters, and their boyfriends.\n\nAnd then Saturday night, after a year and a week on the federal bench, Donnelly sat in her own courtroom in Brooklyn while families shouted and cried in airports nationwide.\n\nACLU attorney Lee Gelernt announces to a crowd outside a Brooklyn courthouse that a federal judge had stayed deportations nationwide of those detained on entry to the United States following an executive order from President Trump that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. (ACLU Nationwide/Facebook)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s sudden ban on refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries had interrupted reunions midflight, leaving aunts, nephews, fathers and daughters stranded on opposite sides of security cordons, while federal officials decided who would be deported by presidential decree.\n\nThat\u2019s the night the daughter of Mary and Jack Donnelly \u2014 whose speeches and rulings had rarely traveled beyond courthouse walls \u2014 became known across the world as the first judge to block Trump\u2019s order.\n\nNever before in her long legal career had Donnelly gained such attention. Nowhere close.\n\nHer old college roommate, Darcy Gibson Berglund, remembers the Ohio-raised English major starring in a campus rendition of \u201cPippin\u201d in the late 1970s but then quickly leaving the stage for the law.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an intellectual, she was not going to pursue theater,\u201d Berglund said. But she said her friend retained \u201ca facility with language\u201d after graduating from law school in 1984.\n\nDonnelly spent the next quarter-century as a New York prosecutor. Her most famous case was against two executives who looted their company \u2014 a trial that the New York Times described as \u201csix months of sometimes tedious testimony.\u201d\n\nThe paper recounted Donnelly\u2019s closing arguments in the Tyco International case, when she \u201cat times seemed like a schoolteacher lecturing her students.\u201d\n\nThe executives \u201cbelieved they were above the law, and they believe the rules that apply to other people do not apply to them,\u201d Donnelly told the jury in 2004.\n\nThe men were convicted. This week, some of Donnelly\u2019s old colleagues praised her demeanor during that trial \u2014 one telling the Times she was \u201cthe calm center of the spinning wheel,\u201d even then.\n\nShe made state judge a few years after her victory in the Tyco trial, in 2009, and for years handled mostly criminal trials.\n\n[Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban]\n\nDonnelly would later tell senators that sentencing someone to prison \u201cis one of the most difficult tasks a judge faces.\u201d Some of her cases, however, were so horrific it didn\u2019t seem hard.\n\n\u201cNot only did you strangle this woman, you then chopped her up,\u201d she told a man in 2010, according to the New York Daily News, before sentencing him to 19 years to life for killing his ex-girlfriend and burying her in concrete.\n\nIf the killer were ever released, the paper noted, he would be deported because he had come to the United States illegally.\n\nSeveral years later, a populist Republican would begin crafting campaign speeches around violent immigrants.\n\nBut first, Donnelly had to wait.\n\nAnd wait, and wait, and wait after President Barack Obama nominated her to the federal court in November 2014, promising she would \u201cserve the American people with integrity and an unwavering commitment to justice.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold hearings to approve her for months, a common theme in an era when White House and Congress stood divided.\n\n[McConnell: We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled the committee is finally moving forward,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in May 2015. \u201cI know Ann well.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of her parents in Ohio, and her work prosecuting sex crimes. He told his colleagues of an office Donnelly had left long ago, where \u201cher reputation is legendary.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is at her core a kind, thoughtful, compassionate person,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nHe asked her family to stand. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, it\u2019s a great sight.\u201d\n\nDonnelly\u2019s mother and a dozen-some siblings, children, spouses, nieces and friends all rose in the chamber. One woman wiped tears from her eyes after Donnelly took the table at the front of the room.\n\nThe senators asked her only two questions, and only about criminal law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a certain risk a judge takes,\u201d Donnelly told Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), speaking of times she had tried to rehabilitate rather than punish a young offender, in hopes to \u201csave someone from what is bound to be a life of crime.\u201d\n\nBut mostly, Donnelly spoke of her family before ceding the table and waiting for the Senate\u2019s decision.\n\nAnother half a year passed until the Senate confirmed her, nearly unanimously, with only two nays.\n\n[Senate Democrats vow legislation to block Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nYet more months went by before Donnelly was sworn in, quoting Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, and speaking once again about her family.\n\nShe made no great news for a full year on the federal bench \u2014 until Saturday evening, when protesters thronged major U.S. airports and an executive with the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted directions to Donnelly\u2019s courthouse.\n\n\u201cGo right now if you can,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt had by then been a full day since Trump signed an executive order he said would \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the country \u2014 but which turned out to instantly bar people who had spent weeks or years planning journeys to the United States, and in some cases were already here.\n\nThank you Judge Donnelly !!

They are elderly!\u201d a crying woman shouted in the same airport that night. And in cities from Dallas to Seattle, bewildered families sought missing members, and the ACLU\u2019s emergency request to stop the deportations found its way to Donnelly\u2019s courtroom in New York.\n\nShe had once been a government lawyer, but that night, she showed little patience for their arguments, The Post reported.\n\n\u201cOur own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\u201d Donnelly said, weighing the risks of sending unknown numbers of people back across the oceans.\n\nAn ACLU lawyer interrupted the hearing to warn Donnelly that a flier was about to be deported to war-torn Syria unless she acted immediately.\n\nDonnelly asked whether the government could guarantee that person\u2019s safety and, unconvinced by the answer, issued her order just before 9 p.m.\n\nSending travelers back could cause \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d she ruled. She\u2019d turned more eloquent phrases, but this time her written words were photographed and immediately shared across the world.\n\nStay of ban removals pic.twitter.com/jZjtidm2IF \u2014 Omar C.
