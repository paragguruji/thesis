Here's a look at some of the protests that took place in airports and city squares across the U.S. after the order was signed. (Dalton Bennett,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Elyse Samuels,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nA familiar talking point has permeated the many Republican defenses of Donald Trump's controversial travel entry ban: It's not a \"Muslim ban.\"\n\n\"This is not a ban on Muslim refugees,\" Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) assured. \u201cEverybody needs to take a deep breath; there is no litmus test based on religion,\" Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said. \u201cIt's simply wrong to call the president\u2019s executive order concerning immigration and refugees \u2018a religious test\u2019 of any kind,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) argued.\n\nTrump himself issued a statement Sunday saying the same: \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.\"\n\nFor the record, non-ideological media outlets aren't flat-out calling it a Muslim ban \u2014 just noting that the opposition is making that argument. The executive order makes no explicit mention of a religion Islam, after all. (Correction: The order does mention religion, but not Islam specifically.)\n\nBut it's unavoidable to note that the ban covers citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 the only seven countries it targets. And even some Republicans are suggesting that it amounts to a religious test, or at least worrying it has the appearance of one.\n\nFor for that perception and story line, Trump has himself to thank.\n\nIt was Trump, after all, who once actually did propose a Muslim ban. It's still on his campaign website, more than a year later: \"DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION.\"\n\nThen Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani took to Fox News on Saturday night and said Trump basically was shooting for a Muslim ban with his executive order but recognized it needed to be altered to pass muster.\n\nFox News host Jeannine Pirro asked Giuliani, \u201cHow did the president decide the seven countries?\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll tell you the whole history of it,\" Giuliani said. \"So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'\"\n\nGiuliani continued: \u201cAnd what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger \u2014 the areas of the world that create danger for us. Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\u201d\n\nIt's hard not to read Giuliani's comments as confirmation that a Muslim ban was the original intent, if not the final result. He's basically arguing it's not a Muslim ban because that wasn't practical. And given the particulars of the final result \u2014 even if not explicitly a religious test \u2014 it's not hard to draw a line between A and B.\n\nTrump's long-running commentary has also made clear that he believes Muslims should perhaps be treated differently in some way (though the actual proposals have shifted). A few examples:\n\nAsked about increasing surveillance of Muslims, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely. We\u2019re going to have to look at the mosques. We\u2019re going to have to look very, very carefully.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he would support a \u201cfull Muslim database,\u201d he said: \u201cBasically the suggestion was made and [is] certainly something we should start thinking about.\"\n\nAsked if he would rule out a database on all Muslims, he said no, but then shifted to talking about a database just of refugees. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a database for the refugees that \u2014 if they come into the country. We have no idea who these people are.\"\n\nAnd even as recently as this weekend, Trump again suggested a preference for Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Here's an exchange between him and the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody, which aired Saturday night:\n\nBRODY: Persecuted Christians, we\u2019ve talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you\u2019re looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim, you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible, and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\n\nThe common thread running through these and many of Trump's comments about applying extra scrutiny to Muslims is that he's often asked about something specific, and tends to offer a generally positive response. The most charitable interpretation is that he's just trying to be agreeable.\n\nBut the totality of Trump's comments on this make it impossible to divorce this issue from religion. He's gone to that well too many times, suggesting that it might be okay to single Muslims out \u2014 either for immigration, surveillance or a registry of some kind.\n\nWhich is why you now see even some Republicans saying this looks way too much like a religious test.\n\n\"I am deeply troubled \u200eby the appearance of a religious ban,\" Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said Sunday night. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) added, \u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion.\u201d\n\nTrump and his team will chalk that sort of criticism up to Republicans who don't much like him spouting off. The White House would probably be better served by reviewing rhetoric from the president and some of his top surrogates, up to and including this past weekend.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "type": "article"}
