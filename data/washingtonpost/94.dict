(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nMuslims fearful that President Trump\u2019s travel ban targets them are finding an ally in scholars of Mormon history.\n\nA group of 19 scholars recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit comparing the government\u2019s proposed treatment of Muslims to how it treated Mormons in the 19th century.\n\n\u201cThis Court should ensure that history does not repeat itself,\u201d wrote the scholars, only some of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, popularly known as the Mormon Church. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe court is expected to hear arguments on Trump\u2019s revised ban next month. That ban suspends the admission of new refugees and new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nDistrict court judges in Hawaii and the state of Washington have halted key portions of the ban on the grounds that it likely violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Establishment Clause. The scholars don\u2019t take a position on whether the executive order violates the clause or is \u201cotherwise unlawful.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s talk \u2014 \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 \u2018Islam hates us\u2019 \u2014 comes back to bite him in court again]\n\n\u201cMost relevant to this case, animus against the Mormons led federal officials and lawmakers to attack Mormon immigration,\u201d the scholars said. \u201cIn 1879, the Secretary of State sent a circular letter to all American diplomatic officers, calling on them to pressure European governments to prohibit Mormon emigration from their countries.\u201d\n\nMany Americans and even many Mormons have either forgotten or are unaware of this immigration history, according W. Paul Reeve, who teaches classes on Mormon history at the University of Utah. He was among the scholars who signed the brief.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that it is a piece of evidence that the courts will consider and help them as they deliberate the course they will take,\u201d Reeve told The Washington Post. \u201cWe are a pluralistic society and we value religious pluralism. An attack against one religion is an attack against all religion.\u201d\n\n[Read the federal judge\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s new travel ban]\n\nThe scholars said that the federal government carried out a sustained campaign against church members, which included \u201cseveral measures\u201d to restrict Mormon immigration, which had grown because of a \u201csuccessful overseas proselytizing program.\u201d\n\n\u201cLatter-day Saints suffered mob violence countenanced by state officials, legal attacks by the federal government, and a crusade of discrimination waged against Mormon immigrants because of their religion,\u201d the court document said.\n\nAfter the religion was founded in 1830, Mormons were driven out of Missouri by hostile crowds and later endured the same fate in Illinois, where the faith\u2019s founder, Joseph Smith, was killed by a mob. The document acknowledges that some of the hostility was due to the Mormon practice of polygamy, which the church officially adopted in 1852 and \u201cpublicly abandoned\u201d in 1890.\n\nBut the animus toward Mormons existed before polygamy was embraced, the scholars argue. In many cases, it carried overtones of \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d\n\nMormons \u201cwere compared to the supposedly violent and lustful Turks and Arabs; the church\u2019s founder, Joseph Smith, was derisively referred to as the \u2018American Mohamet,\u2019\u201d the brief said. \u201cIn the same vein, critics of Mormonism remarked on the Latter-day Saints\u2019 \u2018dangerously\u2019 sympathetic attitude toward Muslims.\u201d\n\nRichard Bushman, an emeritus professor at Columbia University, who signed the brief, said in a statement that Mormons were \u201camong the most reviled\u201d when they came to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have to take a stand with those who flee to America as a refuge,\u201d he said.\n\nKathleen Flake, who teaches religious studies at the University of Virginia and signed the brief, said the \u201cMormon ban\u201d showed the lasting, negative impact such measures have on target groups.\n\n\u201cA Muslim ban under whatever name should alarm those who value freedom of conscience, America\u2019s \u2018first freedom,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nRead the court brief\n\nMore from Morning Mix\n\nWatch: Brazilian robbers pick on the wrong Mormon missionary\n\nWorried about Trump\u2019s travel ban, Canada\u2019s largest school district calls off U.S. trips\n\nShe was the United Methodists\u2019 first openly gay, married bishop.
