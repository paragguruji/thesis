But the ACLU and others continued to pursue the lawsuit over the first travel ban in hopes they could help people enter the United States who were improperly blocked.\n\n[The government now says 746 people were held due to the travel ban. Here\u2019s why that number keeps changing.]\n\nAs it stands, the Trump administration is allowed to impose a travel ban \u2014 but one that is significantly less onerous than what the president first envisioned, and it has been further watered down by court rulings.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June ruled that the ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees could take effect, but the government could not bar those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here or a job or a place at a U.S. school.\n\nThat state of affairs is temporary. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in October. Meanwhile, the parties are still hammering out details in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which heard arguments this week on which relatives and refugees could properly be kept out of the United States.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s lawsuit stemmed from Trump\u2019s first travel ban, which caused chaos at airports nationwide as people were detained and sometimes deported after they landed in the country.\n\nAlthough Trump would later revoke and revise that order, the ACLU pressed to get a complete accounting of those affected.\n\nGovernment officials have provided an evolving account of the impact of the first travel ban before it was halted by the court system.\n\nThe Monday after the ban was implemented, Trump declared on Twitter, \u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.\u201d Later, the Justice Department turned over to the ACLU a list of 746 names of people held, in any capacity, because of the executive order during a 26\u00bd hour stretch from Jan. 28 to Jan. 29.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security official said at the time that the difference in counts was likely attributable to officials taking different snapshots in time.\n\nThe latest list, which says it is for the period from Jan. 27 to Feb. 4, denotes more than 1,900 people who faced secondary screening. Dozens of those, according to the list, seem to have left the United States, either voluntarily or because the government forced them to.\n\nThe Justice Department referred questions on the figure to the Department of Homeland Security. A spokesman there said he was researching the matter.\n\nTo settle the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit, the government agreed to email those who had been turned away, providing them with an explanation of their rights and a list of free legal services. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the agreement was an important end to the litigation that first halted Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 although it was an unnecessarily hard fought battle.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those situations where the government should have just done it,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need months and months of wrangling in court.\u201d\n\nGelernt said the number of people held \u2014 even if briefly \u2014 was notable, calling into question the figures the government had previously offered. And Gelernt said the ACLU would press for more documents because it was not convinced that what they had was complete.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said in a statement that although the case had been \u201cmoot since March, when the President rescinded the original executive order,\u201d the government believed it had settled the matter \u201con favorable terms.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
