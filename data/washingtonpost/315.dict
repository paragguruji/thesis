Here are key moments from that news conference. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nHere are some of the basics. The new policy, set to go into effect in less than two weeks, will:\n\nImpose a 90-day ban on the issuance of new visas for citizens of six Muslim-majority countries\n\nBar entry to refugees from around the world for 120 days\n\nCap the total number of refugees accepted per year at 50,000, down from 110,000 under the Obama administration\n\nAllow certain groups of people to apply for waivers to the order, including those with significant work obligations\n\nSome readers may remember that the original ban barred entry to people from seven \u2014 not six \u2014 Muslim-majority countries. In the new version, Iraq was left off the list, which now comprises Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nDemocrats and civil liberties groups argued that the policy remains a thinly veiled Muslim ban. Trump\u2019s language in an email to supporters Monday didn\u2019t help counteract this view: He used the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d to describe his concerns with those six countries.\n\nThe administration said the policy is necessary as a \u201cpause\u201d so that officials can review how the system vets people trying to enter the United States.\n\nEARLY QUESTIONS FOR OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT BILL\n\nAfter seven years, House Republicans have finally released their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet even now, the most difficult part of the process lies ahead: It remains unclear whether the bill can pass the Senate and whether it will be acceptable to Trump, who has promised \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d under the new system.\n\nThe legislation would get rid of the ACA\u2019s requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, although people who go without coverage for two months or more would still face a penalty in the form of a temporary surcharge on their premiums.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 proposal would create a system of tax credits designed to encourage people to buy health plans. Notably, it would also start to wind down the ACA\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program for lower-income people in three years.\n\nPresident Trump, Vice President Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) keep saying a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will be released soon, but few details have been released so far. Here's what they've said. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s part of what is troubling a group of four Republican senators, who said Monday they would oppose a plan that doesn\u2019t protect people who became eligible for Medicaid under the ACA\u2019s expansion.\n\nIf all four of those senators oppose the bill when it goes to the upper chamber, it will fail to pass.\n\nThe plan emerged Monday without an assessment of how it would affect federal spending and the total number of people with health insurance \u2014 factors that will be vital for conservative and moderate Republicans, respectively, as they decide how to vote.\n\nLETTING THE TWEET SPEAK FOR ITSELF\n\n\n\nWe already know that President Trump doubles down when he\u2019s attacked.\n\nNow it\u2019s clear that the White House is following his example.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff on Monday did not try to back away from his provocative, unfounded claim from the weekend that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower before the November election.\n\nIn fact, the White House repeated and attempted to defend Trump\u2019s Twitter allegation while providing no supporting evidence.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks to members of the media outside the West Wing on Monday. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer, repeating calls for Congress to investigate, said there was \u201cno question that something happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to let the tweet speak for itself,\u201d Spicer told reporters. \u201cI think the president speaks very candidly.\u201d\n\nSince Trump posted his tweetstorm Saturday morning, neither he nor his aides have provided concrete facts to back up the assertion about wiretapping.\n\nSpicer declined to say whether the claim was based on anything more than conservative talk-radio chatter and a Breitbart News article that had circulated among White House staff.\n\nHe argued that Trump\u2019s accusations are supported by media reports, although a list of articles provided by the White House contained no such evidence.\n\nIt was clear that Trump\u2019s team had prepared for a day of negative coverage. The White House \u201cwent largely dark on Monday,\u201d our colleagues wrote, with Trump holding no public events and signing his new executive order on immigration without reporters present.\n\nFollow the author @eliseviebeck.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
