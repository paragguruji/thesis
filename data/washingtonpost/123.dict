Three powerful American leaders, targeting and dehumanizing some of the most vulnerable people on Earth. A picture of bullying. A picture of cruelty. A picture of national shame.\n\nIt sits in my head beside images of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, bewildered by the loss of their old lives, assets depleted, living (in some cases) eight to a room, exploited by human traffickers. Many families feel compelled to put their boys to work and their girls into early, forced marriages. \u201cMy home is all broken in Syria,\u201d a girl of 6 told me while coloring a picture of helicopters and bombs. Trump is a champion at punching down, but seldom this far.\n\nThis executive order is a security measure that very few actual security professionals would prioritize, given that refugees are some of the most carefully vetted people who enter the country. Meanwhile, the downside of (in effect) targeting foreigners by their religion is immediate and considerable \u2014 worrying American Muslims and embarrassing the United States\u2019 Muslim friends and allies in the world. When some radical cleric in, say, Central Asia, says, \u201cThe new American president hates Islam,\u201d he does not require a conspiracy theory to support his claim. And all of this may have been done with no security upside at all, given the utter incompetence with which the order was drafted and the likelihood that the courts will prevent its implementation.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s refugee ban is an affront to American values]\n\nTrump came to power promising that masterful leadership would replace the \u201cstupid\u201d kind. This action was malicious, counterproductive and inept \u2014 the half-baked work of amateurs who know little about security, little about immigration law and nothing about compassion.\n\n(Dalton Bennett,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Katherine Shaver,Monica Akhtar,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is more systematic thought, however, behind Trump\u2019s attempt to recast the United States\u2019 global role \u2014 presumably the guiding influence of his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. In his inaugural address, Trump asserted the \u201cright of all nations to put their own interests first\u201d and promised that \u201cwe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone.\u201d Trump\u2019s version of the United States is a normal nation, like the Netherlands or Ghana, concerned with its own borders and business, and generally indifferent to the \u201cway of life\u201d chosen by others. Our national identity \u2014 as for other nations \u2014 is ethnic and cultural. Trump\u2019s America is vaguely Christian. Vaguely 1950s. Vividly white.\n\nA number of policies emerge from these convictions: a walled country, a closed economy and highly restricted immigration. Traditional U.S. commitments \u2014 to the special relationship with Britain, to a strong and growing NATO and European Union, to the United States\u2019 Pacific security umbrella \u2014 seem up for grabs. The trumpet always calls retreat.\n\nEvery U.S. president since World War II has disagreed with the stunted and self-defeating view of the country now held by Trump. Over the past century \u2014 in some ways from the beginning \u2014 the United States has been a cheerfully abnormal nation. American identity (in this view) is not based mainly on blood or soil, but rather on the patriotic acceptance of a unifying creed. American leaders, Democratic and Republican, have believed that a world where the realm of freedom is growing is more prosperous and secure; a world where freedom is retreating is more dangerous. The reason is not mystical. Dictators tend to be belligerent. Governments accountable to their people are generally more peaceful.\n\n[Middle Eastern Christians are Trump\u2019s pawns]\n\nIt is the lesson of hard experience. The United States found \u2014 twice \u2014 that it could not avoid the bloody disorders of Europe by ignoring them. It found that a Pacific dominated by a single, hostile power is a direct threat to its economy and security. It found that Russian aggression in Europe is like Newton\u2019s First Law \u2014 moving until some force stops it.\n\nAnd the United States has often accepted refugees, reflecting its deepest values and building reserves of trust and respect. The Soviet Union or Cuba under Fidel Castro were not working out unique and special \u201cways of life.\u201d They were producing fleeing victims who would be imprisoned or murdered at home. It is in the United States\u2019 nature to offer at least some of them a home and refuge. The same should be true for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s victims, including the children of a broken country.\n\nThis is the difference a creed can make: When Ronald Reagan spoke on foreign policy, tyrants sat uneasy on their thrones and dissidents and refugees took heart. When Donald Trump speaks on foreign policy, tyrants rest easier and dissidents and refugees lose hope.\n\n(Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
