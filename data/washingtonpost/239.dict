(Elaine Thompson/AP)\n\nPresident Trump can blame his own rhetoric about Muslims for a slew of court rulings blocking his travel ban, including one decision late Wednesday in Hawaii where a federal judge extended his ban on the ban.\n\nAmong the reasons cited by Judge Derrick Watson in his original ruling in Hawaii was that Trump\u2019s \u201ccontemporaneous public statements\u201d \u2014 about keeping Muslims out of the U.S. \u2014 suggested that the travel restrictions \u201cwere issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously-neutral purpose.\u201d\n\nNow Trump\u2019s threats against particular \u201csanctuary cities\u201d during his campaign are coming back to haunt him in lawsuits challenging another executive order: The ultimatum threatening a cut-off of federal funding to cities that \u201cwillfully\u201d fail to cooperate with federal officers hunting down undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe latest example came in a suit brought by Seattle Wednesday challenging that executive order as unconstitutional.\n\nOrdinarily, Seattle would have a hard time getting a federal judge to even consider the merits of its claim because the courts require a showing of injury before they\u2019ll let a lawsuit proceed. Neither Seattle, nor any other city, has yet been specifically threatened with a cut-off of funds by the administration.\n\nIn its lawsuit, however, Seattle argues that Trump had Seattle in mind when he issued the order and that the city is indeed specifically threatened by the order. The evidence comes, Seattle says, from \u201cthe campaign trail.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cthe campaign trail,\u201d the city\u2019s suit says, \u201cTrump referenced a 2007 Seattle homicide in his dislike for sanctuary cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an interview with a Seattle radio station on August 29, 2016, Defendant Trump was asked about Seattle\u2019s sanctuary city policy,\u201d the suit says. \u201cHe responded that \u2018sanctuary cities are out \u2026 sanctuary cities are over.\u2019 He added that \u2018the federal government is going to have to get involved and they\u2019re going to have to get involved very sharply.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions speaks to the news media about sanctuary cities during a briefing at the White House in Washington. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais via AP)\n\nIn a speech in Everett, Wash., on August 30, 2016, the lawsuit says, \u201c\u2018Defendant Trump stated that we \u2018are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in,\u2019 and specifically referenced the Seattle area.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cexecutive order creates irresolvable uncertainty surrounding whether federal funds that currently benefit all Seattle residents will be cut off if the city is deemed a \u2018sanctuary jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeattle expects to receive $150 million in federal funds this year, including $2.6 million in grants from the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cSeattle will not be bullied by this White House or this administration and today we are taking legal action against President Trump\u2019s unconstitutional order,\u201d Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement announcing the suit.\n\nSeattle is one of at least three dozen cities that have brought suit, individually or jointly, challenging the sanctuary cities executive order. San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Oakland, Berkeley, Calif., Santa Ana, Calif., and Denver are among the plaintiffs.\n\nThe suit by the city and county of San Francisco, which is set for a hearing on April 14, also threw Trump\u2019s words back at him to justify its standing to sue.\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d the suit argued, \u201cin a written campaign speech then-candidate Donald J. Trump gave on August 31, 2016, he expressly referred to San Francisco as a Sanctuary City.\u201d\n\nIt cited as well a Trump interview with Breitbart News in which, specifically referencing San Francisco, he called sanctuary cities \u201ca safe-haven for criminals \u2026 It\u2019s just unacceptable. We\u2019ll be looking at sanctuary cities very hard.\u201d\n\n[How sanctuary cities work, and how Trump\u2019s executive order might affect them]\n\nWhether these and other arguments made by the lawsuits will prove convincing to the federal judges considering them remains to be seen.\n\nThe definition of a \u201csanctuary city\u201d varies from place to place, but usually entails an unwillingness, sometimes enshrined in municipal law, to cooperate with the federal government by turning over names of undocumented immigrants encountered by city officials, including police, in the course of their duties or by holding them in custody so that federal agents could come and get them.\n\nSeattle considers itself a sanctuary city because of an ordinance barring city employees from inquiring about a person\u2019s immigration status, unless required by law or court order, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nThe plaintiffs generally make two arguments in support of their claim of unconstitutionality.\n\nOne is that by placing a burden on cities to act in assistance of immigration agents the federal government is \u201ccommandeering\u201d or effectively conscripting state and local officials \u201cto enforce federal law,\u201d as San Francisco says in its suit.\n\nThey cite as precedent a 1997 Supreme Court opinion involving gun control written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Trump\u2019s model Supreme Court justice. The federal gun law, the \u201cBrady Bill,\u201d obligated police across the country to perform background checks on gun purchasers until a federal system of checking was up and running.\n\nThe Scalia opinion in the case, called Printz v. U.S., declared this to be federal \u201ccommandeering\u201d of local officials in violation the nation\u2019s basic structure of federalism and state sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWe have the law on our side,\u201d Murray, the Seattle mayor, said. \u201cThe federal government cannot compel our police department to enforce federal immigration law and cannot use our federal dollars to coerce Seattle into turning our backs on our immigrant and refugee communities. We simply won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThey also cite the opinion of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the \u201cObamacare case\u201d (National Federal of Independent Business v. Sebelius) declaring it unconstitutional to put a \u201cgun to the head\u201d of states by threatening to cut off massive amounts of money \u2014 in this case, Medicaid funds to those states that opted out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion in health care coverage.\n\nWhether the judges in the cases address those claims, however, will depend in part on their answers to the threshold question: Do the cities, before the government has threatened to cut off any funding to them, have standing to sue.\n\nAnd that may very well depend on Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nMore from Morning Mix\n\nAppeals court judges rebuke Trump for \u2018personal attacks\u2019 on judiciary, \u2018intimidation\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s talk \u2014 \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 \u2018Islam hates us\u2019 \u2014 comes back to bite him in court again\n\nCalifornia chief justice blasts immigration crackdown, says rule of law is \u2018being challenged\u2019", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-30", "type": "article"}
