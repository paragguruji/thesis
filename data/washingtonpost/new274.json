She later said she misspoke. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nKellyanne Conway has taken \u201calternative facts\u201d to a new level.\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, the counselor to the president defended President Trump\u2019s travel ban related to seven majority-Muslim countries. At one point, Conway made a reference to two Iraqi refugees whom she described as the masterminds behind \u201cthe Bowling Green massacre.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know that because it didn\u2019t get covered,\u201d Conway said.\n\nThe Bowling Green massacre didn\u2019t get covered because it didn\u2019t happen. There has never been a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky., carried out by Iraqi refugees or anyone else.\n\nIt appeared initially that Conway was referring to two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green who were arrested in 2011 and eventually sentenced to federal prison for attempting to send weapons and money to al-Qaeda in Iraq for the purpose of killing U.S. soldiers, according to a statement from the Justice Department.\n\nOn Friday morning, she acknowledged that with a tweet:\n\nBowling Green city officials said Friday in a statement that \u201cwhile in 2011, two Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green were arrested for attempting to provide money and weapons to terrorists in Iraq, there was no massacre in Bowling Green.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand during a live interview how one can misspeak,\u201d Mayor Bruce Wilkerson said of Conway\u2019s remarks, \u201cand we appreciate the clarification.\u201d\n\n[Fact Checker: Kellyanne Conway\u2019s claim of a \u2018Bowling Green massacre\u2019]\n\nThe arrests in Bowling Green were indeed covered, contrary to what Conway initially said. A Lexis search of major papers turned up about 90 news stories. That\u2019s not counting TV coverage, as in the ABC news story she attached to her tweet.\n\nI was the @bgdailynews' city editor when the Bowling Green Massacre didn't happen. \u2014 Daniel Pike (@DPikeBGDN) February 3, 2017\n\nWe couldn't cover the Bowling Green Massacre because it didn't happen, but this newspaper has written close to 100 stories about that case. \u2014 Daniel Pike (@DPikeBGDN) February 3, 2017\n\nAs a result of the Bowling Green investigation, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, was sentenced to life in federal prison. Waad Ramadan Alwan, 31, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison, followed by a life term of supervised release.\n\nBoth men pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges and admitted to having taken part in attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq, not in Bowling Green.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Justice Department said in a Jan. 29, 2013, statement:\n\nHammadi and Alwan both admitted, in FBI interviews that followed waiver of their Miranda rights, to participation in the purported material support operations in Kentucky, and both provided the FBI details of their prior involvement in insurgent activities while living in Iraq. Both men believed their activities in Kentucky were supporting AQI. Alwan admitted participating in IED attacks against U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and Hammadi admitted to participating in 10 to 11 IED attacks as well as shooting at a U.S. soldier in an observation tower. Court documents filed in this case reveal that the Bowling Green office of the FBI\u2019s Louisville Division initiated an investigation of Alwan in which they used a confidential human source (CHS). The CHS met with Alwan and recorded their meetings and conversations beginning in August 2010. The CHS represented to Alwan that he was working with a group to ship money and weapons to Mujahadeen in Iraq. From September 2010 through May 2011, Alwan participated in ten separate operations to send weapons and money that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Between October 2010 and January 2011, Alwan drew diagrams of multiple types of IEDs and instructed the CHS how to make them. In January 2011, Alwan recruited Hammadi, a fellow Iraqi national living in Bowling Green, to assist in these material support operations. Beginning in January 2011 and continuing until his arrest in late May 2011, Hammadi participated with Alwan in helping load money and weapons that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq.\n\nConway also reiterated claims from Trump that his refugee policy is similar to \u201cwhat President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\u201d Conway said it was \u201cbrand new information\u201d to people that Obama enacted a \u201csix-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program.\u201d Breitbart also reported this week that \u201cObama suspended Iraq refugee program for six months over terrorism fears in 2011.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post reported, that was not the case. Obama administration officials told The Post that there was never a point when Iraqi resettlement was stopped or banned. In the aftermath of the arrests of the two Iraqis living in Kentucky, the Obama administration imposed more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees, and the new screening procedures created a dramatic slowdown in visa approvals.\n\n[Trump\u2019s facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to Obama\u2019s in 2011]\n\nState Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011, The Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler reported. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. One news report said the \u201cpace of visa approvals\u201d had \u201cslowed to a crawl,\u201d indicating some were still being approved.\n\nConway\u2019s interview was by no means the first time the arrests of the two Iraqis in Bowling Green had been politicized as support for blocking refugees from reaching the United States.\n\nIn December 2015, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) released a dramatic campaign video ad featuring images and video footage of the two Iraqi nationals, while criticizing then-rivals in the presidential race Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). In the 90-second ad, the faces of Alwan and Hammadi are featured with pounding, dismal music, establishing that the men were \u201cwelcomed into America, given public housing and public assistance \u2014 as refugees.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s comments made the front page of the local newspaper in Bowling Green.\n\nCongratulations to the Bowling Green Daily News (@bgdailynews) for this front page and one-word headline. cc @DrMarioRGarcia pic.twitter.com/DRgLWRpPzb \u2014 BGrueskin (@BGrueskin) February 3, 2017\n\nThey were also shared widely on social media.\n\nOne journalist tweeted that the American Civil Liberties Union had created a \u201cBowling Green Massacre Victims Fund,\u201d which actually redirected to the ACLU\u2019s website.\n\nACLU has created a \u201cBowling Green Massacre Victims Fund\u201d\u2014which redirects to donate to the ACLU Trolling level: high https://t.co/XbX4WlIPka pic.twitter.com/Nwe04sB3eh \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 3, 2017\n\nBut the organization said it wasn\u2019t responsible.\n\nThe \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d was the No. 1 topic trending on Twitter, and Conway\u2019s interview prompted many to share memories of where they were \u201cwhen the Bowling Green Massacre didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBut on a more serious note, Chelsea Clinton called the massacre \u201ccompletely fake\u201d and urged people not to \u201cmake up attacks.\u201d\n\nVery grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack \u2026or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017\n\nThen Conway called her out, tweeting, \u201c @ ChelseaClinton & others, you can\u2019t \u2018invent\u2019 quality candidates either.
