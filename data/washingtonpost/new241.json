IRAP, the Fourth Circuit litigation about the validity of his administration\u2019s six-country travel ban. On the schedule that the United States proposes, the case would be briefed over the summer and argued this fall at the Supreme Court.\n\nBut commentators such as Marty Lederman and Mark Tushnet have suggested that the case either will soon be moot, or could be made moot without the entry ban ever going into effect. That might be right, but I\u2019m not so sure, and because I found it tricky I thought I\u2019d think through the possibilities here.\n\nPossibility One: The challenges will become moot on June 14, because the text of the order says that its effective date is March 16, and June 14 is 90 days after March 16. This assumes that the order\u2019s start date and duration are unchanged by any of the court orders against it. This is Marty\u2019s position. Possibility Two: The order\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d has been delayed by the court orders preventing it from going to effect. The order will become moot 90 days after it goes into effect, so the order will not become moot as long as it is stayed. Possibility Three: The order\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d is unchanged by the court orders, but it will not expire until it has been in effect for 90 days. The upshot is the same as in Possibility Two: The order will not become moot as long as the entry ban is stayed.\n\nMarty argues that the answer is Possibility One:\n\nSection 2(c) of the Order provides that \u201cthe entry into the United States of nationals of [the six designated] countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order.\u201d And Section 14 of the Order specifically provides that the \u201ceffective date\u201d of the Order was 12:01 a.m. on March 16. Accordingly, the E.O. itself provides that the suspension prescribed in Section 2(c) ends at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, June 14, whether or not any courts have enjoined its implementation in the interim.\n\nBut I am not so sure. I am inclined to think that Possibility Three and Possibility Two are both plausible, and that Possibility Three is probably the most natural interpretation of the order. Here\u2019s that reading:\n\nThe order\u2019s effective date is March 16. Section 2(c) of the order says that entry of designated nationals will \u201cbe suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order.\u201d Normally, that would result in the order lasting for 90 days, because a 90-day suspension normally takes 90 days. But because the relevant parts of the order have been preempted by a federal court judgment, it will take longer than 90 calendar days for the 90-day suspension to run. Or to put it more simply: The order will last until it has done what it says it is going to do, namely suspend entry for 90 days.\n\nI think Marty\u2019s reading would be much stronger if the order contained an explicit expiration date of \u201cJune 14.\u201d And it would be at least somewhat stronger, if not as much, if the order said something like \u201cthis order shall expire 90 days after its effective date.\u201d But the order doesn\u2019t quite do either of these things. Instead it announces that entry is suspended for 90 days, and so it is most natural to think that the order expires when entry has indeed been suspended for 90 days. No suspension, no expiration.\n\nNow, Marty is also quite right to point out that the United States seems to have implicitly taken his position in at least one legal filing. But until we know more, I am not convinced that is dispositive, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be the United States\u2019 position now, and I doubt that the filing satisfies the requirements for something like judicial estoppel. I\u2019m not positive about any of that, but it isn\u2019t obvious to me that the cases will all become moot in 12 days.\n\nFinally, one other set of things that puzzles me, apart from the best reading of the order, is what kind of standards apply to this mootness question:\n\nShould we think of this as a question of textual interpretation, analogous to interpretation of an agency regulation? And if so, does an analogy to Auer deference apply, giving the president\u2019s deference as to the meaning of his own order?\n\nIs this more like a \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d case, where the question is whether it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that the suspension \u201ccould not reasonably be expected to recur\u201d after June 14?\n\nOr is the order itself a distraction for purposes of justiciability? Perhaps the real mootness question is whether the United States keeps asserting its willingness to block entry after June 14, order or no order. On this view, Marty\u2019s textual analysis of the order might be relevant to the lawfulness of that executive action under Section 212(f) of the INA, without controlling the justiciability question.\n\nI suspect we\u2019ll see further briefing on this question, and perhaps the court will simply add this mootness question to the case if it hears argument in the fall.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "ban", "moot", "cases", "days", "date", "possibility", "orders", "united", "entry", "order", "90", "effective"], "summary": "But commentators such as Marty Lederman and Mark Tushnet have suggested that the case either will soon be moot, or could be made moot without the entry ban ever going into effect.\nPossibility Two: The order\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d has been delayed by the court orders preventing it from going to effect.\nThe order will become moot 90 days after it goes into effect, so the order will not become moot as long as it is stayed.\nThe upshot is the same as in Possibility Two: The order will not become moot as long as the entry ban is stayed.\nHere\u2019s that reading:The order\u2019s effective date is March 16."}
