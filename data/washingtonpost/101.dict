(Elaine Cromie/Detroit Free Press via AP)\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, President Trump signed into law this week a series of executive orders that have sent reverberations around the world. Making good on some of his most controversial campaign promises, Trump started on Wednesday the process of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. On Friday, he instituted a ban on refugees and halted admission to all foreign nationals \u2014 including those with visas \u2014 of seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nBy early Saturday, refugees were being detained at the border, and some legal permanent residents were turned away. In short order, massive crowds demanding that the policy be revoked rallied at the airports of many of the nation\u2019s largest cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston.\n\nIt is clear that Trump\u2019s policies reflect a sea change in the American approach to national security \u2014 but do they \u201cmake Americans safe again?\u201d\n\nOur research suggests they could do exactly the opposite. By dehumanizing minority group members in word and deed, Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies may promote the very actions that they purport to prevent.\n\nDuring the presidential primary process, we collected data from two large samples of several-hundred Americans online. We assessed their political leanings, their attitudes about Mexican immigrants and Muslims, and their support for several of Trump\u2019s actual border policies (taken directly from his campaign website).\n\nSpecifically, we assessed participants\u2019 overt dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims, first by asking Americans to place these groups where they thought they belonged on the popular \u201cAscent of Man\u201d diagram representing human evolution, and second by asking how well they thought Mexican immigrants and Muslims were characterized by animalistic traits such as being \u201csavage,\u201d \u201cprimitive,\u201d \u201clacking in self-control\u201d and \u201cunsophisticated.\u201d\n\nOur work, published last month in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, revealed that Americans consistently rated Mexican immigrants and Muslims as less human than average Americans. Furthermore, reported levels of dehumanization strongly predicted support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including the plan to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and the proposal to ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.\n\nSuggesting the unique importance of dehumanization, these associations remained when we controlled for participants\u2019 political conservatism and their dislike of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. We also observed that support for Trump as a candidate was more strongly linked to dehumanization of these groups than support for any of the other Republican candidates. It wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nOur work also suggests that the consequences of dehumanization do not stop with the policies it promotes. There are consequences, too, to making others feel dehumanized.\n\nTo examine the ramifications of dehumanization for its targets, we sampled Latino and Muslim residents of the U.S. online and asked them to report how dehumanized they felt by Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and Americans in general. Our findings revealed that our samples of Latinos and Muslims felt heavily dehumanized, and that this had important consequences: The more dehumanized they felt, the more likely they were to support violent over nonviolent forms of collective protest, and the less likely they were to report suspicious activity in their neighborhoods, potentially related to terrorism, to the FBI. Here again, these associations remained even after controlling for feelings of being disliked and for participants\u2019 levels of political conservatism.\n\nThese findings highlight the self-reinforcing dangers dehumanization can create. When one group dehumanizes and aggresses against another, those on the receiving end may come to feel dehumanized and reciprocate the hostility. This could then be interpreted by the first group as further evidence of their lack of humanity. Highlighting the potential for such processes to provoke reciprocal cycles of hostility, Iran responded Sunday to Trump\u2019s immigration ban by announcing that there would be \u201cproportionate legal, consular and political consequences.\u201d\n\nBy insinuating that Muslims and Mexicans are less \u201cevolved\u201d than \u201cus,\u201d and by putting forward blanket measures to keep \u201cthem\u201d out at all costs, Trump risks framing Mexican immigrants and Muslims not as human peers to be reasoned with, but as an undifferentiated, threatening mass to be neutralized.\n\nReflecting on Trump\u2019s proposals a few months ago, then-President Barack Obama remarked, \u201cThat\u2019s not the America we want. It doesn\u2019t reflect our democratic ideals.\u201d Although the election results reveal important disagreements about what people want America to be, there is broad agreement across the political divide about the desire to keep Americans secure. For that reason alone, everyone should be troubled that our findings lend empirical backing to the rest of Obama\u2019s statement: \u201cIt will make us less safe.\u201d\n\nNour Kteily is assistant professor of management and organizations at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nEmile Bruneau is research associate at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
