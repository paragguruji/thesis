The brief says Trump's executive order represents a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the U.S. and inflicts harm on American companies. (Reuters)\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nSilicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration.\n\nOn Sunday night, technology giants Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber and many others filed a legal brief opposing the administration\u2019s contentious entry ban. The move represents a rare coordinated action across a broad swath of the industry \u2014 about a hundred companies in total \u2014 and demonstrates the depth of animosity toward the Trump order.\n\nThe amicus brief was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is expected to rule within a few days on an appeal by the administration after a federal judge in Seattle issued late Friday a temporary restraining order putting the entry ban on hold. The brief comes after a week of nationwide protests against the plan \u2014 as well as a flurry of activity in Silicon Valley, a region that sees immigration as central to its identity as an innovation hub.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended View Photos After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.

Amazon appears to have stayed out. Amazon's founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, recently said that he supported the lawsuit filed by the Washington state's attorney general against the executive order on immigration and refugees.\n\nAn Amazon official said Monday that the state's attorney general preferred that the company not join the brief since the firm is a witness in the original lawsuit.\n\nThe filing says that the entry ban, which barred individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States for at least 90 days and suspended the U.S. refugee program, is discriminatory.\n\n\u201cThe Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years,\u201d the brief said. \" \u2026 The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world\u2019s best employees. It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies\u2019 ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe filing argues that immigration and economic growth are \u201cintimately tied\u201d and that the order would damage the United States' ability to attract the world\u2019s talent.\n\n\u201cImmigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, including Apple, Kraft, Ford, General Electric, AT&T, Google, McDonald\u2019s, Boeing, and Disney,\u201d it said.
