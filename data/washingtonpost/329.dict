Here's what the order says. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\n[UPDATE 1/31\n\nCommentary about this post was unusually vigorous. Let me try to respond. I asked a question: \u201cDo you have an alternative explanation [other than that it was driven by Trump\u2019s business dealings] of why, say, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are exempted from the ban? What is it?\u201d Many of had an alternative \u2013 the one also provided by Press Secretary Spicer over the weekend: \u201cthe seven countries that we\u2019ve identified [were those] that, in fact, the Obama administration had previously identified needed further travel restrictions.\u201d\n\nThe reference, as many of you pointed out, was to the list of 7 countries affected by President Obama\u2019s 2015 Executive Order. That Order amended the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the United States without obtaining visas (and gives Americans reciprocal privileges in those countries). The Order removed from the Visa Waiver Program dual nationals who were citizens of four countries (Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Syria), or anyone who had recently traveled to those countries; three more countries (Libya, Somalia, and Yemen), were added to the list in early 2016.\n\nSo in the spirit of reasoned discussion, I agree: I asked for a plausible alternative explanation, and that is a plausible alternative explanation. I appreciate the efforts of those who took the time to write.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd explanation, to be sure. I thought a major thrust of Trump\u2019s view on anti-terrorism was that Obama had done a terrible job and made a real hash of things. To simply pluck the list from Obama\u2019s list \u2013 to say \u201cThe Obama Administration designated these as the bad guys, so we\u2019ll take their word for it\u201d \u2013 as part of a measure vastly broader in scope than the one for which the original list was prepared, and one in which lives, actually, are at stake, strikes me as odd (though I concede: not impeachable, standing alone).\n\nSo where does this leave us? Now there are two alternative explanations, both consistent with the facts. Which is true?\n\nThis is a problem, as the \u201calternative facts\u201d debacle of the first week illustrated, that we will be facing over and over again in the coming years. A number of commenters said: The President, and his explanation for his actions, deserve respect.\n\nI disagree. I think he has forfeited, by the manner in which he has consistently manipulated the truth, that respect. It may well be that he just lifted the list from the one on the shelf; it may well be that he is in hock to a Saudi bank and the Saudi royal family for a gazillion dollars, and that influenced his decision. We don\u2019t know.\n\nAnd that, of course, is the problem. I recognize that Trump\u2019s plan for dealing with his conflicts of interest is already old news \u2013 but we should not let it disappear from view. He has information about his business dealings that he has chosen not to share with the American people so that we can judge his actions accordingly, and I don\u2019t think he is able to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities until he does so.]\n\nMy co-bloggers Ilya Somin, Jon Adler, Orin Kerr and Will Baude \u2014 not to mention Ben Wittes\u2019s withering critique over at Lawfare \u2014 have already dissected President Trump\u2019s executive order (misleadingly titled \u201cProtecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals\u201d) (full text here) and addressed many of its more appalling features, including its cruelty, ineffectiveness and the truly staggering incompetence with which it was drafted.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Wittes correctly points to the absence of any \u201crational relationship\u201d between the countries targeted by the ban and \u201cany expected counterterrorism goods.\u201d\n\nThe 9/11 hijackers, after all, didn\u2019t come from Somalia or Syria or Iran; they came from Saudi Arabia and Egypt and a few other countries not affected by the order.\n\n[Greg Sargent: Trump\u2019s refugee ban could get much, much worse. That\u2019s why it must be stopped.]\n\nBut there could be, it turns out, an explanation for why some countries are inside, and others outside, the ban. It has nothing to do with counterterrorism. You should take a quick look at this graphic (and accompanying documentation) put together by Bloomberg News. Here\u2019s the list of predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East covered by Trump\u2019s order:\n\nIran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of predominantly Muslim countries where the Trump Organization has done business:\n\nSaudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan.\n\nWhat a coincidence; there\u2019s no overlap. The places where the Trump Organization has done business are exempted from the ban.\n\nEven Saudi Arabia, for goodness\u2019 sake! The one country we know for certain has allowed, if it did not actively encourage, emigrants who attacked the United States on 9/11. But Trump has business interests in Saudi Arabia, and a guy shouldn\u2019t have to give up his business interests just because he\u2019s going into \u201cpublic service,\u201d now should he?\n\nThis adds up to malfeasance of the highest order. Can we now stop the debate about whether Trump\u2019s business interests might influence his policymaking, and move on to the more important question, which is how do we protect ourselves from this despot and start the work of getting him removed from office?\n\n[Update: Some commenters, fairly, suggested that there could be alternative explanations for the inclusion/exclusion, and that this doesn\u2019t, standing alone, constitute malfeasance. Fair enough \u2014 perhaps the answer to the question I posed in the headline is: \u201cWe\u2019re not sure \u2014 but it sure as hell could be. But we can\u2019t really know without knowing more about Trump\u2019s business activities, which he has continued to withhold from the American people.\u201d So I\u2019ll modify my call for impeachment, and ask instead, in the face of potential conflicts that can cause untold misery and hardship for many thousands of people who are among the most vulnerable on the planet, he step down until he releases all of his financial information so we can figure out for ourselves whether or not our fears are justified.\n\nAnd I could have been clearer: I don\u2019t think that the possible use of presidential power for personal gain is the only \u2013 or even the most serious \u2013 problem with this Executive Order; other commentators, though, in the postings cited and elsewhere, have already covered its many other repellent (and potentially impeachment-worthy) characteristics.]\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Trump said that from now on, \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\u201d\n\nThat was, not to put too fine a point on it, bulls\u2014. Some will be made to benefit Trump.\n\nI know some VC readers still count themselves among Trump\u2019s supporters, and are interested in engaging in serious discussion of his presidency. In that spirit, I\u2019d ask you: Do you have an alternative explanation of why, say, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are exempted from the ban? What is it? Or do you think that Trump allowed business interests to interfere with his public policymaking, but you don\u2019t think that constitutes an impeachable offense?", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
