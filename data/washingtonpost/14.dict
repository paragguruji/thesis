(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nPresident Trump weighed in Friday on an attack in London by a \u201closer terrorist\u201d and used the episode to call for an expansion of his travel ban that has temporarily blocked entry into the United States for citizens of six Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s assessment followed news of an explosion in a London subway car during the morning rush hour that injured at least 18 commuters and was labeled a terrorist attack by police.\n\n\u201cAnother attack in London by a loser terrorist,\u201d Trump said in early morning tweets.\n\n[Explosion in London subway declared \u2018terrorist incident\u2019 by police]\n\n\u201cThese are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\u201d Trump added, referring to the police force in London.\n\nBritish police have arrested two men in connection with the homemade bomb that went off on the London subway and injured at least 30 people on Sept. 15. (Joyce Lee,Karla Adam/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump had been briefed by his security advisers, and what information, if any, they provided about the identity of the assailants. Neither the Metropolitan Police nor the British government have said anything publicly beyond describing the detonation as a suspected terrorist attack.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Trump said: \u201cLoser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner. The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a question about what information Trump used to craft his tweets.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tweets during a television interview, British Prime Minister Theresa May said: \u201cI never think it\u2019s helpful for anyone to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nMay\u2019s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, was more blunt in his criticism of Trump, writing on Twitter: \u201cTrue or not \u2014 and I'm sure he doesn't know \u2014 this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.\u201d\n\nDuring a brief appearance in the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump called the attacks \u201ca terrible thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt keeps going and going, and we have to be very smart, and we have to be very, very tough \u2014 perhaps we\u2019re not nearly tough enough,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said he had been briefed on the attack and told reporters he plans to call May.\n\nTrump's travel ban blocked the entry of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Officials have said the 90-day period will expire in less than two weeks, and Trump will face a critical decision about the ban's future.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been working on a report about countries that U.S. authorities say do not provide adequate information to vet their travelers. That report could inform a more expansive measure that bars people from coming to the United States.\n\nTrump's tweet seemed to envision such a \u201clarger, tougher\u201d ban, though he also said the measure needed to be \u201cmore specific\u201d \u2014 which might indicate the White House is not inclined to bar people merely because of their nationality. The Homeland Security report is expected to be presented to the White House in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on whether the travel ban is legal on Oct. 10. But by that time, a critical portion of the directive will have expired, and a new measure might be in place. A person familiar with the ongoing discussions said a new ban might make the Supreme Court case moot, but could spark new legal challenges. A permanent ban, in particular, might be harder to defend in court, the person said. It is also possible, though unlikely, that Trump could merely let the ban expire.\n\nIn a later tweet on Friday morning, Trump took credit for progress by his administration in combating the Islamic State terrorist group, asserting that more had been done in the past nine months than under Obama\u2019s eight years in office.\n\n\u201cMust be proactive & nasty!\u201d Trump wrote.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-15", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
