(Chris J Ratcliffe/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\nThe stoic determination and decency of the British people and their leaders were on full display in the hours after the latest horrific terrorist rampage. The Brits fought back, launching drinking glasses and chairs at the savages who attacked them. The police acted with lightning-fast precision, killing the three assailants within eight minutes of the emergency call. And, God Bless him, a man returned to the bar where he experienced Saturday\u2019s horror \u2014 to pay his bill and tip. Civilization is not going to be driven out of Britain by three or three hundred killers.\n\nMeanwhile \u2014 and it pains me to write this \u2014 our president acted like a clod, a heartless and dull-witted thug in sending out a series of tweets. He \u2014 commander in chief and leader of the Free World \u2014 first retweeted an unverified, unofficial Drudge headline about the unfolding terrorist attack. Then he aimed to bolster his Muslim travel ban (which is not supposed to be a Muslim travel ban). \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d (Aside from the inappropriateness of President Trump\u2019s tweet, he fails to grasp that the courts in these cases are reaffirming our rights against an overreaching, discriminatory edict.)\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on June 4 commented on President Trump's tweets calling for a travel ban and criticizing the mayor of London after an attack in Britain's capital left seven people dead the day before. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter receiving blowback for that obnoxious missive, he tweeted out, \u201cWhatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there \u2013 WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!\u201d But then he decided to slam the mayor of the city attacked, who had calmly warned his fellow Londoners: \u201cLondoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. There\u2019s no reason to be alarmed.\u201d Trump took the second part out of context and responded viciously, \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!'\u201d (The mayor, of course, was telling them not to be alarmed by the heightened police presence.) Trump was not done, however, inanely tweeting, \u201cDo you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That\u2019s because they used knives and a truck!\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a vigil at Potters Fields Park in London on June 5, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the London Bridge attack \"cowardly,\" saying to the perpetrators, \"We will defeat you.\" (Reuters)\n\nOne is prompted to ask if he is off his rocker. But this is vintage Trump \u2014 impulsive and cruel, without an ounce of class or human decency. His behavior no longer surprises us, but it should offend and disturb us, first, that he remains the face and voice of America in the world and, second, that his fans hoot and holler, seeing this as inconsequential or acceptable conduct. We wound up with this president because millions of Republicans could not prioritize character, decency and overall fitness to serve over their mundane and frankly petty partisan wish list (28 percent top marginal tax rate!). Self-appointed religious leaders fail to see that this soullessness \u2014 not the dreaded liberal elite who insist on saying \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d or refuse to countenance discrimination against gay customers \u2014 is a threat to the moral fiber of a democracy that requires a modicum of common sense and human decency to function.\n\n1 of 39 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Britain probes attack in central London that left 7 dead and dozens injured View Photos London Bridge and nearby Borough Market were the site of chaos after a van plowed into pedestrians and attackers with knives went into the crowd.

Far worse, however, is his appalling character, which accelerates the erosion of democratic norms and social cohesion a diverse democracy requires. In instances like this, those who would lecture us on President Obama\u2019s under-appreciation of America\u2019s unique place in human history or proclaim that they simply had to vote for Trump because Hillary Clinton was some sort of monster are exposed as fools or hypocrites or both.\n\nThe London attacks bring out the best in Britain and in Western leaders on the European continent; it brings out the worst in Trump and his followers. The former protect the soul of Western civilization; the latter drive a stake through the animating ideas that make America special.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-04", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["america", "travel", "trump", "tweets", "ban", "decency", "bridge", "trumps", "london", "mayor", "president", "embarrasses", "attack"], "summary": "People leave the scene of a terrorist attack on London Bridge in central London on June 3.\nThen he aimed to bolster his Muslim travel ban (which is not supposed to be a Muslim travel ban).\nThat\u2019s because they used knives and a truck!\u201dSpeaking at a vigil at Potters Fields Park in London on June 5, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the London Bridge attack \"cowardly,\" saying to the perpetrators, \"We will defeat you.\"\nCaption London Bridge and nearby Borough Market were the site of chaos after a van plowed into pedestrians and attackers with knives went into the crowd.\nJune 5, 2017 People attend a vigil at Potters Field Park in London to remember the victims of the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market."}
