(Susan Walsh/Associated Press)\n\nA U.S. senator who served in the Army and lost her legs in Iraq challenged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday to explain why he stood next to President Trump last week at the Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, as Trump signed a controversial temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying it contradicts Mattis\u2019s comments before he joined the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said in a letter that the signing ceremony in the Pentagon was a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to Muslim members of the U.S. military. She took special exception to Trump\u2019s holding the event in the Hall of Heroes, a room recognizing the valor and sacrifice of service members who have received the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for combat valor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nauseating to me,\u201d she said in a brief interview. \u201cI was absolutely appalled, first of all, that it happened at all but, in particular, that the Medal of Honor was used as a backdrop.\u201d\n\n[Among veterans, raw responses to Trump\u2019s effort to block refugees and others from Muslim countries]\n\nDuckworth, one of the few members of Congress to have been wounded while serving in the U.S. military, urged Mattis, a retired Marine general, to use his \u201cconsiderable position of power and many years of military experience\u201d to impress upon Trump \u201cthe folly\u201d of his new policy and urge him to repeal it. The order suspended the admission of all refugees to the United States for 120 days and banned for 90 days the entry of citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, prompting criticism that the Trump administration was almost entirely targeting Muslims.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the order as a necessary measure to protect the United States against terrorism, and argued that it is not a ban on Muslims. It includes countries the Obama administration had identified as potential spots from which terrorism could originate but leaves out other countries with connections to previous attacks on the United States, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Former president Barack Obama on Monday rejected any suggestion that Trump\u2019s order was similar to the actions of his administration.\n\n[Who is affected by Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nMattis and other senior U.S. officials outside the White House were caught by surprise by the order. Until a few hours before the event, senior defense officials, including Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were preparing for Trump to use the Hall of Heroes to sign one executive order aimed at improving military readiness and another calling for a 30-day review of U.S. policy against the Islamic States, according to U.S. officials. Instead, Trump signed the military readiness order and the travel ban, and handed the travel ban order to Mattis on camera.\n\nBefore signing the orders, Trump said in the Hall of Heroes that the room was \u201csacred,\u201d and added that the \u201csoul of our nation lives between these walls.\u201d\n\n\n\nSenator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) participates in a mock swearing-in with Vice President Biden during the opening day of the 115th Congress on Capitol Hill on Jan. 3. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson, Laura Seal, said Tuesday that the Pentagon would respond to Duckworth\u2019s letter. On Monday, a senior Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, declined repeatedly to address whether Mattis was aware of what was in the executive order before it was signed.\n\nDuckworth said in an interview that she considers Mattis \u201ca man of integrity with a spine of steel,\u201d but she wants answers to how and why he came to find himself next to Trump as the travel ban was signed. It\u2019s a problem, she said, to have the Pentagon chief so closely associated with the measure, considering how many Muslim-majority countries in which the U.S. military operates.\n\n\u201cThe visual was very clear,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cPresident Trump signed this measure into law in the Hall of Heroes \u2014 and General Mattis was standing next to him smiling.\u201d\n\nBefore the election, Duckworth noted, Mattis said during an interview with Politico that Trump\u2019s talk of banning Muslims was \u201ccausing us great damage right now.\u201d\n\nIn her letter, Duckworth requested that Defense Department detail how Trump\u2019s order affects the war against the Islamic State, and provide an assessment of its impact on U.S. military and civilian personnel and partnerships in the region. She also requested an estimate for how many local interpreters who wanted to come to the United States will be affected by Trump\u2019s order and an estimate for how many interpreters have partnered with the United States since 2001.\n\nDavis said Monday that the Pentagon has begun compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the United States since the U.S. invasion in 2003 for special consideration under Trump\u2019s executive order. The effort did not begin until after the temporary ban was signed.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that 872 refugees will be allowed to enter the United States this week despite the new order. They are now considered \u201calready in transit\u201d and would have faced \u201cundue hardship\u201d if they were denied entry into the United States, U.S. officials said.\n\nRelated content:\n\nPentagon, caught by surprise by Trump\u2019s travel ban, pushes for some Iraqis to get special consideration\n\nJihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory\n\nTrump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it could not have prevented", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/dlamothe", "type": "article"}
