(Marcio Jose Sanchez, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration says new measures to restrict immigration are required to keep the nation safe.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has signed a measure imposing new restrictions on travelers from a handful of countries. And that includes five that were covered by his travel ban that expired Sunday.\n\nThe indefinite restrictions apply to citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea. As part of the presidential proclamation, the U.S. will also bar the entry of certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate families.\n\nThe changes will take effect October 18. The announcement Sunday came on the same day that Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
