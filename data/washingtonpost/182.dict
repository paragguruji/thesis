(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn less than two months, technology companies went from making nice with Donald Trump at his December tech summit to confronting his travel ban.\n\nIn internal and public statements, the heads of Apple, Alphabet and Facebook have expressed concern for their employees while also criticizing Trump's executive order. Their responses have been characterized as \u201ctepid.\u201d\n\nMany other Silicon Valley firms who did not attend Trump's tech leaders meeting have also spoken up or taken action. Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings wrote in a Facebook post that Trump's actions are \u201churting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe..\u201d\n\nLyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years, while Airbnb says it will provide free housing to those affected by the ban.\n\nAirbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing \u2014 Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 29, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, Uber became the center of a political battleground Saturday even as its CEO said he will be sure to raise the issue on Friday when he and other business advisers are expected to meet with Trump.\n\nHere is what each of the companies who had sent high-level executives to the Trump tech summit has said, either internally to their employees, in statements to the press, or on social media.\n\nAlphabet\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai late on Friday ordered scores of staffers traveling overseas to return to the United States immediately. Pichai sent out a companywide memo that was highly critical of Trump's action, saying it could prevent at least 187 foreign-born Google employees from entering the United States.\n\n\u201cIt's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Pichai wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAmazon.com\n\nThe company sent an internal email to provide guidance on travel.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity \u2014 and we always will be. As we\u2019ve grown the company, we\u2019ve worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes Amazon great \u2014 a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is to make sure you all have the information you need to make travel decisions in the coming days and weeks.\u201d\n\n(Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nApple\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook, who was in Washington to meet with Republican officials, tweeted a historic quote from President Abraham Lincoln highlighting \u201cmalice toward none\u201d and \u201ccharity for all\u201d during a visit to Ford's Theatre.\n\nDeeply moved today visiting @FordsTheatreNPS and Peterson House where Abraham Lincoln took his last breath. His words are timeless. pic.twitter.com/z6mMAvOdzK \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) January 28, 2017\n\nCook later said in a companywide email that without immigration, Apple would not exist; the co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\n\u201cI've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries,\u201d Cook wrote. \u201cI share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.\u201d\n\nHere is the full email:\n\n\u201cIn my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration \u2014 both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\n\nI've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.\n\nThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We\u2019re providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company.\n\nAs I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there\u2019s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it\u2019s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It\u2019s as important now as it\u2019s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued.\n\nApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, 'We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.'\u201d\n\nCisco\n\nThe company has not made a statement on the travel ban.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Friday wrote in a public message that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are indebted to the United States' policy of welcomeness and inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cHad we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\u201d\n\nIBM\n\nIn an email to employees, IBM said it has contacted employees directly affected by the executive order and expressed general support for immigration.\n\n\u201cAs [CEO] Ginni [Rometty] has often reminded us, IBM has long believed in and sought to enable the balance between the responsible flow of people, ideas, commerce and information with the needs of security, everywhere in the world. As IBMers, we have learned, through era after era, that the path forward \u2014 for innovation, for prosperity, and for civil society \u2014 is the path of engagement and openness to the world. Our company will continue to work and advocate for this.\u201d\n\nIntel\n\nThe company has not made a statement on the travel ban.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft general counsel Brad Smith, in a letter to staff Saturday, said that at least 76 employees will be affected by Trump's policy. The company said it has already contacted them with offers of legal assistance and has urged other employees who may be subject to the ban to contact the company as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I\u2019ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\u201d wrote Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, in a LinkedIn post. \u201cWe will continue to advocate on this important topic.\u201d\n\nOracle\n\nThe company has not made a statement on the travel ban.\n\nPalantir\n\nThe company has not made a statement on the travel ban.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said the policy failed to adequately address Trump's priorities.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/brian.d.fung", "type": "article"}
