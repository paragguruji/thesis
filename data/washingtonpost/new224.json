Syrians have been immigrating to Allentown for more than a century. (Mark Makela for The Washington)\n\n\u2014 Hookah smoke drifted through the restaurant as Elias Shetayh and Aziz Wehbey spoke intently about their support for President Trump, whose temporary halt on immigration from war-torn Syria \u2014 their homeland \u2014 had touched off a political firestorm. Nearby, a waitress carried out several platters of Mediterranean food to a large Arab American family.\n\n\u201cTrump is right, in a way, to do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Shetayh said, discussing the executive order banning certain immigrants from entry into the United States. \u201cThis country is going into a disaster.\u201d\n\nAllentown and surrounding Lehigh County have one of the country\u2019s largest and most established communities of Syrian Americans, many of them emigres who moved from the \u201cChristian Valley\u201d in Syria decades ago. They have helped a steady stream of family members join them in the United States, and \u2014 to the surprise of many \u2014 offered strong support to Trump during the presidential election.\n\nGathered at Saado\u2019s on Sunday, Wehbey, Shetayh and Shetayh\u2019s wife, Georgette, took turns talking proudly about Syria and expressed pain at seeing the country split in two. Elias Shetayh\u2019s view is a common refrain up and down the 6th Ward, where many agree with Trump\u2019s decision to end the Syrian refu\u00adgee program, even as they dispute the wisdom of his blanket ban on all legal immigration from Syria as too extreme.\n\n\u201cWe would not like to bring refugees for a simple reason: We do not know their background,\u201d Wehbey said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about, if God forbid a terrorist attack happened here . . . that we\u2019re all labeled as bad people. I hate to say it.\u201d\n\nThe national conversation about the U.S. position on accepting refugees of the Syrian civil war has hit a fever pitch in the days since Trump signed an order halting the program, amid fears that along with refugees, terrorists will seek to surreptitiously enter the country. In Allentown, there is an additional religious subtext: The established Syrians in the 6th Ward are Christian; the newcomers, refugees fleeing the war, tend to be Muslim.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not by any means prejudiced against Islam. As long as you\u2019re a good human being, you have the right to believe whatever you want to believe. But the majority of the population over here are Christian Syrian,\u201d said Wehbey, who is regarded as a community leader. \u201cNow they\u2019re bringing new elements from Syria, refugees shook by a religious war. They may have hate in their heart because of whatever happened to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to see a religious conflict over here,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAziz Wehbey, president of the Syrian American Amarian Charity Society of Pennsylvania, in Allentown on Jan. 29. He came to the United States in 1991. (Mark Makela for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Shetayhs, who own the restaurant, have lived in the United States for decades \u2014 Elias for 46 years, Georgette for 30. Wehbey came to the United States in 1991, when he was 19 years old. All three are now U.S. citizens. They all describe a peaceful and multicultural community here, about 60 miles northwest of Philadelphia, that has embraced diversity without conflict.\n\nAs in most of the rest of the country, there is not consensus in Allentown that the United States should stop accepting refugees, even among those who continue to support Trump.\n\nTalking over baklava and cookies filled with dates, Fouad and Mouna Younes expressed concern about the families who will now be turned away. But even though they disagree with the decision to stop accepting refugees altogether, they insist that Trump is right that refugees must be rigorously screened.\n\n\u201cThese poor people are coming from war. For them to get here and all of a sudden to be told \u2014 and they\u2019re legal and have visas \u2014 and all of a sudden you tell them, \u2018You can\u2019t come in. You have to go back\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Fouad Younes said. \u201cBut instead of fighting amongst ourselves, let\u2019s give the man a chance. Maybe he\u2019s going to bring jobs back.\u201d\n\nLike other pro-Trump Syrian Americans in Allentown, Younes was frustrated by President Barack Obama\u2019s calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Younes supported Obama and said he is \u201cusually a liberal\u201d but supported Trump during the election because of his stances on foreign policy. As a military veteran, Younes said, the controversy over the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, soured him to Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\n\nA 6th Ward street in Allentown, Pa. (Mark Makela for The Washington Post)\n\nLargely supportive of Assad\u2019s regime, many of Allentown\u2019s Syrian Christians have expressed skepticism that any moderate \u201crebels\u201d in Syria exist, including the Free Syrian Army, with many emphasizing that they believe the rebels are hoping to covertly wage a religious war. There remains a strong sense among many of the Syrians in Allentown that Assad led the country reasonably and that things were going in the right direction before the civil war.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as moderate rebels anymore. It\u2019s all jihadis fighting the government. That\u2019s the fear. You saw what happened in Paris and in other European countries,\u201d Younes said, referring to terrorist attacks there. \u201cBut we\u2019re worried about these poor people that are running away from war. These aren\u2019t people that are going to hurt you.\u201d\n\nThe Younes family\u2019s story is typical for immigrants in Allentown; they arranged U.S. residency through family connections and marriage and in turn helped other family members enter the United States as permanent residents, including Mouna Younes\u2019s mother. Her brother, Afif Salibi, immigrated to the United States in 2013 with his wife and four children. Mouna\u2019s younger brother, who lives in Syria, has been unable to arrange a visa. The family was hoping he would be able to apply for refugee status, but the new ban has stalled their hope.\n\nEven if the refugee program permanently ends, Fouad said he won\u2019t necessarily abandon his support for Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to necessarily turn me against him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just turns me against the policy. I\u2019ve always been against the policy.\u201d\n\nMouna added: \u201cI\u2019m with them. You have to decide if these people who are coming are good, are terrorist. They have to get their background.\u201d\n\n\n\nMouna Younes with her children at home in Whitehall, Pa., a town outside of Allentown, on Jan. 29. (Mark Makela for The Washington Post)\n\nMany in the community believe that the U.S. government will make exceptions for Christian Syrians, particularly those with family members already in the United States. Wehbey has advised many in the community to be patient, noting that the travel-ban order is temporary.\n\n\u201cWe are being punished for something we didn\u2019t do. And we\u2019re being labeled as terrorists,\u201d Elias Shetayh said. \u201cI want the president to be tough on everyone, not single out a single people. For Trump to come out and label us as terrorists, it\u2019s not fair to the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nA Syrian refugee who moved to the United States with his wife and six children 16 months ago and now lives in Allentown expressed gratitude to the United States and to the residents of his new home. Speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear that the Trump administration might retaliate against him for talking to the media, he said he believes Americans do not fully understand the depth of the violence wrought by war.\n\nWhen he still lived in Daraa, Syria, he was abducted by authorities one night from his bedroom and held for 37 days, he said. He described repeated beatings while he was detained. In his experience, Syrian Muslims and Christians have always gotten along well, but that all changed after the war started, and he blamed the Syrian government for stoking those tensions. But he said the tensions stay in Syria.\n\n\u201cRadical Muslims don\u2019t come to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people that are coming here are people looking for a better life.\u201d\n\nMouna and Fouad Younes also said that the Christian and Muslim divide was not an issue in Syria before the war. Mouna said that it wasn\u2019t until after the war that she began to sense religious tensions.\n\nFouad added that he agrees with people who say suspicion of all Muslim refugees is wrong: \u201cIt is Islamophobic.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDenied Entry: Stories of refugees and immigrants barred from the U.S.\n\nFrom order to disorder: How Trump\u2019s immigration directive exposed GOP rifts\n\nAngry Republicans lash out at Trump for not consulting them on travel ban", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["syrian", "travel", "right", "trump", "ban", "allentown", "syrians", "refugees", "united", "syria", "pa", "war", "states", "wehbey", "younes", "christian", "way"], "summary": "\u201cTrump is right, in a way, to do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Shetayh said, discussing the executive order banning certain immigrants from entry into the United States.\n(Mark Makela for The Washington Post)The Shetayhs, who own the restaurant, have lived in the United States for decades \u2014 Elias for 46 years, Georgette for 30.\nHer brother, Afif Salibi, immigrated to the United States in 2013 with his wife and four children.\n(Mark Makela for The Washington Post)Many in the community believe that the U.S. government will make exceptions for Christian Syrians, particularly those with family members already in the United States.\n\u201cRadical Muslims don\u2019t come to the United States,\u201d he said."}
