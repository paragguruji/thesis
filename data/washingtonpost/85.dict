(Elaine Cromie/Detroit Free Press via AP)\n\nA 70-year-old Iranian woman with a green card was detained overnight at the Dallas airport. A Syrian woman who landed in Chicago to visit her cancer-stricken mother was forced to turn around and fly back. An Iraq-born doctor coming home to California was held nine hours before reuniting with her husband.\n\nAfter President Trump signed a sprawling executive order Friday, closing the borders to refugees and other travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, such stories surfaced at airports across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how many people were detained or sent away this weekend, though estimates peak at about 375. According to a senior Department of Homeland Security official, about 109 travelers were denied entry to the U.S. and 173 were not allowed to board planes to the country.\n\nAfter protests erupted around the country over the weekend in opposition to Trump's order, the president clarified his intent in an early Monday tweet: He wanted to block what he referred to as bad \u201cdudes.\u201d\n\nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nIn the U.S., \u201cdudes\u201d colloquially refers to men. The Trump administration would not respond to requests for additional information, but the president has previously specified men when speaking about \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the migration, it\u2019s young, strong men,\u201d Trump told Yahoo News last year. \u201cWe cannot take a chance that the people coming over here are going to be ISIS-affiliated.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true men carry out the majority of mass murders and terrorist attacks, Trump\u2019s measure could largely affect women and children.\n\nOf the roughly 4.9 million registered Syrian refugees, for example \u2014 people who are indefinitely banned from entering the U.S., under Trump\u2019s order \u2014 just 25.6 percent [that's about proportional to their numbers in the general population] are men between the ages of 18 and 59, according to United Nations data. (A federal judge blocked part of the order Saturday night, asserting refugees held at airports in the U.S. cannot be pushed back to their home countries.)\n\nAmong all immigrants to the U.S., 37.5 percent were men between the ages of 15 and 59 in 2015, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Women and girls make up the majority \u2014 about 51 percent.\n\nThe order places a 120-day ban on refugees from countries other than Syria from resettling in the U.S. Citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen, meanwhile, are also prohibited from entering the country, regardless of visa status, for 90 days.\n\nA July report on the experiences of 90 Libyan refugees from Amnesty International, a human rights group, found that girls and women in conflict zones faced a heightened risk of sexual violence. \u201cMany said rape was so commonplace that they took contraceptive pills before traveling to avoid becoming pregnant as a result of it,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nSince the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, 12 Islamic militant attackers have committed murder on American soil, said David Sterman, a security policy analyst at New American, a left-leaning Washington think tank. The gender breakdown: 11 men and one woman (Tashfeen Malik, who carried out the 2015 San Bernadino, Calif., mass shooting with her husband.)\n\n\u201cNone emigrated or came from families that emigrated from countries covered by the ban,\u201d Sterman added.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "type": "article"}
