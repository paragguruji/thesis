(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe tranquil home of James Isaacs, an Episcopal priest, and wife Maggie Brewinski Isaacs, a pediatrician, sits on a hill above a creek on 5\u00bd wooded acres in suburban Maryland. Inside, an unoccupied bedroom awaits a refu\u00adgee ready to join the family.\n\nBut the 16-year-old girl, blocked by the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, is stuck in an Ethio\u00adpian refu\u00adgee camp and might never see the room.\n\n\u201cThe children ask us when their big sister is going to arrive,\u201d James Isaacs said of his sons, ages 4 and 2, one of whom was adopted from South Africa. \u201cWe are left in this time of uncertainty because of the administration and the Supreme Court decision.\u201d\n\nThe girl, from the East African nation of Eritrea and identified to The Washington Post only by her initials \u201cM.T.\u201d to protect her privacy, is an \u201cunaccompanied minor refu\u00adgee\u201d \u2014 a young, displaced person without a parent or guardian who is seeking refuge in the United States.\n\n\n\nJimmy Isaacs, 4, left, and his brother, Joseph, 2, play on the bed inside the room that the family prepared to foster an \u201cunaccompanied minor refugee\u201d from Africa. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nA painting is seen inside the room that Irene Stevenson prepared to foster an \u201cunaccompanied minor refugee\u201d from Africa. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nOn July 19, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban to stand, leaving about 100 unaccompanied minor refugees stranded overseas. The decision comes after months of judicial back-and-forth over the ban, casting doubt on the children\u2019s plans to live in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey are youth that are on their own,\u201d said Autumn Orme, a director at Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, which works with unaccompanied minor refugees. \u201cI find it pretty extraordinary that they are managing this all on their own. These are children that don\u2019t have parents to care for them.\u201d\n\n[Supreme Court allows Trump refugee ban but backs broader exemptions for relatives]\n\nThe result: M.T., an orphan who fled child labor in Eritrea two years ago and was approved by the State Department to live in the United States, remains in legal limbo.\n\n\u201cNot only is she missing out now, we\u2019re missing out,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nThe Isaacs family is not the only one with an empty bedroom after the ban.\n\nIrene Stevenson, 55, worked as a labor organizer in Russia and Central Asia before she was expelled by authorities, she said. She moved to Washington in 2007 and lives in a small townhouse near RFK Stadium with Kale and Lida, two Russian wolfhounds, and Nikulin, a longhair cat.\n\n\n\nIrene Stevenson, 55, of Washington, plays with her cat, Nikulin. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nShe considered adopting a child for years but was stymied by the paperwork. Then, about 18 months ago, reports about the refu\u00adgee crisis caused her to \u201chit the wall,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about literally the millions of children who have no family, have no home, who are completely alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is stupid. I have a home. I can do this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nStevenson signed on last year with Lutheran Social Services to become a certified foster parent for an unaccompanied minor refu\u00adgee. She was approved after about six months of training and cleared out a bedroom for \u201cA.A.,\u201d a 17-year-old Somali girl who fled to Kenya with her grandmother in 2004 after war broke out.\n\nNow, A.A.\u2019s grandmother and father are dead, and her mother can\u2019t be found. Though she was approved to live with Stevenson, she remains in Kenya, where aid workers fear she will be targeted because she is an ethnic minority.\n\nStevenson \u2014 who, like A.A., is Muslim \u2014 said she can offer the girl stability. The Trump travel ban, she said, makes that impossible.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a 17-year-old girl refugee in Kenya without any living relatives, you don\u2019t have any avenues to try to build something,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cBuilding roadblocks seems crazy. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nKay Bellor, a vice president at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service in Baltimore, said her agency is one of only two nonprofit organizations in the country that work with the State Department to bring these children into the country. Thirty-nine children it planned to bring to U.S. foster homes now cannot come.\n\nAbout 200 unaccompanied refu\u00adgee minors arrived in the United States last year, said Ashley Feasley, policy director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the other nonprofit that works with these refugees. Most come from the Congo, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Burma, and are between 15 and 17 years old when referred to the program.\n\n(Claritza Jimenez,Dani Player/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban and subsequent court decisions, however, mean more than 60 children the organization was working with are stranded, Feasley said. The initial travel ban, which went into effect with little warning in January, was the first roadblock. After courts removed that, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on a modified version of the ban last month blocked the children again.\n\nThen, recently, a federal judge in Hawaii ordered exemptions to the ban for refugees \u2014 but that ruling was quashed by the Supreme Court.\n\nBishop Joe S. Vasquez, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Migration, said the Supreme Court decision in June had \u201chuman consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the welfare of the many other vulnerable populations who will now not be allowed to arrive and seek protection . . . most notably certain individuals fleeing religious persecution and unaccompanied refugee children,\u201d he said in a statement last month.\n\n[U.S. surpasses Trump administration\u2019s cap on refugee admissions]\n\nCiting the July 19 Supreme Court decision, a State Department spokesman said a refugee\u2019s involvement with a resettlement agency does not qualify as a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d If a refu\u00adgee has another claim to a bona fide relationship, it would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the spokesman said.\n\nThe path to the United States for unaccompanied refu\u00adgee children is already narrow.\n\nThey are identified overseas by the United Nations and must be cleared by doctors and the Department of Homeland Security. Depending on the rules of their home country, they may have to secure travel visas, which can expire if something such as a travel ban even temporarily halts their progress.\n\nAnd if they turn 18 while waiting for paperwork, as A.A. will in less than a year, they cannot be part of the program. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, will not hear arguments on the travel ban until October.\n\n\u201cIf it was something academic \u2014 whether a zoning issue is proper \u2014 it could wait until October,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cThese are people\u2019s lives. Every time they postpone it, it gets worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nIrene Stevenson sits in the room that she prepared to foster an unaccompanied minor refugee from Africa. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nTesfay Rezene ran this gantlet after fleeing his native Eritrea in 2008 at 14, fearing he would be conscripted amid that nation\u2019s tensions with neighboring Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia. He left his family behind, telling his father about his plan at the last minute.\n\n\u201cHe told me that, \u2018Well, if you think that\u2019s better, you can go,\u2019 \u201d Rezene said. \u201cIt was a very emotional moment. My younger sister, she followed me about a mile \u2014 I told her to go back.\u201d\n\nRezene ended up at Shimelba Refugee Camp in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia, where he lived for about three years. He called it \u201cone of the very worst places in the world.\u201d\n\nIt was hot. There wasn\u2019t enough food, and the need to collect water \u2014 available only for a few hours in the morning and afternoon \u2014 made it tough to go to school. He lived in two rooms in a small house with up to six people at a time.\n\nAfter being identified as an unaccompanied minor refu\u00adgee, he moved to Montgomery County in Maryland in 2011. Living with a foster family, he had his own room, his own computer and started learning English \u201cfrom scratch,\u201d he said. He\u2019s since become a citizen and studies international politics at Pennsylvania State University\u2019s campus in Berks, Pa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a refugee that is an enemy to the U.S.,\u201d Rezene said. \u201cA refugee is a victim that is looking for someone who can save them. They are looking for someone who can listen to them or share their pain or understand what they are going through.\u201d\n\nCarissa Ralbovsky, 30, and Joe Ralbovsky, 27, are ready to take on the challenge. Before they have children of their own, the Greenbelt, Md., couple wanted to \u201chelp someone in need right now,\u201d Carissa Ralbovsky said.\n\nThey are Christian \u2014 but faith is not the only reason they want to help.\n\n\u201cWe think of it not just as a religious thing,\u201d Joe Ralbovsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s an American thing.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the couple became certified as foster parents and were ready to welcome \u201cB.S.,\u201d a 17-year-old boy from Eritrea. Teenagers, especially males, are hard to place in foster care, Carissa Ralbovsky said, and they wanted \u201cto take in someone no one else wanted.\u201d\n\nThey prepared a room for the boy. They planned to pick him up at the airport on June 26, the day the Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to go into effect.\n\nThey are still waiting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most afraid that we have already let him down before he even got here,\u201d she said.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-07-28", "type": "article"}
