(Jim Watson/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFormer secretary of defense Robert M. Gates said Sunday that President Trump\u2019s order to halt travel from seven Muslim-majority countries could make international affairs more difficult for Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state.\n\nGates, who served as defense secretary under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under president George H.W. Bush, said he expects a number of countries will have a \u201cnegative reaction\u201d to Trump\u2019s order. He said the order, paired with Obama\u2019s drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, could signal that the United States is backing away from global commitments.\n\n\u201cI would say that the actions and the rhetoric of the new president simply continue that drumbeat of giving the impression around the world that the United States is pulling back,\u201d Gates said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThis creates, whether we want it or not, a vacuum, and that vacuum will not be filled by benign forces. \u201d\n\nGates said he thinks that any effort to strengthen national security by improving vetting of people seeking to enter the country is reasonable and legitimate, but that it has to be done in a way \u201cthat doesn\u2019t risk creating more enemies than threats it deters.\u201d He said military officials are worried about the order.\n\n\u201cI know that former senior commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan are very concerned about this order and what it \u2014 the impact it will have on those that helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan, the interpreters, translators and so on, who were promised safe haven in the United States and now may not get it,\u201d Gates said.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "type": "article"}
