Kerry speaks with the media in Paris. (Pool photo by Alex Brandon via AP)\n\nFormer secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, along with Leon Panetta and other former top national security officials, entered the fray over President Trump\u2019s travel ban early Monday with an unusual declaration stating that it \u201cundermines\u201d national security and will \u201cendanger U.S. troops in the field.\u201d\n\nThe six-page joint declaration was addressed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in support of the temporary order blocking implementation of Trump\u2019s ban on entry for travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The executive order was blocked by a U.S. district court judge, prompting the government to appeal in what is becoming an unprecedented battle over executive power.\n\nThe declaration came as the state of Washington, which initially sought the restraining order, formally responded to the administration\u2019s appeal. The government\u2019s brief is due later Monday.\n\n[9th Circuit Court declines to quickly reinstate travel ban]\n\nWhile the declaration by the officials is not part of the formal briefing in the case and judges have no obligation to read it, it is clearly meant to counter the government\u2019s argument that continuing to block Trump\u2019s executive action will cause great harm to the nation\u2019s security. It perhaps also has the public relations function of responding to Trump\u2019s Twitter claim that Judge James L. Robart was putting the \u201ccountry in such peril\u201d and that he and the court system should be blamed \u201cif something happens.\u201d\n\nThe basic theme of the declaration was that it is Trump\u2019s order, not any judge\u2019s ruling, that is putting the country in peril.\n\nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nNumerous \u201cfriend of the court\u201d briefs have been filed in the case as well, the latest by 97 major tech companies.\n\nThe former officials implicitly took strong issue with the Trump administration\u2019s claim that a similar approach had been taken by President Barack Obama during his administration.\n\nOthers signing the declaration in addition to Kerry, Albright and former secretary of defense and CIA director Panetta were John E. McLaughlin, deputy director of the CIA from 2000 to 2004 and acting director in 2004; Lisa O. Monaco, former assistant to Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism; Michael Morell, a career CIA official who has served as deputy director and acting director; former homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano; and Susan E. Rice, Obama\u2019s ambassador to the U.N. and national security adviser.\n\n\n\nFormer secretary of defense Leon Panetta delivers a speech on the third day of the Democratic National Convention on July 27, 2016.

Rather, they said, they viewed it as one that \u201cultimately undermines the national security of the United States rather than making us safer.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, they said, the order will \u201cendanger U.S. troops in the field\u201d who \u201cfight alongside allies in some of the named countries who put their lives on the line to protect Americans.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence on Feb. 5 defended President Trump's travel ban while senators questioned Trump's criticism of the federal judge who temporarily blocked the ban. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nIt will \u201cdisrupt key counterterrorism, foreign policy and national security partnerships that are critical to our obtaining\u201d intelligence necessary to combat terrorist groups like the Islamic State, they declared, and \u201cendanger intelligence sources in the field\u201d by \u201cbreaching faith\u201d with them.\n\nThey described Trump\u2019s order as one of \u201cunprecedented scope,\u201d adding: \u201cWe know of no case where a President has invoked his statutory authority to suspend admission for such a broad class of people.\u2026 In past cases suspensions were limited to particular individuals or subclasses of nationals who posed a specific articulable threat based on their known actions and affiliations.\n\n\u201cThere is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens from the seven named countries,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSince September 11, 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order. Very few attacks on U.S. soil\u201d since 9/11 \u201chave been traced to foreign nationals at all. The overwhelming majority of attacks have been committed by U.S. citizens.\u2026 In our professional opinion, the Order will harm the interests of the United States in many respects.\u201d\n\nThe full declaration can be read here.\n\nThe state of Washington\u2019s latest brief is available here.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
