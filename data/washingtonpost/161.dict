(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday filed its notice of appeal to the freeze on President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban imposed by a federal judge in Hawaii.\n\nThe move means that the case will once again head to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which upheld the court-imposed suspension of Trump\u2019s first travel ban before the president revoked and rewrote the executive order. The president has been particularly critical of the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit, which has a reputation for being liberal.\n\n[Trump said dangerous people might be pouring in without his travel ban. But he\u2019s not rushing to restore it.]\n\nWhat that means is we'll soon have two concurrent appeals of travel ban rulings, in both 4th and 9th circuits pic.twitter.com/c9sEBwDYtD \u2014 Matt Zapotosky (@mattzap) March 30, 2017\n\nThe Justice Department is also pursuing an appeal of a separate freeze on Trump\u2019s revised travel ban in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond. That case, which stems from a federal district court in Maryland, is farther along, and the judges will likely decide next week whether to put the ruling by a lower court judge against the travel ban on hold.\n\nThe appeal notice in the 9th Circuit comes a day after U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson maintained his freeze on Trump\u2019s travel ban by taking the technical step of converting his temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. That injunction offers a more permanent block of Trump\u2019s ban, although it also allows the Justice Department to ask a higher court to intervene.\n\nAn ultimate decision on the ban likely remains weeks away, and to get the ban restored fully, the Justice Department must either win in both appeals courts or persuade the Supreme Court to intervene. It is unclear exactly how soon that could happen. A hearing in the 4th Circuit is scheduled for May 8. Proceedings in the 9th Circuit have not been scheduled, and the Justice Department has yet to lay out its arguments there.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-30", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
