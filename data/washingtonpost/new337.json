Robart, the president blasted out his unhappiness with an extraordinarily personal criticism.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump said in a Saturday morning tweet.

Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement.\n\nThe State Department said that those with valid visas could enter the country. DHS said it would \u201cresume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure\u201d that existed before Trump\u2019s more restrictive executive order.\n\nAdvocates encouraged travelers from the affected countries who qualified for entry to get on planes as soon as possible because of the unpredictable legal terrain.\n\nThe developments continued what has been a chaotic rollout of Trump\u2019s order, made on Jan. 27. More than a dozen legal challenges have been filed around the country, and only one judge so far has indicated that he was willing to let Trump\u2019s order stand.\n\nThe decision of Robart, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and has been on the bench since 2004, was the most consequential because of its national implications.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for a district judge to issue an order that affects the entire country, but Robart said it was necessary to follow Congress\u2019s intention that \u201cthe immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.\u201d\n\nHe was quoting from a 2015 appeals court ruling that had blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action that would have made it easier for undocumented immigrants in this country to remain. It was never implemented because of legal challenges.\n\n(Natalie Jennings,Bastien Inzaurralde,Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\n[Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says]\n\nJustice Department lawyers were preparing to immediately ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to dissolve Robart\u2019s order, but had not filed anything as of Saturday evening. It will go to a panel of judges who consider such emergency requests, and that decision could be crucial.\n\nWhile the losing side can then request intervention from the Supreme Court, it would take the votes of five justices to overturn the panel decision. The court has been shorthanded since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago, and ideologically divided between four liberal and four conservative members.\n\nThe issue could reach the high court in days \u2014 or weeks.\n\nRobart granted a request from attorneys for the states of Washington and Minnesota who had asked him to stop the government from acting on critical sections of Trump\u2019s order. Justice and State department officials had revealed earlier Friday that about 60,000 \u2014 and possibly as many as 100,000 \u2014 visas already have been provisionally revoked as a result of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that because of the court case, officials would examine the revoking of those visas so that people would be allowed to travel.\n\nRobart\u2019s order also enjoined the government from enforcing a section of the executive order that bars the entry of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe State Department said it is still working with other government agencies and the organizations that process refugees overseas to comply with the judge\u2019s order. That means the action may not immediately help those seeking approval. Immigration lawyers said the State Department had informed them they should rebook trips for refugees whose plans were canceled after the executive order, which temporarily halted the refu\u00adgee resettlement program.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would allow 872 refugees into the country who were \u201calready in transit\u201d and would face \u201cundue hardship\u201d if denied admission.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is another stinging rejection of President Trump\u2019s unconstitutional Muslim ban,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cWe will keep fighting to permanently dismantle this un-American executive order.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of Robart reminded some of his remarks during the presidential campaign about the impartiality of a California federal judge who was hearing a class-action lawsuit involving Trump University.\n\nOthers counted that Obama had also been critical of judicial decisions he did not like \u2014 scolding the Supreme Court during a State of the Union address for its decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and saying during the legal battle over the Affordable Care Act that it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d to strike it down.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s denunciation of Robart was more personal and direct. Vice President Pence defended the president\u2019s words in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that will air on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe agreed with Stephanopoulos that Robart had the authority for his ruling, and said \u201cwe\u2019ll go through the process in the courts to get a stay of that order, so that, again, we can implement this action that is entirely focused on the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\n\nOther Republican leaders were mute, on both the decision and Trump\u2019s language, and some in the GOP were unsettled by it.\n\n\u201cMy advice to POTUS \u2014 attack the decision (it\u2019s weak) not the judge,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal R. Labrador (R-Idaho), who had backed Trump\u2019s immigration order, wrote on Twitter. \u201cLiberals are imploding, don\u2019t make personal attacks the story.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were not shy. \u201cThe president\u2019s attack . . . shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn\u2019t always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\nLeahy said Trump \u201cseems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nThe legal battles over Trump\u2019s immigration order have become the mirror image of Obama\u2019s attempt to shield illegal immigrants after Congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nObama\u2019s executive action would have deferred deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants who had been in the country since 2010, had not committed any serious crimes and had family ties to U.S. citizens or others lawfully in the country.\n\nIn that case, Republican state attorneys general led the fight against the order. A district judge in Texas agreed with them that it probably exceeded the president\u2019s powers, and issued a nationwide injunction. Months later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit agreed; months after that, the Supreme Court took up the issue.\n\nBut the court deadlocked, meaning that the lower court ruling stood and the Obama administration suffered one of its most consequential legal defeats.\n\nThe players have changed sides now, with Democratic attorneys general and immigrant rights groups leading the fight against Trump and celebrating a district judge\u2019s imposition of a nationwide order.\n\nAnne Gearan, Abigail Hauslohner, Katie Zezima, Spencer S.
