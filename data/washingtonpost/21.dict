(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Thursday that there is no reason for the court to rule on the legality of the president\u2019s previous ban on travel from certain countries and that lower-court rulings against the president\u2019s position should be erased.\n\nOpponents of the ban, who had persuaded two appeals courts to block the executive order, said the court should continue to review the cases. Even if not, they said, the lower-court rulings should stand.\n\nThe justices asked for the new briefing about whether the issue was moot since President Trump announced a replacement travel ban last month. The court canceled an oral argument on the issue scheduled for next week.\n\n[White House announces expanded travel ban]\n\nThe cases raise complicated and far-reaching issues about the president\u2019s powers, and many legal experts believe the court may not want to jump in unless it is necessary. It is unclear when the court will rule on whether to proceed.\n\nSolicitor General Noel J. Francisco said the new proclamation means that temporary measures under review at the Supreme Court have been superseded.\n\n\u201cIf this court were to continue to hear these appeals, it would be asked to decide questions with no ongoing practical import,\u201d Francisco wrote.\n\nHe also said two rulings that went against Trump \u2014 by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2014 should be vacated.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to stand, the lower courts\u2019 decisions threaten to undermine the executive\u2019s ability to deal with sensitive foreign-policy issues in strategically important regions of the world,\u201d Francisco wrote.\n\nThe previous order was challenged by the state of Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union as an illegal ban on Muslims. Hawaii and the ACLU were representing those with family members affected by the ban.\n\n[ACLU to challenge Trump\u2019s latest travel ban]\n\n\u201cThe 90-day ban on their relatives has now been converted into an indefinite ban with the potential to separate their families, and thousands of others\u2019, for years,\u201d wrote ACLU lawyer Omar C. Jadwat, asking the court to keep the cases alive.\n\n\u201cAnd the religious condemnation of the earlier Executive Order is not dissipated by [the new one], which \u2014 despite some new window dressing \u2014 continues to relay a message of disparagement to the plaintiffs and other members of their faith.\u201d\n\nBut both the ACLU\u2019s submission and the one from Hawaii seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the court would pass on reviewing the old executive orders.\n\n\u201cThe court will soon have another opportunity to determine the legality of the President\u2019s actions in the context of the new order\u201d because legal challenges to it are underway, wrote Washington attorney Neal K. Katyal, representing Hawaii.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland said this week that those suing over the previous travel ban could amend their complaint and file a request for a preliminary injunction to block the new one. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Oct. 17.\n\nBut both challengers said it would be unfair to wipe out lower court decisions because of the government\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cAny mootness would be entirely the consequence of the government\u2019s voluntary actions \u2014 in managing the timing of the bans, in declining to seek a swift hearing on the merits, and in rebottling its old ban in a new order,\u201d Katyal wrote.\n\n\u201cIt would be profoundly inequitable to permit the government to use these maneuvers to obtain the very relief it sought on the merits: vacatur of the injunctions,\u201d he wrote.\n\n[The puzzling inclusion of Chad in Trump\u2019s new travel ban]\n\nThe latest travel ban could block the issuance of tens of thousands of visas each year to people who want to immigrate to the United States or to come on business or as tourists, according to a Washington Post review of State Department data.\n\nIn some ways it is more expansive than the second executive order it replaced \u2014 remaining in effect indefinitely and imposing restrictions on eight, rather than six, countries. But unlike the previous ban, the restrictions vary from place to place, and countries that increase their cooperation and information-sharing with the United States might be able to find their way off the list.\n\nThe proclamation was issued after a lengthy process in which U.S. officials reviewed vetting procedures and sought information from countries around the world. Those that were either unwilling or unable to produce the data the United States wanted ended up on the banned list.\n\nFor Syria and North Korea, the president\u2019s proclamation blocks immigrants wanting to relocate to the United States and nonimmigrants wishing to visit in some capacity. For Iran, the proclamation blocks both immigrants and nonimmigrants, although it exempts students and those participating in a cultural exchange.\n\nThe proclamation blocks people from Chad, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States as immigrants or on business or tourist visas, and it blocks people from Somalia from coming as immigrants. It names Venezuela, but it blocks only certain government officials and their families. Sudan, which was covered by the previous ban, was removed from the list.\n\nMatt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-10-05", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "type": "article"}
