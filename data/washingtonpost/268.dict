The reasons for the rejections remain unclear \u2014 India is not among the seven countries named in Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 but after the intervention of Saranac Lake\u2019s mayor and the office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi reversed its decision.\n\nHussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero\u2019s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodging at an inn that in the snow looked like a \u201cfairy tale scene from a movie,\u201d Khan said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe \u201cfairy tale\u201d was shattered Wednesday when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.\n\nThe parents of the 12-year-old girl who was allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.\n\nHussain competes in the world championships for snowshoeing in Saranac Lake, N.Y., on Feb. 25.

Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment when the two were alone, and that\u2019s when the incident occurred,\u201d Potthast said. The girl told police that there was a \u201cpassionate kiss\u201d and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.\n\nHussain remains jailed on $10,000 bond. Khan said the athlete told him that he did nothing wrong.\n\nMuddasir Mir, president of the SnowShoe Federation of India, said the next court hearing is set for Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation, both for the community there in the U.S. who supported us and the federation,\u201d Mir said. \u201cWe have full faith in the American law, and as there is a court proceeding going on, that is going to be my only comment.\u201d\n\nHussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. He placed in the top 50 at the World Snowshoe Championships last year in Italy, Mir said, but failed to place in the top 100 this year.\n\nHussain\u2019s brother, Yunus Ali, said the family has not been able to speak to Hussain since the arrest.\n\n\u201cIn Kashmir, we have a tradition of showing love to children. We hug and kiss a child here, and our society doesn\u2019t see it as a crime,\u201d he said.\n\nHussain and Khan said they were indirect victims of the U.S. travel ban when their first attempt to procure visas was turned down in late January, the first business day after the ban was put in place. Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said they were being rejected because of \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials said at the time that the denials were not connected to the travel ban. The embassy in New Delhi had no comment.\n\nSaranac Lake Mayor Clyde Rabideau, a key supporter of the men, said in a statement that the community was \u201cunderstandably shocked\u201d by the allegations against Hussain.\n\nMir had said that the visas would not have been issued without the \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d of Schumer and New York\u2019s other Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand. On Feb. 25, Schumer celebrated Hussain\u2019s \u201crock star\u201d welcome in a Facebook post, saying that the United States is \u201cstill a country that welcomes athletes from across the globe to compete in our stadiums, our snow-covered fields and everywhere in between.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Schumer said the senator helped with the visa process at the request of Saranac Lake and described the charges against Hussain as \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator thinks the charges are \u201cextremely serious.\u201d\n\nDuring their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf. \u201cPack your bags. Next year you are coming to Kashmir,\u201d Hussain told them, according to one of Khan\u2019s Facebook posts.\n\nIshfaq Naseem in Kashmir contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly linked the denial of a U.S. visa for Tanveer Hussain to President Trump\u2019s travel ban. India was not one of the seven countries affected by the ban.\n\nRead more\n\nWho is affected?
