(Michel Euler/Associated Press)\n\nCall it the Trump bump.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the sarcastic spin from some Iranians who believe that the uproar over President Trump\u2019s travel ban helped give some extra Oscar buzz to \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d which took home the Academy Award in the best foreign language category Sunday.\n\nIran doesn\u2019t really need a boost with the academy. Iranian films have pulled in prizes worldwide for decades, including an Oscar in 2012 for Asghar Farhadi\u2019s \u201cA Separation.\u201d\n\nBut this year, it was hard to separate the nomination for Farhadi\u2019s \u201cThe Salesman\u201d and Trump\u2019s clampdown on travel to the United States by refugees as well as citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations, including Iran. Farhadi stayed away from the Academy Awards ceremony in protest. So did the cast.\n\n[The Oscars\u2019 most political moments]\n\nThe snubs, some contend, might have resonated well with the Oscar-awarding judges opposed to Trump\u2019s executive order, which is locked in a court challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not with you tonight,\u201d said a statement from Farhadi read by Iranian American astronaut Anousheh Ansari, who has taken part in a mission on the International Space Station.\n\n\u201cMy absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nBefore the ceremony, Farhadi joined the four other directors of films nominated in the foreign language category in issuing a statement decrying a rising tide of \u201cfanaticism\u201d in the United States. The directors \u2014 whose films' casts and crews span the globe \u2014 agreed that this year\u2019s award would be dedicated to \u201cunity and understanding\u201d regardless of who won.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted congratulations to the cast and crew of \u201cThe Salesman\u201d and their \u201cstance against #MuslimBan.\u201d\n\nProud of cast & crew of \"The Salesman\" for Oscar & stance against #MuslimBan. Iranians have represented culture & civilization for millennia \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) February 27, 2017\n\nThe film itself has nothing to do with international politics. The story is about a Tehran couple performing Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d and their struggles with social stigmas after the wife is assaulted in their apartment.\n\nYet many Iranian movie fans and others rallied around the belief that the Oscar win was something of a Hollywood referendum on the White House.\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of you,\u201d said one Twitter message using the hashtags #travelban and #trump.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KhoshAzar/status/836124739735326720\n\nBanifilm, a leading Iranian film industry newspaper and website, posted an opinion piece saying Trump \u201cprobably never imagined what contribution the travel ban would have for Farhadi\u2019s film.\u201d\n\nAcross Iranian social media, a popular cartoon depicted Farhadi playing chess and using an Oscar to take out his opponent\u2019s piece.
