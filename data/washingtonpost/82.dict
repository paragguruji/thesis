(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s revised travel ban faces two major legal tests this month when federal appeals courts on opposite coasts take up challenges to an executive order that the administration says is urgently needed for national security and that opponents say discriminates against Muslims.\n\nThe first hearing comes Monday in Richmond.\n\nFederal immigration law gives the president broad authority to bar foreign travelers from entering the United States. The Trump administration\u2019s new policy temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and blocks new visas to citizens of six majority Muslim countries.\n\nBefore the order could take effect in March, a judge in Maryland and one in Hawaii halted enforcement of critical sections, pointing to comments by Trump and top advisers indicating that they wanted to bar Muslims from entry.\n\nOn Monday, a panel of more than a dozen judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit will consider whether to leave in place the Maryland decision siding with challengers who say the order violates First Amendment prohibitions on government denigration of a particular religion.\n\nActing Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall is set to defend President Trump\u2019s entry ban at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit on May 8. (Department of Justice)\n\nJudges are likely to have questions about the administration\u2019s national security justification for targeting the six countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 and about the relevance of Trump\u2019s statements before and after he took the oath of office.\n\n[Judges take Trump at his word \u2014 and that\u2019s not been good for the president]\n\nIn his March ruling, Maryland U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang wrote that the \u201chistory of public statements continues to provide a con\u00advincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nJustice Department lawyers want the Richmond-based appeals court to lift Chuang\u2019s injunction that applies only to the part of Trump\u2019s order that would temporarily block new visas for 90 days.\n\nHow quickly the 4th Circuit will rule is not known. But in an unusual step, the court bypassed the traditional three-judge panel and will review the case as a full complement of as many as 14 judges. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Ronald Reagan nominee, will not participate Monday because his son-in-law, Jeffrey B. Wall, will argue the government\u2019s case as acting solicitor general.\n\nTo resurrect the administration\u2019s policy in full, the Justice Department would have to win in Richmond and in its upcoming appeal of the Hawaii ruling at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit \u2014 or eventually persuade the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit has scheduled oral arguments for May 15 in Seattle.\n\nOmar Jadwat, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, is set to argue against the Trump travel ban on May 8 in Richmond. (ACLU)\n\n[Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban]\n\nThe revised travel order followed widespread confusion and protest in January after a first executive order led to deportations along with the detentions of people already aboard flights to the United States as the order was signed. The 9th Circuit in February upheld a court order that suspended the original travel ban, leading to the president\u2019s revamped version.\n\nThe new order dropped Iraq from the list of affected countries and did not touch those with permanent residency status and valid visa holders, as the first order had.\n\nIn Richmond, government attorneys will ask the court to limit its review to the language of the order. The ban does not mention religion, and the administration says it is designed to give officials time to assess existing screening procedures for entries from countries that Congress and the Obama administration previously identified as areas of \u201cconcern.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said in court filings that the lower court\u2019s reliance on campaign statements made by then-candidate Trump is \u201cunprecedented\u201d: \u201cThe court should have focused on official acts, not perceived subjective motivations.\u201d\n\nTop law enforcement officials from 13 states, including Texas, Arizona and Florida, backed the administration in court filings, urging the 4th Circuit not to interfere with \u201can area of strongest executive authority\u201d and arguing that foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States.\n\n[Federal appeals court maintains suspension of Trump's immigration order]\n\nThe challenge in Maryland was brought by organizations and individuals, including Muslim U.S. citizens and Muslim permanent residents who are trying to reunite with relatives who would be affected by the ban. They are being represented by the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAllowing the policy to go forward harms the individual plaintiffs by \u201cprolonging their separation from their loved ones, most of whom remain in dangerous conditions abroad,\u201d according to their attorneys, led by ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat.\n\nOpponents argue that the president\u2019s travel order specifically violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which forbids the government from favoring or condemning a particular religion.\n\n\u201cThe anti-Muslim message embodied by the order singles them out for particular condemnation and stigma because they are Muslim immigrants,\u201d the ACLU filing said.\n\nDiverse organizations representing technology companies in Massachusetts, art museum directors, religious leaders and labor unions filed briefs opposing the administration\u2019s policy.\n\nMore than 40 former national security, foreign policy and intelligence officials, including former secretaries of state Madeleine K. Albright and John F. Kerry, also signed on to a brief saying the blanket ban is misguided and would undermine U.S. security by adding to the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam. The order will \u201cimpair relationships with the very Muslim communities that law enforcement professionals rely on to address the threat of terrorism.\u201d\n\nNational security is not at risk, the former officials said, because travelers are already subjected to vigorous vetting before visas are issued.\n\nA coalition of about 50 constitutional law professors joined a separate brief insisting the president\u2019s remarks must be considered. Even if the court defers to the president when it comes to immigration and national security, the professors said, \u201cit is hard to imagine a clearer case of governmental action motived by animus toward a single religion.\u201d\n\nAttorneys opposed to the ban drew parallels to the 1944 Supreme Court case Korematsu v. United States and urged caution. In that case, the court deferred to the executive\u2019s national security concerns to uphold the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nUniversity of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, who signed on to a brief challenging the first iteration of the ban, said Korematsu\u2019s lesson is that \u201ceven \u2014 if not especially \u2014 when the government claims a discriminatory policy is justified by amorphous national security concerns, courts should treat such claims with great skepticism.\u201d\n\nMatt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-07", "type": "article"}
