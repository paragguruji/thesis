(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nTwo federal judges have now blocked President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, and both cited extensively the president\u2019s own words \u2014 and those of his close advisers \u2014 as reasons they were convinced to do so. The comments, the judges said, provide strong evidence that the directive was meant to disfavor Muslims and thus violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that the comments should not be considered, because, in the department\u2019s view, the courts should not look beyond official statements and the order itself to determine its purpose. Informal statements to the media, they say, \u201cmay not accurately reflect the government\u2019s position.\u201d And statements on the campaign trail, they have asserted, are particularly irrelevant.\n\n\u201cThey generally are made without the benefit of advice from an as-yet-unformed Administration, and cannot bind elected officials who later conclude that a different course is warranted,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote in one court filing.\n\nSo what is it that the president and his advisers have said that is now causing so much consternation? Here are seven examples that judges have cited as they have ruled against his new ban.\n\n[What\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0]\n\n1) \u201cA total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nA press release issued during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in December 2015 declared unequivocally, \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d The release \u2014 which was still available as of 1:27 p.m. Thursday on the campaign\u2019s website \u2014 also alleged a \u201cgreat hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,\u201d Trump said in the release. \u201cUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.\u201d\n\nJudge Derrick K. Watson noted the press release in particular in his ruling Thursday that halted Trump\u2019s executive order, declaring there was nothing \u201cveiled\u201d about it.\n\n2) \u201cHe said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 \u2026 Show me the right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close Trump adviser during the campaign, appeared on Fox News Channel after the first travel ban was signed in January and claimed to know \u201cthe whole history of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said.\n\nWatson cited that comment in his ruling, too, declaring it showed there was nothing \u201csecret\u201d about Trump\u2019s motive in issuing it.\n\n3) \u201cThe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d\n\nAfter courts froze Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and he said he intended to issue a new one, policy adviser Stephen Miller spoke to Fox News Channel\u2019s Martha MacCallum about the possible revisions.\n\n\u201cWell, one of the big differences that you\u2019re going to see in the executive order is that it\u2019s going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn\u2019t exist previously. And so these are mostly minor technical differences,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, you\u2019re still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country, but you\u2019re going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court and those will be addressed. But in terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.\u201d\n\nThat comment was particularly important because it connected the previous travel ban \u2014 which courts had frozen \u2014 to the new one, which Justice Department lawyers have argued was substantially different from the first. Watson cited it, too, as he asserted, \u201cThese plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order, and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the Executive Order\u2019s stated secular purpose.\u201d\n\n4) \u201cYou could say it\u2019s an expansion.\u201d\n\nIn July 2016, soon after he formally became the Republican presidential nominee, Trump was pressed in an interview on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on whether he was rolling back his proposed Muslim ban.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rollback. In fact, you could say it\u2019s an expansion. I\u2019m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling blocking a critical portion of Trump\u2019s new ban, U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland cited that comment in particular.\n\n5) \u201cWe all know what that means.\u201d\n\nAs he signed his first travel ban, Trump told those gathered. \u201cAnd this is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cProtection of the nation from foreign terrorists\u2019 entry into the United States. That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d\n\nChuang cited that comment, too, in his ruling. Though vague, it seemed to hint at the controversy over Trump\u2019s campaign-trail promise of a Muslim ban. And the next day, Giuliani\u2019s said on Fox News Channel that Trump used the phrase \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and asked him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn particular, the direct statements by President Trump and Mayor Giuliani\u2019s account of his conversations with President Trump reveal that the plan had been to bar the entry of nationals of predominantly Muslim countries deemed to constitute dangerous territory in order to approximate a Muslim ban without calling it one \u2014 precisely the form of the travel ban in the First Executive Order,\u201d Chuang wrote.\n\n6) Prioritizing Christians\n\nEarlier in the day he signed his first travel ban, Trump was asked by the Christian Broadcasting Network, \u201cAs it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the president responded.\n\nHe continued: \u201cDo you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive order actually contained an exception to the section that barred refugees from entering the country for members of a religious minorities. Opponents pointed to that as evidence in the order itself that the measure was meant to disfavor Muslims, and the interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network seemed to offer more proof.\n\nThe religious minority exception was removed from the revised executive order, but the two judges still highlighted the Christian Broadcasting Network interview in their rulings.\n\n7) \u201cThe principles of the executive order remain the same.\u201d\n\nTrump signed his second travel ban out of public view on March 6, only to have administration officials \u2014 including the attorney general, homeland security secretary and secretary of state reveal it later. Later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, \u201cIf you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same.\u201d\n\nThe administration has asserted that neither the new order nor the old one was a Muslim ban, but rather, a necessary pause in accepting refugees and travelers from certain countries for national security reasons. The judges, though, were apparently unpersuaded. After noting Spicer\u2019s comment, Chuang declared that the mere removal of the religious exception did not \u201ccure\u201d the executive order of its constitutional problems, and asserted: \u201cCrucially, the core policy outcome of a blanket ban on entry of nationals from the Designated Countries remains. When President Trump discussed his planned Muslim ban, he described not the preference for religious minorities, but the plan to ban the entry of nationals from certain dangerous countries as a means to carry out the Muslim ban.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
