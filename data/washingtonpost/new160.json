Gould inquired about how the court should determine if the executive order was \u201ca Muslim ban in the guise of a national security justification.\u201d\n\nProtesters march outside the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, where judges heard arguments on President Trump\u2019s travel ban last week. A different court \u2014 the 9th Circuit \u2014 took up another challenge Monday. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nJudge Richard A. Paez noted that many of Trump\u2019s statements on the matter were made \u201cin the midst of a highly contentious campaign\u201d and asked those suing over the ban, \u201cIf we don\u2019t consider the campaign statements, do you still prevail?\u201d He did, however, deem the campaign trail comments \u201cprofound.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 key sections of which have been frozen by two courts \u2014 tried to temporarily shut down the U.S. refu\u00adgee program and suspend the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThose challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional because it was motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump\u2019s comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case. The Justice Department argues that the executive order is well within the president\u2019s purview and that lower courts have been wrong to second-guess him on a matter of national security.\n\nThe panel of three 9th Circuit judges \u2014 all appointed by President Bill Clinton \u2014 will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in deciding the fate of the ban. To fully reinstate the measure, the Justice Department would have to win in both the 4th and 9th circuits \u2014 or escalate the dispute to the Supreme Court.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises]\n\nOn Monday, acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall told the judges that they need only determine whether there was a \u201crational basis\u201d for the president\u2019s travel ban, and if they thought there was some bad intent, they should focus on official, unequivocal statements as evidence.\n\nWall argued that the president had said \u201cseveral things approaching\u201d a repudiation of his campaign trail comments, in that he had \u201cclarified that what he was talking about were Islamic terrorist groups and the countries that shelter or sponsor them.\u201d But the judges, he said, should nonetheless tread lightly in weighing political remarks.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u201d Wall said.\n\nPressed at the daily briefing Monday about whether the president would repudiate his previous comments, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to answer specifically but insisted that the ban was \u201cfully lawful and will be upheld.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the president is making sure that we make the appropriate arguments to get the ban in place,\u201d Spicer added.\n\nLawyer Neal Katyal, arguing the case on behalf of those who sued over the ban, said the judges should simply ask themselves \u201cwhat would an objective observer think, with these sorts of statements.\u201d\n\nKatyal noted that when Trump signed the first version of his travel ban, which he later revoked and rewrote, the president read the title and commented, \u201cWe all know what that means\u201d \u2014 a post-campaign hint of a discriminatory intention. And after a court blocked the revised order, Katyal said, Trump declared the new measure a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the first.\n\nPressed by Paez on whether the order would be constitutional if it was signed by someone who had not made such comments, Katyal quipped, \u201cIf you don\u2019t say all these things, you never wind up with an executive order like this.\u201d\n\nKatyal allowed, though, that the president would not be forever barred from issuing a similar executive order, if he were to repudiate his previous comments or take other actions to prove that his intent was not to discriminate.\n\nThe 9th Circuit blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban, though the revised version is before a different panel. The 4th Circuit, which is based in Richmond, heard arguments on the matter last week. Their decision and the 9th Circuit\u2019s probably won\u2019t come for weeks.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Michigan ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other advisers \u2014 whose comments judges nationwide have pointed to as they have ordered the ban frozen. That case is separate from the two that have put Trump\u2019s latest ban on hold.\n\n[All the times Trump personally attacked judges \u2014 and why his tirades are \u2018worse than wrong\u2019]\n\nTrump has not been shy about criticizing judges who rule against him, but he seems to have particular ire for the 9th Circuit. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter: \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump then wrote that the circuit had a \u201cterrible record of being overturned\u201d \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \u201cabsolutely\u201d considered breaking up the court.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "lawyers", "judges", "trump", "ban", "circuit", "comments", "appeal", "9th", "court", "trumps", "press", "president"], "summary": "A different court \u2014 the 9th Circuit \u2014 took up another challenge Monday.\nThose challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional because it was motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump\u2019s comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case.\n[President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises]On Monday, acting solicitor general Jeffrey B.\nThe 9th Circuit blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban, though the revised version is before a different panel.\nSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit."}
