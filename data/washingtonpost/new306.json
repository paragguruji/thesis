(Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMo Farah, a runner who was knighted after becoming the most successful track athlete in Britain\u2019s Olympic history, condemned the executive order banning people from certain Muslim-majority countries, saying that \u201cPresident Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.\u201d\n\nThe president signed the order on Friday, and it immediately triggered chaos and uncertainty at American airports. On Saturday night, judicial rulings in several cities blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday in which it said it would continue to enforce the president\u2019s action.\n\n[As dissent grows over travel ban, Trump shows no sign of backing down]\n\nRefugees, migrants and even green-card holders from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are affected, and the order extends to those with dual citizenships. Farah, a British citizen who came from Mogadishu, Somalia, has lived in the United States for the past six years and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at the start of 2017.\n\nLater Sunday, after his Facebook post gained considerable attention, travelers on British passports were advised that dual citizens were affected only if they were traveling to the United States from one of the seven banned countries.\n\n\u201cWe understand from the statement released this evening by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that the executive order will not apply to Mo, and we are grateful to the FCO for urgently clarifying the situation,\u201d a spokesperson for Farah told the BBC. \u201cMo is relieved that he will be able to return to his family once his current training camp concludes. However, as he said in his earlier statement, he still fundamentally disagrees with this incredibly divisive and discriminatory policy.\u201d\n\nFarah \u2014 the 5,000- and 10,000-meter gold medalist in the London and Rio Olypmics \u2014 and his family live in Oregon, where he also trains. He presently is training in Ethiopia and wrote passionately on his Facebook page, saying he might have to tell his children \u201cthat Daddy might not be able to come home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. \u201cI am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years \u2014 working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home \u2014 to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.\u201d \u201cI was welcomed into Britain from Somalia at eight years old and given the chance to succeed and realise my dreams. I have been proud to represent my country, win medals for the British people and receive the greatest honour of a knighthood. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation.\u201d\n\nFacebook reactions to Farah\u2019s post were mixed. \u201cAlways welcome in the UK\u2026.you\u2019re a fantastic man, and a great father, I don\u2019t care what color, race or religion anyone is, we are ALL human, yes, there are bad people, but I have friends from different religions, love them ALL,\u201d Nicci Hart wrote.\n\nAntony Crowe wrote: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t blanket banned every single Muslim in the entire world from entering America, so stop it with your whining propaganda. Next you\u2019ll be telling us that every single Muslim is getting evicted too. The truth is, he\u2019s tightening the immigration policies, like we should do in the UK.\u201d\n\n[NBA asks State Dept. for clarification on behalf of Sudanese players]\n\nFarah, 33, moved to Portland with his family in 2011 to join the Nike Oregon Project, a distance training group coached by Alberto Salazar. Farah, who does not hold a Somali passport, is not scheduled to return to Oregon until March and Salazar had no comment when reached by The Oregonian\n\nMark Parker, the chief executive of Nike, which sponsors Farah, issued a statement Sunday night condemning Trump\u2019s executive order and supporting Farah.\n\n\u201cWhat Mo will always have \u2014 what the entire Nike family can always count on \u2014 is the support of this company,\u201d Parker said in the statement. \u201c. . .
