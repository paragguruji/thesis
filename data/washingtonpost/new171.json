(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, President Trump\u2019s ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries will go into partial effect.\n\nAfter months during which the ban was stayed by federal judges, the Supreme Court this week allowed the administration\u2019s bar on entry for visitors from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to move forward \u2014 with a big caveat. Those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the country, including having a job or being enrolled in college, had to be allowed in. So, too, did those seeking entry who have a close family member in the United States.\n\nWhat\u2019s a close family member? On Wednesday night, the State Department issued guidelines that clarified.\n\n\u201cClose family\u201d is defined as a parent (including parent-in-law), spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, whether whole or half. This includes step relationships. \u201cClose family\u201d does not include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-laws and sisters-in-law, fiances, and any other \u201cextended\u201d family members.\n\nOr, put visually:\n\nIf someone in one of those darker-colored boxes is in the United States, the applicant can gain entry. If not, no dice.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promoted his travel ban as a necessary step to protect the United States from the threat of international terrorism. He celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week on Twitter.\n\nVery grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\n(The decision was not 9-to-0, incidentally.)\n\nNaturally, then, the question arises: How safe will this ban keep us?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to answer, of course, given that we may never know that someone who intended to commit a terrorist act in the United States was denied admission to the country. But we can use past acts as something of a guide.\n\nBelow, a list of successful and attempted terrorist attacks linked to radical Islamic ideology in the United States over the past 20 years, and an assessment of whether the travel ban about to go into effect might have prevented them.\n\nAugust 1997.

One would have had to have been rejected at the age of 2. No deaths would have been prevented.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Trump and his administration have embraced the travel ban as a symbol of their efforts to combat terrorism. It\u2019s not clear, though, that the ban will actually do much to accomplish that goal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "lives", "born", "naturalized", "ban", "opens", "man", "terrorist", "zero", "going", "saved", "prevented", "united", "citizen", "states", "attacks", "20", "effect"], "summary": "So, too, did those seeking entry who have a close family member in the United States.\nOr, put visually:If someone in one of those darker-colored boxes is in the United States, the applicant can gain entry.\nTrump has repeatedly promoted his travel ban as a necessary step to protect the United States from the threat of international terrorism.\nTwo Iraqi nationals are arrested in Bowling Green, Ky., for aiding terrorist attacks outside the United States.\nTwo Iraqi nationals are arrested in Bowling Green, Ky., for aiding terrorist attacks outside the United States."}
