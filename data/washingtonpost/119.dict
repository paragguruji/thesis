Watson pointed to Trump\u2019s own comments and those of his close advisers as evidence that his order was meant to discriminate against Muslims and declared there was a \u201cstrong likelihood of success\u201d that those suing would prove the directive violated the Constitution.\n\nWatson declared that \u201ca reasonable, objective observer \u2014 enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance \u2014 would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.\u201d\n\nHe lambasted the government, in particular, for asserting that because the ban did not apply to all Muslims in the world, it could not be construed as discriminating against Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe illogic of the Government\u2019s contentions is palpable,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cThe notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nEarly Thursday, a federal judge in Maryland issued a second, narrower injunction against the measure \u2014 suspending only the portion that stopped the issuance of visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries. In that case, U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang also pointed to statements by Trump and his advisers made that, in Chuang\u2019s opinion, indicated the executive order was \u201cthe realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese statements, which include explicit, direct statements of President Trump\u2019s animus toward Muslims and intention to impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States, present a convincing case that the First Executive Order was issued to accomplish, as nearly as possible, President Trump\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang wrote.\n\nAt a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, Trump called the Hawaii court ruling \u201cterrible\u201d and asked a cheering crowd whether the ruling was \u201cdone by a judge for political reasons.\u201d He said the administration would fight the case \u201cas far as it needs to go,\u201d including up to the Supreme Court, and rued that he had been persuaded to sign a \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of his first travel ban.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u201d\n\nSarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement: \u201cThe Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court\u2019s ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope. The President\u2019s Executive Order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our Nation\u2019s security, and the Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts.\u201d\n\n(Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nWatson was one of three federal judges to hear arguments Wednesday about the ban, though he was the first to issue an opinion.\n\nA ruling was also expected from a federal judge in Washington.\n\nAs the ruling in Hawaii was being handed down, James L. \u00adRobart, the federal judge in Washington state who froze Trump\u2019s first travel ban, was hearing arguments about whether he should freeze the second. He said he did not think his first freeze was still in effect, though he did not immediately rule on whether he should issue a new one.\n\nWatson\u2019s decision might not be the last word. He was considering only a request for a temporary restraining order, and while that required him to assess whether challengers of the ban would ultimately succeed, his ruling is not final on that question. The Justice Department could appeal the ruling or wage a longer-term court battle before the judge in Hawaii.\n\nWatson\u2019s decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Hawaii. Lawyers for the state alleged that the new entry ban, much like the old, violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it was essentially a Muslim ban, hurt the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent, and damaged the state\u2019s robust tourism industry.\n\nThey pointed to the case of \u00adIsmail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, whose mother-in-law\u2019s application for an immigrant visa was still being processed. Under the new executive order, attorneys for Hawaii said, Elshikh feared that his mother-in-law, a Syrian national, would ultimately be banned from entering the United States.\n\n[Why Hawaii says Trump\u2019s new travel ban is still unconstitutional]\n\n\u201cDr. Elshikh certainly has standing in this case. He, along with all of the Muslim residents in Hawaii, face higher hurdles to see family because of religious faith,\u201d lawyer Colleen Roh Sinzdak said at a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt is not merely a harm to the Muslim residents of the state of Hawaii, but also is a harm to the United States as a whole and is against the First Amendment itself.\u201d\n\nElshikh is a U.S. citizen of Egyptian descent who has been a resident of Hawaii for over a decade. His wife is of Syrian descent and is also a resident of Hawaii.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that Trump was well within his authority to impose the ban, which was necessary for national security, and that those challenging it had raised only speculative harms. \u201cThey bear the burden of showing irreparable harm \u2026 and there is no harm at all,\u201d said the acting U.S. solicitor general, Jeffrey Wall, who argued on behalf of the government in Greenbelt, Md., in the morning and by phone in Hawaii in the afternoon.\n\nWatson agreed with the state on virtually all the points. He ruled that the state had preliminarily demonstrated its universities and tourism industry would be hurt, and that harm could be traced to the executive order. He wrote that Elshikh had alleged \u201cdirect, concrete injuries to both himself and his immediate family.\u201d\n\nAnd Watson declared that the government\u2019s assertion of the national security need for the order was \u201cat the very least, \u2018secondary to a religious objective\u2019 of temporarily suspending the entry of Muslims.\u201d He pointed to Trump\u2019s own campaign trail comments and public statements by advisers as evidence.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there is nothing \u2018veiled\u2019 about this press release: \u2018Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u2019 \u201d Watson wrote. \u201cNor is there anything \u2018secret\u2019 about the Executive\u2019s motive specific to the issuance of the Executive Order. Rudolph Giuliani explained on television how the Executive Order came to be. He said: \u2018When [Mr. Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWatson also pointed to a recent Fox News appearance by Stephen Miller, in which the president\u2019s senior policy adviser said the new ban would have \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d from the previous iteration frozen by the courts, and Americans would see \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order, and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the Executive Order\u2019s stated secular purpose,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nOpponents of the ban across the country \u2014 including those who had argued against it in different cases on Wednesday \u2014 hailed Watson\u2019s ruling.\n\nBob Ferguson, the Washington state attorney general who asked Robart to block the measure, called the Hawaii ruling \u201cfantastic news.\u201d Justin Cox, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center who argued for a restraining order in the case in Maryland, said, \u201cThis is absolutely a victory and should be celebrated as such, especially because the court held that the plaintiffs, that Hawaii was likely to succeed on its establishment clause claim which essentially is that the primary purpose of the executive order is to discriminate against Muslims.\u201d\n\nCox said while the judge did not halt the order entirely, he blocked the crucial sections \u2014 those halting the issuance of new visas and suspending the refu\u00adgee program. Left intact, Cox said, were lesser-known provisions, including one that orders Homeland Security and the U.S. attorney general to publicize information about foreign nationals charged with \u00adterrorism-related offenses and other crimes. He said the provision seems designed to whip up fear of Muslims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shaming device that it\u2019s really a dehumanizing device,\u201d he said. \u201cIt perpetuates this myth, this damaging stereotype of Muslims as terrorists.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s new entry ban had suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and halted for 90 days the issuance of new visas to people from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria. It was different from the first entry ban in that it omitted Iraq from the list of affected countries, did not affect current visa or green-card holders and spelled out a robust list of people who might be able to apply for exceptions.\n\nThe administration could have defended the first ban in court \u2014 though it chose instead to rewrite the president\u2019s executive order in such a way that it might be more defensible. The next step might have been to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to rehear the case en banc, after a three-judge panel with the court upheld the freeze on Trump\u2019s ban.\n\nHawaii is a part of the 9th Circuit, so the legal road could pass through the appeals court there again. Perhaps previewing the contentious fight ahead, five of the circuit\u2019s judges on Wednesday signed a dissenting opinion in the case over the original travel ban, declaring Trump\u2019s decision to issue the executive order was \u201cwell within the powers of the presidency.\u201d The judges wanted to wipe out a ruling by a three-judge panel declaring otherwise.\n\n\u201cAbove all, in a democracy, we have the duty to preserve the liberty of the people by keeping the enormous powers of the national government separated,\u201d Judge Jay S. Bybee wrote for the dissenters. \u201cWe are judges, not Platonic Guardians. It is our duty to say what the law is, and the meta-source of our law, the U.S. Constitution, commits the power to make foreign policy, including the decisions to permit or forbid entry into the United States, to the President and Congress.\u201d\n\nThe dissent was signed by Judges Bybee, Sandra S. Ikuta, Consuelo M. Callahan and Carlos T. Bea, who all were appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Alex Kozinski, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. It seemed to represent a minority view. The circuit has 25 active judges, and the court said a majority had not voted in favor of reconsidering the three-judge panel\u2019s published opinion to keep Trump\u2019s first ban frozen.\n\nThat opinion was signed by Judges Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Obama; Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Carter.\n\nJudge Stephen Reinhardt, also a Carter appointee, formally joined their opinion Wednesday and remarked that only a \u201csmall number\u201d of 9th Circuit judges wanted to overturn it.\n\nTakase reported from Honolulu.
