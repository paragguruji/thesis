Call it, as the president did on Twitter, \u201ckeeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!\u201d\n\nEither way, civil liberties lawyers assert, the executive order temporarily barring the entry of refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries is unconstitutional. But legal analysts say they might have a tough time proving that in court, even with early legal victories and swelling support from people across the country.\n\nAnalysts across the political spectrum say that the president has vast authority to bar the entry of people to the United States, and to do so without the consent of other branches of government.\n\n[Ban or no ban? Trump settles the debate over his executive order.]\n\nThe law states that if the president finds that \u201cthe entry of any aliens\u201d would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the country\u2019s interests, he has broad power to impose restrictions.\n\nThere are good reasons for that, analysts say. If, for example, the residents of a particular country contracted a deadly, contagious disease, \u201cyou would want to shut down travel from that country,\u201d said Leon Fresco, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. Fresco said the same power that gives the president authority to do that seems to give President Trump the authority to enforce his ban.\n\nHis view is not universal. Acting attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, declared this week she would not defend the order \u2014 a decision that led to her firing \u2014 because she was not convinced it was lawful. The ACLU and others have filed several potential class-action claims around the country alleging individual cases of wrongdoing, and attorneys general in four states moved this week to join the burgeoning court battle. Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, has spoken out against the order.\n\nCivil liberties and immigration lawyers are waging a wide-reaching public and legal resistance campaign \u2014 hoping to push the judiciary to overturn what they call antiquated legal precedents and toss the order.\n\nFederal judges have consistently sided with the challengers in early suits, producing a nationwide stoppage on Customs and Border Protection detaining or deporting green-card holders or those with valid visas who arrive at U.S. airports.\n\nA panel of United Nations human rights experts said Wednesday that the order violates the United States\u2019 international human rights obligations. State Department diplomats have signed a memo objecting to Trump\u2019s order, arguing that it will not deter attacks on American soil. After the order first came down, protests erupted at airports across the country. The Homeland Security inspector general announced late Wednesday he would investigation the order\u2019s implementation.\n\n[Civil liberties advocates continue pressing Trump administration on immigration order]\n\nThe mass action, analysts said, is intended both to prevent the White House from trying to marginalize individual judges who rule against the administration, as well to show the many other lives affected by the order. That might push the judiciary to a tipping point to conclude that precedents shaped in a pre-civil rights era \u2014 founded on rulings such as one upholding the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and another approving the expulsion of communists \u2014 no longer apply.\n\n\u201cJudges look at the newspapers, too,\u201d said Peter J. Spiro, a professor of immigration and constitutional law at Temple University. \u201cThe fact that they see spontaneous public unrest about the order, that empowers the courts in pushing back against the administration and finding a way to striking down the law.\u201d\n\nAnthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said in an interview this week he believes the order violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, international treaties and the First Amendment. Of particular significance, he said, is an exception to the refu\u00adgee ban for those who are members of a minority religion and who are fleeing a country.\n\nThat, Romero and others say, seems to favor non-Muslims. And Trump himself said in a recent interview with CBN News that persecuted Christians would be given priority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that we can win, and fortunately, President Trump and those around him make it very easy to reveal that bigotry,\u201d said lawyer Gadeir Abbas, who is among those involved in a broad legal challenge to the order.\n\nThe ACLU is still haggling with the government over a list of people who were detained when the order first went into effect over the weekend. The government said late Tuesday no one was being detained, though some people might be facing extra processing. The ACLU wants an accounting of those who were once held and those who might have been removed after it filed its lawsuit.\n\nThere also remain questions about implementation. Lawyers recently obtained a letter from the State Department that provisionally revokes all nonimmigrant and immigrant visas of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 which they say demonstrates the effect of the order in a way they did not previously understand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking, to say the least,\u201d said Susan Cohen, who is working with the ACLU on a case in Massachusetts.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday the administration would dial back its position on green-card holders from the affected countries. They had initially been allowed in only with waivers, which will no longer be needed, Spicer said.\n\nThe lawsuits challenging the executive order allege that it is essentially a tool for discrimination that damages states\u2019 interests and violates people\u2019s constitutional rights. The problem, analysts said, is that some, though not all, case law suggests noncitizens outside the United States have no such rights. And in a way, all immigration law is essentially discriminatory.\n\n\u201cThe notion that it is unconstitutional to discriminate against foreign nationals based on their national origin is political correctness run amok,\u201d said Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for policy in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cWe admit French nationals without a visa but don\u2019t give the same right to Polish nationals, and we have for decades \u2014 without a constitutional challenge.\u201d\n\nFresco, the Obama Justice Department lawyer, said that although the challengers might argue otherwise, courts are likely to use a low standard to determine whether the order passes muster, essentially asking whether it has any rational basis. The administration, he said, will likely argue that the threat of terrorist attacks justifies the order.\n\nTrump and his aides have cited as evidence in favor of the ban attacks that it probably could not have prevented. But they would face a low burden, analysts said, and have some facts on their side. For example, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, the college student who drove his car into a crowd and then stabbed and slashed people in a spree that injured 11 at Ohio State University in November, was born in Somalia, which is covered by the ban.\n\n\u201cThese are countries where there are active anti-U.S. terrorist organizations operating,\u201d Baker said.\n\nFresco said lawyers for the other side, though, could present evidence that public safety was not the order\u2019s real purpose \u2014 pointing to the chaotic rollout and even public comments by those associated with the administration. Trump promised on the campaign trail a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d \u2014 and that pledge remains on the campaign website. Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a vigorous Trump supporter, used the term \u201cMuslim ban\u201d \u2014 a term Trump now takes issue with \u2014 in talking about the order\u2019s origin in a recent television interview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Giuliani said on Fox News. \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRachel Weiner, Mark Berman, Glenn Kessler and Abby Phillip contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["matter", "analysts", "trump", "ban", "immigration", "overturn", "tough", "president", "trumps", "states", "united", "order", "legal", "administration", "way", "say"], "summary": "But legal analysts say they might have a tough time proving that in court, even with early legal victories and swelling support from people across the country.\nFresco said the same power that gives the president authority to do that seems to give President Trump the authority to enforce his ban.\nA panel of United Nations human rights experts said Wednesday that the order violates the United States\u2019 international human rights obligations.\nThe problem, analysts said, is that some, though not all, case law suggests noncitizens outside the United States have no such rights.\nTrump promised on the campaign trail a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d \u2014 and that pledge remains on the campaign website."}
