(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nIn this occasional series, we will bring you up to speed on the biggest national security stories of the week.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that a limited version of President Trump's original travel ban could go into effect until it considers the case again in the fall. But the decision came with a curious stipulation: Visitors need a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\n\nThe court left it to the government to decide the meaning of that relationship, and details are slowly trickling in on the Trump administration's plans.\n\nThe new criteria for visa applications goes into effect Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWho is affected?\n\nThe travel ban affects visa applicants from six predominantly Muslim nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nVisas will be granted to those who can prove \u2014 in a formal and documented way \u2014 that they have a close relationship with a family member living in the United States or that they are connected with an entity such as a workplace or university.\n\nThe State Department's new guidelines stipulate that a close family member is a parent, spouse, sibling, son, daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Stepfamily relationships also apply.\n\nThe government doesn't consider close relationships to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, fiances and other \u201cextended\u201d family members.\n\nHere's a visual representation from The Washington Post's Philip Bump:\n\nWhat are some of the criticisms of this version of the ban?\n\nOne of the controversies behind the new travel ban is the idea that the government can determine the meaning of a \u201cbona fide\u201d or close relationship.\n\nOfficials also say that individuals will be judged on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis and that the relationship itself will not be the only determining factor. Officials say they will consider cases in which a grandmother or an aunt raised someone now living in the United States.\n\nAnother criticism is that the travel ban as it stands is not an effective policy to protect against terrorism attacks. As The Post's Mark Berman points out, \u201cThere have been 10 fatal attacks in the United States tied to Islamist extremist ideology or otherwise deemed international terrorism since 2001. None of the people behind any of those attacks are from the banned countries (Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen; Iraq was included in the first ban but dropped for the second version).\u201d\n\nWhere did the ban come from, and what happens now?\n\nThis version of the travel ban does not go as far as Trump would have liked.\n\nTrump first signed the executive order in late January that caused panic and chaos at airports because green card- and visa holders were turned back. Immigrants and refugees who were traveling on planes to the United States found themselves stranded and confused, and federal agencies were left to determine the meaning of the order's language without any real guidance from the White House.\n\nNow, officials expect a smoother transition because the latest ban applies only to new visa applicants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court said the Trump administration needs to clarify its policy on vetting procedures before justices come back to the case in October.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments\u201d within 90 days, the court said.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
