Their ruling is another blow to Trump \u2014 although the administration has asked the Supreme Court to to step in and save the ban in a different case.\n\n[Trump\u2019s latest tweets will probably hurt effort to restore travel ban]\n\nTrump fired back Tuesday in a tweet, saying the 9th Circuit \u201cdid it again\u201d by ruling against the travel ban \u201cat such a dangerous time in the history of our country.\u201d As in some previous tweets, Trump wrote out \u201cTRAVEL BAN\u201d in all capitals.\n\nHe ended the message with \u201cS.C.\u201d \u2014 a reference to a possible Supreme Court hearing on the executive order.\n\nThe ruling by the 9th Circuit was both logistically and symbolically important \u2014 keeping in place the broadest blockade on Trump\u2019s order and creating legal and practical paths for the directive to die.\n\nUnlike other courts in the past, the three judges did not dwell on Trump\u2019s public comments, nor did they declare that the president had run afoul of the Constitution because his intent was to discriminate. Instead, they ruled that the travel ban lacked a sufficient national security or other justification that would make it legal, and that violated immigration law.\n\nThey offered no opinion on whether the ban was constitutional.\n\n\u201cThere is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cThese identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that he disagreed with the court\u2019s decision and that the president was within his authority to issue the order.\n\n\u201cRecent attacks confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPresident Trump knows that the country he has been elected to lead is threatened daily by terrorists who believe in a radical ideology, and that there are active plots to infiltrate the U.S. immigration system \u2014 just as occurred prior to 9/11. The President is committed to protecting the American people and our national security, and we are proud to support his mission to put America first by defending his right to keep us safe. That is why the Department of Justice will continue to seek further review by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nNeal Katyal, one of the lawyers representing those challenging the ban, said on Twitter that the decision was a \u201ccomplete win\u201d and noted it was different from previous victories in other cases.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nAlthough the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had upheld a separate freeze on Trump\u2019s ban on constitutional grounds, that freeze did not apply to the portion of Trump\u2019s order dealing with refugees. The 9th Circuit was considering a freeze that did, and concluded that Trump had not provided sufficient justification to either temporarily suspend refu\u00adgee admission or lower the refu\u00adgee cap for fiscal 2017 to 50,000.\n\nThe opinion also clarified that the administration could conduct an internal review to assess vetting procedures.\n\nThat could be construed as a victory for Trump: The appeals court said a federal judge in Hawaii was wrong to restrict his administration from conducting such a review. But Hawaii, which had successfully challenged the ban, earlier in the day had told the Supreme Court it had no objection to such a move.\n\n\u201cThe executive is free to engage in any manner of study, review, upgrade or revision of its existing vetting procedures,\u201d the state argued, adding, \u201cso long as the order did not use these provisions to justify or expand a veiled Muslim ban, they would survive judicial review.\u201d\n\nIf the travel ban is to be salvaged, the Supreme Court would have to move quickly.\n\n[Trump proposed a 120-day travel ban to improve vetting. It\u2019s been 129 days.]\n\nThat is because the measure is supposed to be temporary \u2014 barring the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending the U.S. refu\u00adgee program for 120 days so officials could review vetting procedures. The Justice Department had said it felt blocked from conducting a review by the Hawaii judge, meaning the clock had essentially stopped.\n\nThat clock will presumably now run again, though whether it will start from 90 or something short of that remains unclear. With a Supreme Court recess looming, the ban could expire before the justices reach a decision \u2014 unless they grant the Justice Department\u2019s request to stay the injunctions on the ban.\n\nTrump seemed to suggest on Twitter recently, though, that he viewed the measure not as a temporary one.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d he wrote last week. Trump\u2019s press secretary had previously disputed calling the measure a ban, and the Justice Department has sought in court to characterize it as a \u201ctemporary pause.\u201d\n\nMost Supreme Court practitioners and experts said they would be surprised if the court turned down a petition from the government on a matter of national security \u2014 though the justices might feel less pressure to come to a decision on the merits of the executive order before the end of June.\n\nIn a filing with the court Monday concerning the 4th Circuit decision, ACLU lawyer Omar C. Jadwat said the administration had shown by its actions that there was no immediate danger to the country in not having the travel ban in place. And he argued there is a \u201clooming mootness\u201d question because no court has stayed the executive order in its entirety. Jadwat asserted the order is set to expire June 14.\n\nThe ACLU filing said the 4th Circuit, and other courts that have halted the executive order, had little choice. \u201cTo allow the ban to go forward, the courts would have had to ignore a mountain of publicly available evidence \u2014 even though everyone else in the country, including those of the disfavored faith, could not ignore it. They would have had to set aside this Court\u2019s precedents and turn their backs on their traditional and crucial role in disputes where constitutional liberties are at stake.\u201d\n\nThe 9th Circuit opinion was written by judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez, all appointed by President Bill Clinton. They heard arguments in the case last month and focused much of their questioning on the president\u2019s campaign trail and other public comments, which other judges have cited as evidence the president meant to discriminate against Muslims in imposing a ban.\n\nTrump earlier this month doubled down on some of those comments, deriding the revised travel ban as a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the first and calling the new measure \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d Legal analysts said that might ultimately hurt his case; one tweet was cited in a footnote in Monday\u2019s opinion.\n\nIn their ruling, though, the 9th Circuit judges criticized the Trump administration not for its public opining, but for its lack of a real justification for the directive.\n\nThe latest version of the ban \u2014 which Trump signed after revoking an order that banned residents of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 describes conditions in the countries affected and says that more than 300 people who entered the country as refugees were the subject of active counterterrorism investigations.\n\n[Trump administration\u2019s latest rationale for travel ban: National security officials asked for it]\n\nThe judges noted that a Department of Homeland Security report concluded citizenship was an \u201cunreliable\u201d threat indicator, and most foreign-born extremists are radicalized years after coming to the United States. The judges said the president had broad authority to set immigration policy, but it was \u201cnot unlimited.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, the Order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cNational security is not a \u2018talismanic incantation\u2019 that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201d\n\nThe 9th Circuit was the court that upheld the freeze on Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and it has since become a focus of the president\u2019s ire.\n\nWhen U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter: \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump then wrote that the circuit had a \u201cterrible record of being overturned\u201d \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \u201cabsolutely\u201d considered breaking up the court.\n\nBrian Murphy contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "type": "article"}
