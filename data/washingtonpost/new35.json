Within days of President Trump\u2019s first executive order restricting travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, a number of European travel groups pulled their plans, amounting to a loss of 2,000 overnight stays for Hostelling International USA.\n\nThe ban would complicate travel for citizens of the countries cited \u2014 among them Iran, Syria and Libya. But Canadians and Europeans and others were dropping their plans, too. As group organizers put it, people suddenly had an unsettling sense that the United States wasn\u2019t as welcoming a place as it once was.\n\nThe result was a wave of withdrawals. \u201cGetting those cancellations all at once, that was startling,\u201d said Russ Hedge, chief executive of HI USA, which oversees 52 hostels across the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like that.\u201d\n\nFrom hostels to major hotel chains such as Marriott, tour group operators to outfits that cater to business travelers, the toll of Trump\u2019s proposals on the nation\u2019s tourism industry has been swift. Some say long-term damage has been done.\n\nAnd it could be compounded by recent reports of Trump administration plans to implement \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of foreign travelers. Visitors \u2014 including those from allies such as France and Germany \u2014 could be pressed to turn over mobile phone contacts, social media passwords and financial records, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban is only a negative at this point,\u201d said Michael Bellisario, an analyst for the investment bank Robert W. Baird & Co. \u201cIt hurts travel, regardless of whether we\u2019re talking about one of the six banned countries or not,\u201d he said, referring to the second, revised entry ban.\n\nDemand for flights to the United States has fallen in nearly every country since January, \u00adaccording to Hopper, a travel-booking app that analyzes more than 10 billion daily airfare price quotes to derive its data. Searches for U.S. flights from China and Iraq have dropped 40 percent since Trump\u2019s inauguration, while demand in Ireland and New Zealand is down about 35 percent. (One exception: Russia, where searches for flights to the United States have surged 60 percent since January.)\n\nThe result could be an estimated 4.3 million fewer people coming to the United States this year, resulting in $7.4 billion in lost revenue, according to Tourism Economics, a Philadelphia-based analytics firm. Next year, the fallout is expected to be even larger, with 6.3 million fewer tourists and $10.8 billion in losses. Miami is expected to be hit hardest, followed by San Francisco and New York, the firm said.\n\nThe administration\u2019s travel ban deals a blow to an industry that has only recently recovered from a $600 billion loss following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of 9/11, at first people didn\u2019t feel safe coming here, and then they didn\u2019t feel welcome,\u201d said Jonathan Grella, an executive vice president at the U.S. Travel Association. \u201cOur industry still refers to that as \u2018the lost decade.\u2019 There is a very real risk that that could happen again.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlight attendants in Los Angeles watch a protest of the immigration ban imposed by President Trump.

(Stephen Lam/Getty Images)\n\nBroad-based apprehension\n\nAs anecdotal evidence mounts, industry experts say it\u2019s increasingly clear that travelers from all over \u2014 Canada and Mexico, Europe and Asia \u2014 are rethinking their plans to visit the United States.\n\nMarriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, has noted a 15 percent drop in bookings from Mexico to the United States. Meanwhile, bookings from the Middle East to the United States fell about 30 percent in February. The strong dollar, executives said, contributed to a decline in international travel to the United States.\n\nMike McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, said that following Trump\u2019s first travel order, there was a \u201cpronounced drop in bookings,\u201d resulting in estimated losses of $185 million.\n\n\u201cIt hurts the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have discretion in moving meetings and events to other places. They don\u2019t have to be in New York or Chicago or here in the U.S.\u201d\n\n[Worried about Trump\u2019s travel ban, Canada\u2019s largest school district calls off U.S. trips]\n\nFifteen miles from the White House, the Sheraton Tysons Hotel is now offering a free Apple Watch to anybody who books a meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get through this storm,\u201d said Chris Zindash, the hotel\u2019s director of sales and marketing.\n\nConcerned guests have been calling for weeks, he said, and a group from Asia recently backed out of a long-planned visit.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of apprehension,\u201d Zindash said, \u201ca lot of fear that people will arrive here and the gates will be closed.\u201d\n\nAt Hostelling International, among the first to cancel was a British-based youth group that had planned a trip for 400 to the East Coast this summer. The three-week gathering, called Merit360, was to culminate in presentations to the United Nations.\n\nBut then Trump issued his first travel ban. Nearly 80 citizens of the affected countries had already paid their deposits for the annual trip. The year before, when Barack Obama was president and there were no such bans in place, nearly 200 of the organization\u2019s 550 participants had failed to acquire proper visas for their trip. This year was bound to be much worse.\n\n\u201cThis has been a setback on so many levels,\u201d said Marlou Herm\u00adsen, chief operating officer of World Merit, which oversees the program. \u201cWhen the first ban was announced, that\u2019s when we thought: It\u2019s real. We\u2019re not welcome anymore.\u201d\n\nTwo-thirds of participants voted to move the gathering to Britain, with plans to meet with Parliament in London instead of the United Nations in New York.\n\nGrella, of the U.S. Travel Association, says it\u2019s not so much the executive orders that bother him, but the fact that the U.S. government hasn\u2019t made an effort to reassure international travelers.\n\n\u201cAll it takes is a little rebranding: \u2018Here\u2019s who\u2019s no longer welcome for the time being, but for everybody else, yes, we\u2019re open for business,\u2019 \u201d Grella said. \u201cThe ripple effects of this are very real. We\u2019ve unnecessarily ruffled a lot of feathers.\u201d\n\n[With Brand USA, a campaign to lure foreign tourists \u2014 and their money]\n\n\n\nPeople protest and welcome arriving passengers at Washington Dulles International Airport.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nBorder businesses\n\nSince Trump announced the ban, Marie Aguado has canceled three trips: business travel to Los Angeles, a visit to see her brother in Austin and a family vacation to Disney World.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re afraid to leave,\u201d said Aguado, an American who lives in Mexico City with her French-born husband and two daughters. She asked to be identified by her middle and last names for fear of government retribution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dead serious about not going home,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the ban happened, I was thinking of my children.\u201d\n\nAguado\u2019s oldest daughter was born in Dubai. The other was born in Mexico City. Both are also French citizens.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking they\u2019re going to see my daughter was born in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then what\u2019s going to happen? I got totally freaked out and said to my brother, \u2018I\u2019m not coming to see you anymore. Come see me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJust one more wrinkle, she said: Her brother\u2019s wife is a green-card holder from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid to travel, too,\u201d Aguado said.\n\nThat fear of leaving \u2014 and re-entering \u2014 the United States has led to a slowdown in traffic to Mexican border cities, which have long been popular destinations for shoppers and those seeking cheaper health care.\n\n[Worried about Trump\u2019s travel ban, Canada\u2019s largest school district calls off U.S. trips]\n\nFrancisco Vazquez Michel, a Mexican dentist in the border town of Nogales, said that 80 percent of his clients are Mexicans or Hispanics living in the United States, who cross the border for less-expensive care. Now about half as many as usual are coming, he said.\n\n\u201cThey are very afraid, and it\u2019s fear that Donald Trump put into Mexicans,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day, not long ago, all of our appointments [were] canceled in one day, because the rumor went around that if people crossed, they would lose their visas.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Nogales chamber of commerce, Carlos Jimenez Robles, said that the number of shoppers crossing into Mexico had dropped by 40 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a hardening by border agents, where they have more questions for people, more doubts about who people are,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cNot only with tourists, also with American citizens.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite this sort of welcome at some U.S. airports, foreign travelers are changing their plans and rebooking their trips to steer away from U.S. cities. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not anti-American\u2019\n\nNot everybody reported an immediate slowdown in business.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t made a difference to us,\u201d said Nayan Patel, owner of the Georgetown Inn in Washington. \u201cAmerica is still America \u2014 we\u2019re still a democratic country full of opportunity \u2014 and that\u2019s enough to get people to come here.\u201d\n\nSmall World Vacations, a travel agency in New Jersey that specializes in Disney vacations, hasn\u2019t noticed much of a drop-off, either. It has received just one cancellation this year, from an Iranian American with a German passport. He didn\u2019t want to leave on a Disney cruise to the Bahamas out of fear he wouldn\u2019t be allowed back into the country, said Sue Pisaturo, the agency\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cWe do get our share of international travelers from every country \u2014 even countries I\u2019ve never heard of \u2014 but so far it\u2019s business as usual,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case, though, at Westmount High School in Montreal. Seniors there had been planning their graduation trip for months.\n\n\u201cWe usually go to New York but decided this year to go to Washington,\u201d teacher Sabrina \u00adJafralie said. \u201cThe kids were overjoyed.\u201d\n\nThey were drawn to the capital, she said, by the new African American History museum and were interested in visiting the Holocaust Museum.\n\nOne hundred students signed up. Then the Trump travel ban hit. Jafralie, who is Canadian-born but whose father emigrated from India 40 years ago, realized that four of the students were from Iran. They held Canadian visas but weren\u2019t Canadian citizens. Students from Pakistan and Sri Lanka also expressed concern.\n\nThey had read a number of media reports about people being stopped at the U.S. border for long interrogations. A Montreal-area woman wearing a hijab was blocked from going on a day-long shopping trip to Vermont, while a Canadian-born woman of Indian descent was told she would need a visa to enter the United States for a weekend spa visit.\n\nAfter long, sometimes agonizing discussions with her students \u2014 Jafralie teaches ethics \u2014 they agreed to go to Toronto instead.\n\n\u201cWe decided that we were not prepared to leave any students behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political boycott on our part. We\u2019re not anti-Trump. We\u2019re not anti-American. We\u2019re anti-not-being-together. We\u2019re a family, and we travel together.\u201d\n\nAlan Freeman in Ottawa and Joshua Partlow in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmericans are more split on the Trump travel ban than you might think\n\nHe bought Trump\u2019s childhood home for $1.4 million \u2014 and flipped it weeks later for a yuge profit\n\nFrench manicures, Bud Light and fly fishing: How Trump staffers are changing Washington\n\nA Trump voter\u2019s message to retailers: \u2018Keep your mouths shut about our president\u2019", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-04-14", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "international", "trump", "ban", "plans", "travelers", "united", "trips", "trumps", "states", "president", "canadians", "skipping"], "summary": "San Francisco is one city expected to lose tourism dollars this year after President Trump promoted a travel ban.\nThe administration\u2019s travel ban deals a blow to an industry that has only recently recovered from a $600 billion loss following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nThe strong dollar, executives said, contributed to a decline in international travel to the United States.\nBut then Trump issued his first travel ban.\nThen the Trump travel ban hit."}
