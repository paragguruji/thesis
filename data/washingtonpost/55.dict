(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nNot long after a federal judge froze his entry ban the first time around, President Trump took to Twitter to issue an ominous warning. With the ban no longer in place, Trump wrote, \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.\u201d Before the sun rose the next day, lawyers at the Justice Department asked a higher court to \u2014 on an emergency basis \u2014 halt the ruling of the lower judge and let the ban take effect.\n\nThe speed with which the administration moved was befitting of the national security crisis the ban purported to address. The administration ultimately lost in court, and since then, it has slowed the pace considerably, putting off a rewrite of the executive order several times and now proceeding more gradually as it fights court-imposed suspensions of the new ban.\n\nLegal analysts and opponents say the Justice Department is likely pursuing a more methodical, strategic approach in hopes of a long-term victory \u2014 although in the process, the administration is hurting its case that the order is needed for urgent national security.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t try to move the case as quickly as possible,\u201d said Leon Fresco, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department, \u201cit does undermine the security rationale.\u201d\n\n[Revised Trump immigration order, delayed after speech, will not ban citizens from Iraq]\n\nTrump\u2019s new travel order \u2014 which suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and blocked the issuance of new visas to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Somalia and Syria for 90 days \u2014 was supposed to take effect March 16, but U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii blocked the administration from enforcing the critical sections of it. Early the next day, a federal judge in Maryland issued a similar ruling \u2014 leaving the administration with two different cases, in two different appellate circuits, that they would need to get overturned before they could begin carrying out the president\u2019s directive. All roads seemed to lead to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut now it seems all but certain that the president\u2019s revised entry ban will stay suspended at least into April, and possibly longer.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal in the Maryland case a day after the judge there ruled, but \u2014 unlike last time \u2014 they did not ask the higher court to immediately set aside the freeze on the new ban. They said they will do so Friday, but those challenging the ban will have a week to respond, and the Justice Department will then be allowed to file more written arguments by April 5.\n\nThe Trump administration has been content to let the court battle play out even more slowly in Hawaii, not elevating the dispute beyond a lower-court judge. The Justice Department has not filed a notice of its intent to appeal the ruling, and the next hearing in that case is set for March 29. Justice Department lawyers wrote Thursday that they would appeal to a higher court if that hearing doesn\u2019t resolve in their favor. The courts will ultimately have to decide important questions, including how much authority they have to weigh in on the president\u2019s national security determinations, whether Trump\u2019s order was meant to discriminate against Muslims, and whether and how the president\u2019s and his advisers\u2019 own comments can be used against them.\n\nThere could be strategic reasons for pumping the brakes. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, said the Justice Department might be hoping for a favorable ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, of which Maryland is a part, before they bring a case before the 9th Circuit, of which Hawaii is a part. A three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit unanimously rejected the administration\u2019s bid to restore Trump\u2019s first entry ban after it was frozen. The 4th Circuit on Thursday scheduled oral argument in its case for May 8.\n\nAnd the Justice Department could be playing an even longer game, hoping that by the time the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch will have joined the justices and brought to an end what many see as a 4-to-4 split along ideological lines, said Jonathan E. Meyer, a former deputy general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security under Obama who now works in private practice at Sheppard Mullin.\n\n\u201cI think this ultimately goes to the Supreme Court, and I think it is likely to find a Supreme Court that is much more open to the government\u2019s arguments once Judge Gorsuch is confirmed and sworn in,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite possible that part of what is going on right now is slowing things down to allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nThe delay, though, undercuts one of the president\u2019s primary arguments for the ban: that it is temporary and needed for national security while the administration reevaluates its vetting procedures for foreign travelers. Officials have had since Jan. 27 to conduct such a review, though Watson\u2019s ruling in Hawaii seems to now stop them from doing so now.\n\nFresco, the former Obama administration official who works in private practice at Holland & Knight, said he wonders why the administration has not simply unveiled new vetting procedures and done away entirely with a temporary ban \u2014 unless its ultimate goal is a long-term ban.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to do a ban, and the ban was supposed to be permanent, then all of this would make sense,\u201d Fresco said.\n\n[7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court]\n\nAsked for comment for this report, a Justice Department spokeswoman referred a reporter to the department\u2019s request for an expedited briefing schedule in the appeal of the Maryland case.\n\nAfter Trump signed his first entry ban on Jan. 27, the measure took effect so suddenly that people aboard flights were detained and, in some cases, deported, when they arrived at U.S. airports, sparking confusion, protests and legal challenges. To implement the directive \u2014 which banned entry to all refugees and citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Somalia and Syria \u2014 the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas. Trump wrote on Twitter that such dramatic and sudden steps were necessary because of what might happen if people were given advance warning.\n\n\u201cf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cA lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d\n\nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nJudges quickly ruled against the measure, stopping U.S. officials from detaining and deporting those who made it to the United States. Then, on Feb. 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Washington state froze the order almost entirely. As Justice Department lawyers prepared an appeal, Trump tweeted several times the following day about the consequences of the judge\u2019s decision, even suggesting the judiciary might be responsible if someone were to launch an attack.\n\n\u201cBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision,\u201d he wrote. He added later: \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d\n\nBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nThe Justice Department made a bid to get Robart\u2019s order put on hold, but lost. Several days later, on Feb. 9, they were handed a more significant defeat when a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declared unanimously that Robart was right.\n\nInstead of taking the case even higher, the administration essentially backed down, declaring a new order would be written and then repeatedly putting it off. Trump or White House officials thrice promised a new order was coming, only to delay signing it until the week that followed.\n\nThe new order was substantially different from the first, blocking only the issuance of new visas and spelling out a robust list of people who could be exempted. It also removed Iraq from the list of affected countries. But Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer who is involved in the Maryland case, said the government\u2019s delays \u201cat every stage of the Muslim ban process, including issuing the revised order, has suggested that they don\u2019t actually believe that there\u2019s an urgent need for the bans to go into effect.\u201d Fresco said the administration seemed to be prioritizing a long-term win in court, and Trump probably felt \u201che\u2019s already made his explanation to the American people that he\u2019s tried, that he\u2019s doing as much as he can.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last thing they want to do is have this travel ban issue, especially on an expedited basis, and lose again,\u201d Fresco said.\n\n[Trump\u2019s new travel ban still wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly U.S. terror attacks]\n\nFormer diplomats and national security professionals have long called into question the necessity of Trump\u2019s entry ban as a public safety measure \u2014 even in its revised form. More than 130 former U.S. officials, among them Cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and generals, recently sent a letter to the administration warning that the directive would actually damage national security. Internal data available to the administration also appears to be in conflict with the reasons officials have given publicly for it. One report, which analyzed 90 cases of suspected or confirmed foreign-born terrorists, found most became extremists after they got to the United States, as opposed to arriving with nefarious intentions.\n\nThe executive order itself says that more than 300 people who came to the United States as refugees are now the subjects of FBI counterterrorism investigations. Separately, it highlights hundreds of people \u201cborn abroad\u201d who were convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States and points to two separate cases involving refugees from Iraq and Somalia. It also describes the conditions in each of the Muslim-majority countries whose citizens, if the ban were to take effect, would no longer be able to get new visas.\n\nThe president has broad authority to set immigration policy, and analysts said it is possible that Trump will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court. How soon that will be, though, remains decidedly unclear.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet \u2014 and it\u2019s becoming a real problem\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-23", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
