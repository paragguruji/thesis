The court will also hold a hearing on the case in the fall. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday granted the Trump administration permission to implement a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban on the citizens of six Muslim-majority countries. But immigrant and refugee rights advocates have broadly divergent views of what that means for the policy that opponents have branded a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nIn its unsigned opinion, the court wrote that the ban \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\u201d \u2014 a new qualifier to an executive order that the administration has repeatedly amended to limit its scope in the face of legal challenges.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations that have challenged Trump\u2019s travel ban in court said the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d clause applies to most successful visa applicants from the six countries.\n\n\u201cThis order, properly construed, should really allow for only the narrowest implementation of any part of the ban,\u201d Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s immigrants\u2019 rights project, said Monday during a conference call with reporters.\n\nRefugees awaiting resettlement through American nonprofit organizations, current visa-holders, students seeking to attend American universities, foreigners hired to work on U.S. soil, and the relatives of those already living here, among other examples, should be exempt from any enforcement of the ban, according to their reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the advocates said.\n\n[What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban ruling means]\n\nBut other groups such as Amnesty International USA saw it differently, and warned that the court\u2019s decision would lead to a fresh bout of \u201cchaos\u201d at airports, and an enforcement of the ban that would \u201ctear families apart.\u201d\n\nAnd human rights groups called on Congress \u201cto step in immediately to nullify [the ban] once and for all\u201d \u2014 or risk further chaos.\n\n\u201cReinstating any part of this ban could create chaos in the nation\u2019s airports and tear families apart,\u201d Margaret Huang, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee, which provides refugee assistance, said the court\u2019s decision will impact \u201cinnocent, security-vetted refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the US: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president and former British foreign secretary, David Miliband.\n\nAnd the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Washington-based Muslim advocacy group, said the court\u2019s decision \u201cignores the Islamophobic origins of the policy and emboldens Islamophobes in the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first iteration of the ban in January sought to block entry to refugees, immigrants and other nationals \u2014 including permanent legal residents of the United States \u2014 who held citizenship in Yemen, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. The ban\u2019s blanket enforcement set off a wave of detentions, deportations and the mass revocation of visas, and it provoked chaotic scenes of protest and confusion at airports across the country.\n\n[The Supreme Court sided with Trinity Lutheran Church. Here\u2019s why that matters.]\n\nThe ACLU and other advocacy groups involved in lawsuits against the ban said they didn\u2019t expect the same chaos to ensue this time because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had restricted the policy so much that it would affect only a small number of people.\n\n\u201cIt should only apply to pending visas. And in the entire universe of pending visas, there is only one that doesn\u2019t involve a tie\u201d to someone or something in the United States \u2014 a tourist visa, said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), the plaintiff in IRAP v. Trump, the full case of which the Supreme Court will hear in October.\n\nBut Heller and other advocates also said they will closely monitor the enforcement of the limited travel ban, given the possibility that the administration may interpret the court\u2019s decision differently. They said refugee and immigrant advocacy groups would be prepared to file new lawsuits over any perceived abuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really important to us over this intervening period to make sure that the government abides by the terms of the order and is not going to use it as a back door to implement the full-scale Muslim ban that it\u2019s been seeking to implement throughout the presidency,\u201d said Jadwat.\n\n\u201cI think the government will be shooting itself in the foot if it does decide to take this as some kind of license to apply the ban aggressively,\u201d he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "courts", "allows", "ban", "supreme", "visas", "refugee", "court", "enforcement", "aclu", "groups", "narrowest", "decision"], "summary": "The Supreme Court on June 26 decided to allow a limited version of President Trump's travel ban to be implemented.\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)The Supreme Court on Monday granted the Trump administration permission to implement a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban on the citizens of six Muslim-majority countries.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations that have challenged Trump\u2019s travel ban in court said the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d clause applies to most successful visa applicants from the six countries.\n[The Supreme Court sided with Trinity Lutheran Church.\nBut Heller and other advocates also said they will closely monitor the enforcement of the limited travel ban, given the possibility that the administration may interpret the court\u2019s decision differently."}
