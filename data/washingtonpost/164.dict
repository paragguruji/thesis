Robart had ordered Trump administration lawyers to submit a brief by 4:30 p.m. Pacific time Tuesday in the Seattle lawsuit. He could rule that his injunction on the ban remains in effect, despite changes in the revised order.\n\nEither way, lawyers said the hearing in Greenbelt, Md., will be critical to the part of the executive order that deals with refu\u00adgee programs, because Robart\u2019s ruling did not apply to that section.\n\nRefugee rights organizations in the Maryland case are seeking to halt the president\u2019s entire executive order and warn the United States is already nearing Trump\u2019s new refu\u00adgee limit.\n\nAs of last week, more than 37,000 refugees had been admitted to the United States, according to the State Department. Lawyers say Trump\u2019s order leaves 60,000 other refugees \u2014 and the organizations that help them \u2014 in the lurch this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThat makes their ability to carry out their mission nearly impossible,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the National Immigration Law Center, which is arguing the Maryland case with the ACLU and others. \u201cThey have to basically scramble to try to find safe housing for individuals who are in very dangerous and precarious situations.\u201d\n\nIn February, Robart suspended Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 entry ban, a broad executive order that suspended the refu\u00adgee program, halted travel for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including those who already had been issued visas, and triggered chaos and protests at airports worldwide.\n\nWhen Robart froze Trump\u2019s original executive order, the president criticized him on Twitter, declaring him a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and deeming his ruling \u201cridiculous.\u201d But a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously upheld the judge\u2019s decision and kept Trump\u2019s entry ban on hold.\n\nInstead of appealing, Trump issued a revised order on March 6. The Justice Department has said the new measure supersedes the restraining order imposed on the initial ban, and will be enforced starting Thursday.\n\n[What Trump changed in the new travel ban]\n\nTrump\u2019s new order reduces the list of affected countries from seven to six \u2014 removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria. The order blocks the issuance of new visas for 90 days \u2014 exempting those with green cards or visas in hand \u2014 and spells out a robust list of people who could apply for exemptions. The order maintains a 120-day freeze on the refugee program and slashes the number to be admitted this year.\n\nOn Monday, the state of Washington asked the court to stop the administration from carrying out the latest executive order.\n\n\u201cInjunctions are not suggestions,\u201d lawyers for the state of Washington wrote. \u201cWhen a court enjoins a defendant from enforcing policies, the defendant cannot evade the injunction by announcing that it will continue only some of the illegal policies.\u201d\n\nThe new order undoubtedly reduces the number of people with standing to sue. But civil liberties advocates and others say it is still legally problematic. Washington and other states have said the order imposes economic harm on them, and that, like the first ban, it is unconstitutional because it is intended to discriminate against Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that this administration from the beginning has said that its intent was to discriminate against Muslims and shut out Muslims,\u201d said Cecilia Wang, the ACLU\u2019s deputy legal director.\n\nFederal officials have disputed that characterization and said the order is necessary for national security. The administration also argues that there is no need to freeze the order while people challenge it in court because it does \u201cno imminent harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo visa is revoked. No lawful permanent resident traveling abroad is barred from returning,\u201d the Justice Department said in a brief filed Monday in the Maryland lawsuit. \u201cNobody lawfully in the United States loses any prior ability to leave the country to travel and later return. . . . Plaintiffs, in short, identify no cataclysm that will befall them on March 16 or any time soon thereafter.\u201d\n\nSirine Shebaya, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Dulles Justice Coalition, a group of mostly lawyers who mobilized after Trump\u2019s initial ban in January, said the organization is preparing for another wave of chaos and confusion at airports around the world.\n\nThe group has maintained a skeleton staff at Dulles International Airport since the first order, but Shebaya said it will return in larger numbers Thursday. Other groups are planning protests at the airport on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to ramp up our presence,\u201d she said.\n\nRefu\u00adgee rights organizations say Trump\u2019s executive orders are putting families fleeing war and other dangers at risk.\n\n\u201cEssentially the door is slamming shut,\u201d said Kay Bellor, vice president for programs at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service , the second-largest refugee-resettlement agency in the United States. \u201cWho knows what cues other countries will take if we just shut the door?\u201d\n\nAbigail Hauslohner contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
