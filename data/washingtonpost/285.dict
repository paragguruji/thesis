Lawyers representing Hawaii in the state\u2019s long-running fight against Trump administration travel bans have filed a motion seeking to challenge the latest version of the policy. Hawaii filed a motion Friday, Oct. 6, 2017 asking a federal judge to lift his order halting the state\u2019s previous lawsuit. Hawaii says it wants to file an amended lawsuit targeting the third travel ban. (Caleb Jones, File/Associated Press)\n\nHONOLULU \u2014 A federal judge on Friday said he would give Hawaii an opportunity to make its case that it should be allowed to challenge the Trump administration\u2019s latest travel ban.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson said Hawaii would have until Tuesday morning to file a new motion. The government will have until Saturday, Oct. 14, to respond.\n\nThe latest travel ban removes Sudan from the list of affected countries and adds Chad and North Korea, along with several officials from the government of Venezuela. It\u2019s scheduled to take effect Oct. 18.\n\n\u201cHawaii fought the first and second travel bans because they were illegal and unconstitutional efforts to implement the president\u2019s Muslim ban,\u201d Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the third travel ban is more of the same.\u201d\n\nThe motion said the new version of travel ban \u201cflouts the immigration laws\u2019 express prohibition on nationality discrimination, grossly exceeds the authority Congress delegated to the president, lacks any rational connection to the problems it purports to address and seems to effectuate the president\u2019s promise to ban Muslims from the United States.\u201d\n\nChin has been battling President Donald Trump on travel bans since February, after the president sought to bar new visas for people from seven mostly Muslim countries.\n\nThe state later amended that lawsuit to add a plaintiff: the imam of a Honolulu mosque. Hawaii has roughly 5,000 Muslims.\n\nWhen Trump revised the ban, Chin amended the lawsuit to challenge that version.\n\nIn March, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu agreed with Hawaii that the ban amounted to discrimination based on nationality and religion.\n\nA subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed the administration to partially reinstate a 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling exempted a large number of refugees and travelers with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the U.S.\n\nHawaii successfully challenged the federal government\u2019s definition of which family members would be allowed into the country. Watson ordered the government not to enforce the ban on close relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts.\n\nAn attorney representing Hawaii notified the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday that the state intends to challenge the third travel ban.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
