(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration filed court papers Friday hoping to salvage its second version of a travel ban after two judges in separate cases this week found that it probably violated the Constitution.\n\nThe Justice Department filed papers in federal court in Maryland, setting up a new legal showdown in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, located in Richmond.\n\nThis week, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued orders against the travel ban, finding that it violated the First Amendment by disfavoring a particular religion. If the Justice Department had appealed the Hawaii order, the case would have gone to the same San Francisco-based appeals court that rejected an earlier version of the travel ban.\n\nWilliam Jay, a former Justice Department lawyer specializing in appellate cases, said the government may have a very simple reason for challenging the Maryland case first: The judge there issued a preliminary injunction, which is more easily appealed in federal courts than temporary restraining orders like the one issued in Hawaii.\n\nThere may be another strategic reason to challenge the Maryland case first, said University of Richmond law professor Kevin Walsh.\n\nIn Richmond, Walsh said, \u201cthe government has the benefit of a fresh set of eyes, unclouded by a precedent of the prior order.\u201d\n\nHe added that a ruling reversing the Maryland injunction could \u201ccast doubt on the enforceability in the 4th Circuit of the Hawaii judge\u2019s order that purports to reach nationwide.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Walsh cautioned that if the administration were to win its case in Richmond, that could, at least in theory, set up a confusing situation in which the travel ban was enforced in one part of the country but not another.\n\nCritics of the executive order call it an attempt to fulfill President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. The administration denies it is a Muslim ban and says the order aims to prevent terrorism by blocking visitors from terror-prone countries where screening of individuals seeking U.S. visas may not be effective.\n\nOmar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer representing plaintiffs in the Maryland case, said that the president\u2019s executive order \u201chas fared miserably in the courts, and for good reason \u2014 it violates fundamental provisions of our Constitution. We look forward to defending this careful and well-reasoned decision in the appeals court.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, ruled against the first version of Trump\u2019s executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program and temporarily barring visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries: Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. A three-judge panel found that executive order violated the due process rights of people who had previously been approved to visit the United States.\n\nIn response to the legal setback, the White House crafted a new version that dropped Iraq from the list of countries and exempted holders of valid visas and green cards.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the new version also quickly ran afoul of the courts.\n\nIn Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson\u2019s 43-page ruling used the public statements of the president and his senior advisers to conclude that there was a \u201cstrong likelihood of success\u2019\u2019 that opponents of the travel ban would be able to prove it violates the Constitution.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits any \u201claw respecting an establishment of religion,\u201d meaning the government must remain neutral among religions \u2014 or between religions and nonreligion \u2014 and not favor or disfavor a particular faith.\n\n\u201cA reasonable, objective observer \u2014 enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance \u2014 would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nTrump, speaking at a rally in Nashville shortly after the judge\u2019s decision, insisted he would not back down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this terrible ruling,\u201d he said, to applause from the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe second version of the travel ban \u201cis a watered-down version of the first one,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd let me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has said it will continue to defend the president\u2019s order in court.\n\nIn the Maryland case, U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang wrote that the origins of the travel ban suggest that religious screening, not national security, was the primary purpose.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the White House took the highly irregular step of first introducing the travel ban without receiving the input and judgment of the relevant national security agencies strongly suggests that the religious purpose was primary, and the national security purpose, even if legitimate, is a secondary post hoc rationale,\u2019\u2019 the judge wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\n7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court\n\nTrump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet \u2014 and it\u2019s becoming a real problem", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-17", "type": "article"}
