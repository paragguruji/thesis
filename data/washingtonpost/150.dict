(Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nA federal judge in Alexandria, Va., pressed the government Friday to produce any evidence that a ban on travel from seven overwhelmingly Muslim countries was necessary on national security grounds.\n\nReferring to the California federal appeals court decision Thursday that maintained a freeze on President Trump\u2019s executive order, U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said that \u201cthe courts have been begging you to provide some evidence, and none has been forthcoming.\u201d\n\nThe presidential order, she said, \u201chas all kinds of defects\u201d and \u201cclearly is overreaching\u201d when it comes to long-term residents of the United States. The White House has issued guidance that those residents are exempt from the ban, but that language is not actually in the order.\n\nThe only evidence provided by the government in the Virginia challenge to the ban that she was considering, she noted, was the order itself.\n\nOn the other hand, Brinkema said, \u201cthere is some strong, colorful evidence that the motivations for this order may bump into the establishment clause of the First Amendment\u201d \u2014 a reference to freedom of religion.\n\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nShe said there was also \u201cstartling evidence\u201d from national security professionals that the order \u201cmay be counterproductive to its stated goal\u201d of keeping the nation safe.\n\nBrinkema cited a letter from a bipartisan group of former high-ranking officials who warned that the ban would aid the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda efforts, endanger troops abroad and damage counterterrorism relationships.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a scintilla of evidence from the respondents that counters this very powerful piece of evidence,\u201d Brinkema said. \u201cGive me the evidence.\u201d\n\n[Travel ban ruling: In court as on Twitter, Trump confronts evidence gap]\n\nVirginia is asking for a nationwide injunction against the ban similar to that issued in Washington state and upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring intervened in the case last week, arguing that Virginia will lose students and workers under the order.\n\nAs one example, the state\u2019s attorneys point to Najwa Elyazgi, a Libyan senior at George Mason University. After being stranded in Istanbul for a week and returning only under the Washington state court order, Elyazgi says she plans to attend graduate school in Canada.\n\nVirginia\u2019s solicitor general, Stuart Raphael, said that over a thousand college students and 66 faculty members in Virginia are affected by the ban.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t leave and know that they can come back,\u201d he said.\n\nErez Reuveni, senior litigation counsel from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation, argued that the state had no standing to challenge the ban. The original plaintiffs in the case, Tareq and Ammar Aziz, have dropped their suit after successfully entering the United States. So has plaintiff Sahar Kamal Ahmed Fadul, who came through Dulles on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cVirginia has a policy dispute with the president,\u201d Reuveni said. \u201cVirginia cannot place itself in removal hearings.\u201d\n\nWhile an individual affected by the ban might be able to bring a case against it, Reuveni argued that Brinkema could not review the rationale behind national security policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even understand how this trial would work,\u201d Reuveni said. \u201cCould President Trump be called to testify? \u2026 I don\u2019t think you want to go there.\u201d\n\nBrinkema challenged that assertion. While she acknowledged that the president has the right to bar people from coming into the United States if he finds \u201cthe entry of any aliens\u201d would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the country\u2019s interests, she said the finding must have some basis.\n\n\u201cThe word finding in the law doesn\u2019t just mean one thinks, one believes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe asked Reuveni if the president could deem all redheads a threat to the country and ban them.\n\n\u201cAre you saying a court could not look at that order and say, \u2018What is going on here?\u2019\u201d she asked.\n\nReuveni responded that the government, not the courts, make national security determinations. For a court to do so, he said, might be a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nBut he also argued that statements Trump made \u201cprior to taking the oath of office\u201d should not be used to evaluate his current actions.\n\nFormer national security professionals, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t know what\u2019s happened today, when the president does.\u201d\n\nOn the 9th Circuit\u2019s order, Reuveni said, \u201cWe may appeal, we may not.\u201d\n\nBrinkema did say she would have to evaluate how to handle the Virginia case in light of the 9th Circuit ruling. Raphael argued that the commonwealth is actually further along in challenging the ban than Washington state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a race,\u201d Brinkema said.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "type": "article"}
