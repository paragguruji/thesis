Kelly said at a news conference Tuesday that department officials \u201care and will remain in compliance with judicial orders,\u201d though attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union said they were not fully convinced that was the case.\n\n[Trump travel ban sows chaos at airports, outrage at protests]\n\nAs of 7 p.m., for example, the administration had not yet provided a list of those detained to ACLU lawyers, despite a New York federal judge\u2019s order that it do so, an ACLU lawyer there said. An ACLU lawyer in Los Angeles said the organization also has fielded reports that Customs and Border Protection agents are \u00adcoercing holders of valid visas or green cards to voluntarily relinquish their documents, and a lawsuit in Virginia alleges similar conduct.\n\nSenior Homeland Security officials on Tuesday sought to quell concerns about travelers being denied entry in violation of court orders, holding a news conference to discuss the details with reporters. Officials and civil rights lawyers said the situation on Tuesday was a far cry from over the weekend \u2014 when people with green cards and visas were being detained for hours on end, some of them ultimately flown out to other countries even as courts ordered that they should not be.\n\nBut civil liberties advocates said a lot of confusion remained over how the order \u2014 which temporarily bans refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from coming to the United States \u2014 should be legally implemented. Also with the president\u2019s firing of his acting attorney general over her refusal to defend the ban, they said they worried that the president was trying to run over normal checks on his authority.\n\nIn New York \u2014 where a federal judge ordered authorities nationwide to stop deporting or taking into custody those with valid immigrant and nonimmigrant visas \u2014 the ACLU said it was still pressing for a list of who had been detained. That list is important \u201cto confirm that people have not been sent back in defiance of the court\u2019s order, and whether people are still being detained or denied access to counsel,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of the list, we would be left to simply take the unilateral assurances of the administration, which we will not do,\u201d Gelernt said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, ACLU lawyers said they were still fielding reports of people who were being forced to endure hours-long processing, and sometimes coerced into signing away their legal rights to be in the United States. Jennie Pasquarella, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California, said one visa holder from Syria who had permanent resident status in Saudi Arabia was pressured into giving up his rights to be here, though he left with documentation saying he could remain for 18 days.\n\nShe said people were still being held up \u2014 though not for nearly as long as when the order first took effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely felt like, at least through Sunday, they were ignoring the order, but it does seem like they have changed what they\u2019re doing and not holding people in this prolonged manner,\u201d Pasquarella said.\n\nIn some cases, the damage appears to already be done. Yemeni brothers Tareq and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz, 21 and 19, for example, got into Dulles International Airport on Saturday morning. Their lawyers say they were then handcuffed and coerced, with no legal counsel present, into giving up the immigrant visas they had worked for years to secure. They were put on a plane to Addis Ababa, Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia, where they sat in the airport for three days without access to their passports, their lawyers said. On Tuesday, the brothers were sent to Djibouti, where for now they have been allowed to stay.\n\nSara Yarjani, 35, a master\u2019s student at the California Institute for Human Science, said she was similarly pressured into signing away her visa at the Los Angeles airport when officials told her she could either do so and leave on her own, or be forcibly removed from the United States and face the prospect of a one-to-five-year ban.\n\nYarjani, an Iranian national whose parents live in Austria, said she spent 23 hours in custody Friday into Saturday, learning just before she was put on a plane of a judge\u2019s order declaring that those like her should not be deported. She said she told Customs and Border Protection officers as much, and one simply responded \u201cWowzas\u201d before ultimately ushering her on board.\n\n\u201cIt was so terrible and heartbreaking,\u201d Yajani said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to find out what are the steps I can take.\u201d\n\nAttorneys general in four states have now moved to join the court battle over Trump\u2019s immigration order. The most immediate front appears to be what happens when people try to board U.S.-bound planes overseas.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates said this week that officials were preventing people from boarding those flights. Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan said that in the past 72 hours, 721 people with visas from the seven countries listed on the executive order had been denied permission at foreign airports to board flights headed to the United States, and asserted, \u201cThere were carriers that overinterpreted our guidance.\u201d\n\nThe federal court orders constrain the actions of government officials after people have landed in the United States but seem to have little practical value to someone waiting to board a U.S.-bound plane overseas.\n\nImmigrant rights attorneys said the government does not appear to be technically in violation of the court orders by advising airlines to turn away people before they have boarded planes heading to the United States, with the possible exception of people trying to fly to Boston\u2019s Logan Airport.\n\nSusan Church, one of the attorneys who brought the challenge there, said the judge\u2019s order specifically requires Customs and Border Protection officers to tell the airlines that people traveling to Boston will not be deported or detained.\n\n\u201cThe airlines, despite being notified, are claiming they don\u2019t know about this order,\u201d Church said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s really outrageous, and it\u2019s violating the court order.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials conceded at Tuesday\u2019s briefing that they had made mistakes and said that they would explore reports of people being coerced into signing away their documentation. Kelly said that a \u201csmall number\u201d of travelers were being held up for extra processing but that none were detained. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday issued written guidance designed to give airlines and travelers a clearer understanding of new rules.\n\nMcAleenan also said that officials would soon allow 872 refugees into the country and that officers processed 1,060 waivers for green-card holders.\n\nOfficials struggled to explain why the rollout of the order over the weekend was so chaotic. One individual familiar with the process said that leaders from Customs and Border Protection and the other DHS agencies were briefed on the order\u2019s details on Friday afternoon in a pair of urgent conference calls, including one after Trump signed it. A second individual said career operational staff and lawyers at Customs and Border Protection and Department of Homeland Security headquarters were not given an opportunity to review and comment on the order before it was signed.\n\nKelly disputed reports that he had not been aware of the order or consulted on it until the last minute. He said that he knew it was being written and saw \u201cat least two drafts\u201d before Friday, and that members of his legal team were involved.\n\nLori Aratani, Rachel Weiner, Michael Laris and Mark Berman contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/ellennakashimapost/", "type": "article"}
