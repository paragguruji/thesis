And we haven\u2019t had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted the order was within his executive powers and \u201ca bad high school student would understand this.\u201d The court said it would not issue a decision Wednesday but previously indicated a ruling could come this week.\n\nThe panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit on Tuesday aggressively questioned a Justice Department lawyer about what he considered the limits on the president\u2019s power and what evidence Trump relied upon in temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\n(Dalton Bennett,Ahmed Deeb/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the panel similarly interrogated Washington state\u2019s solicitor general, who is challenging the president\u2019s directive, over what evidence he had to demonstrate religious discrimination and whether a lower-court judge\u2019s freeze on the ban was too broad.\n\nThe court said it expects to make a decision on the matter \u201cprobably this week,\u201d and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland promised rapid consideration. The ruling could affect tens of thousands of travelers whose visas were revoked by the initial executive order, then restored after U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle put a nationwide stop to it.\n\nThe issue of whether the order is allowed to remain in place while legal challenges continue is likely to end up at the Supreme Court. But it will be harder for the Trump administration to prevail at the high court if the appeals court rules that a nationwide halt is warranted.\n\nThe broad legal question is whether Trump acted within his authority in blocking the entry of people from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Syria and Yemen, or whether his order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims. The judges must also weigh the harm the ban imposes and whether it is proper for them to intervene in a national security matter on which the president is viewed as the ultimate authority.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump added to his barrage of comments decrying the challenge to the order, and casting blame if the decision does not go his way. \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cPolitics!\u201d\n\nLater, before his address to the police chiefs and sheriffs, Trump appeared to describe the legal challenges as \u201chorrible, dangerous and wrong.\u201d\n\nJustice Department lawyer August E. Flentje argued Tuesday that the order was \u201cwell within the president\u2019s power,\u201d asserting that Congress and a previous administration had designated the seven affected countries as having problems with terrorism \u2014 albeit in a different context.\n\nSome of the judges, though, seemed wary of that claim. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked Flentje if the government had \u201cpointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism.\u201d\n\nJudge Richard Clifton, a President George W. Bush appointee, noted that the government already had processes in place to screen people coming from those countries and asked, \u201cIs there any reason for us to think that there\u2019s a real risk or that circumstances have changed such that there\u2019s a real risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president determined that there was a real risk,\u201d Flentje responded.\n\nWashington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that the government was essentially asking the court to \u201cabdicate\u201d its role as a check on the executive branch, and he asserted that reinstating the ban would \u201cthrow the country back into chaos.\u201d\n\nBut Purcell, too, faced critical questions. Clifton said that he was having \u201ctrouble understanding why we\u2019re supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected\u201d \u2014 a key point, as the state is trying to demonstrate that Trump\u2019s order is intentionally discriminatory and runs afoul of the Constitution.\n\nPurcell pointed to public statements from Trump and his allies. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for example, recently said: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said: \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFlentje disputed that the order is a Muslim ban, and he said the judges should limit their consideration to the executive order itself.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary to enjoin the president\u2019s national security determination based on some newspaper articles, and that\u2019s what has happened here,\u201d he said.\n\n[Federal appeals court decides to schedule a hearing on Trump travel order]\n\nWhichever side loses is sure to take the fight to the Supreme Court. That traditionally has been solid ground for presidents. Justices often defer to a president on matters of immigration and national security, because of his constitutional powers and an additional grant of authority from Congress.\n\nThe politically divisive fight comes as the Supreme Court remains shorthanded following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago; the four Democratic-appointed liberals and four Republican-appointed conservatives often split.\n\nTrump said at a White House event Tuesday that he was prepared to elevate the dispute as needed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take it through the system,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the country \u2026 We\u2019ll see what happens. We have a big court case. We\u2019re well represented.\u201d\n\nFlentje did offer something of a compromise for the judges Tuesday, saying they could limit the lower-court judge\u2019s ruling to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future.\n\nPurcell countered that officials had not explained how they would practically implement such an order.\n\nIn addition to Clifton and Friedland, the case was heard by William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. The hearing was conducted via telephone, with Friedland listening from San Jose, Canby from Phoenix and Clifton from Hono\u00adlulu.\n\nIf those judges turn down the administration\u2019s appeal and the matter moves immediately to the Supreme Court, the argument would be only on the temporary restraining order, and it would require five justices to reverse the lower court\u2019s actions.\n\nThe high court faced a similar issue last term, when a Texas judge imposed a nationwide halt on an executive action from Obama that would have shielded more than 4 million immigrants who were in the country illegally, but who met certain requirements to get work permits. The justices then split 4 to 4 on the matter.\n\nIf five justices could not agree, the case would return to Robart, the district judge, to decide whether Trump\u2019s order should be permanently enjoined. The fight up the legal ladder would then begin anew \u2014 possibly taking months, past when the travel ban is set to expire.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly predicted Tuesday that the administration would prevail in its bid to reinstate the executive order and said judges might be considering the matter from an \u201cacademic,\u201d rather than a national security, perspective.\n\n\u201cOf course, in their courtrooms, they\u2019re protected by people like me,\u201d he said.\n\nTestifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Kelly forcefully defended the measure as a necessary \u201cpause\u201d so officials could improve vetting procedures. He said that it is \u201centirely possible\u201d that dangerous people are now entering the country with the order on hold \u2014 as Trump has said via Twitter \u2014 and that officials might not know about them until it is too late.\n\n\u201cNot until the boom,\u201d he said when asked if he could provide evidence of a dangerous person coming into the country since the ban was suspended.\n\n[Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented]\n\nKelly\u2019s view does not reflect the consensus of the national security community. Ten high-ranking diplomatic and security officials \u2014 among them former secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former CIA director Leon E. Panetta, and former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael V. Hayden \u2014 said in a legal filing that there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries.\n\nKelly also acknowledged Tuesday that if he were given a second chance, he might do things differently in rolling out the order. That stands somewhat in contrast to Trump\u2019s recent assertion to Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly that the implementation was \u201cvery smooth,\u201d and it is important because \u2014 if the appeals court reinstates the ban \u2014 Kelly might get another crack at implementation.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, I should have \u2014 this is all on me, by the way \u2014 I should have delayed it just a bit, so that I could talk to members of Congress, particularly the leadership of committees like this, to prepare them for what was coming, although I think most people would agree that this has been a topic of President Trump certainly during his campaign and during the transition process,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nHe later said, though, that most of the confusion that followed the signing of the order was attributable to court orders and occurred not among Customs and Border Protection officers but among protesters in airports. After people were initially detained and deported, demonstrators packed airports to voice their displeasure, and civil liberties and immigration lawyers filed lawsuits across the country.\n\nMany of those suits are ongoing, with lawyers keeping a close eye on the proceedings at the 9th Circuit. On Tuesday, a group of lawyers asked a federal judge in New York to force the government to turn over a list of those who had been detained or deported, as the court had previously ordered officials to do. The government has said no one is being detained and has debated what information it is required to provide.\n\n\u201cNoncompliance of a court order is very serious, especially where people\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cWe filed this motion to enforce because the government left us no choice.\u201d\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "type": "article"}
