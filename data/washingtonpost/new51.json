The Supreme Court said that President Trump\u2019s ban on U.S. entry by citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can be enforced if those visitors lack a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d (Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration got some of what it wanted when the Supreme Court decided to allow a scaled-back version of the president\u2019s travel ban to take effect.\n\nBut the court\u2019s ruling also put pressure on officials to press ahead with their review of the information other countries are able to gather on potential U.S.-bound travelers \u2014 which might ultimately produce more rigorous vetting procedures or a completely new ban.\n\nThe U.S. already has stepped up vetting of foreigners, having consular officers around the world ask visa applicants for their social media handles and requiring applicants to list 15 years of travel history, including the source of funding for their trips. Trump\u2019s travel ban, though, contemplates even more-restrictive measures, and the president himself has, counter to the representation of Justice Department lawyers, suggested that the measure is not a mere \u201cpause\u201d for assessment.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter this month.\n\n[What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel-ban ruling means]\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision Monday means that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the administration can decline to issue visas to residents of six majority-Muslim countries, provided that those seeking the visas \u201clack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d That means those from the six countries who have family members in the United States, job offers or school acceptance letters should be able to get in, although others without such ties should not.\n\nThe court said the same standard should be applied to refugees who also would have been blocked under Trump\u2019s ban.\n\nTrump indicated in a recent memo that he would begin enforcing his ban 72 hours after \u201call applicable injunctions are lifted or stayed.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump called the ruling \u201ca clear victory for our national security\u201d and said it \u201callows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation\u2019s homeland.\u201d State, Justice Department and Homeland Security officials have said they are still reviewing and discussing the decision to see how it should be implemented, and a Justice Department official said lawyers were readying for more possible legal challenges on the question of who had a \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. tie.\n\n[Trump said dangerous people might be pouring in without his travel ban. But he\u2019s not rushing to restore it.]\n\nThe court\u2019s decision did not offer finality. Although the justices partially lifted lower courts\u2019 injunctions on Trump\u2019s ban, they said they would take up the case fully in their October term. The ban on entry to the United States was supposed to have been temporary: 90 days for citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria, and 120 days for refugees. By the time the court hears the case, the landscape almost certainly will have shifted.\n\nWithin 20 days of the ban\u2019s taking effect, the secretary of homeland security is supposed to submit to Trump a report on the information needed from countries to adjudicate applications for entry to the United States, and a list of which countries do not provide such information. The countries on the list are then supposed to be given 50 days to begin providing the required information.\n\nIf they do not, they could be included in a proclamation that would block \u201cappropriate categories\u201d of their citizens from coming to the United States, according to the executive order.\n\nJonathan Meyer, who was a deputy general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama and now works in private practice at the Sheppard Mullin law firm, said the Trump administration could make the argument that \u201cthey still can\u2019t do [the review] because all of the injunctions haven\u2019t been lifted,\u201d but he expected that the administration would press ahead.\n\nThe Supreme Court wrote: \u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments\u201d within 90 days.\n\nThe conclusion of that review could mean increased vetting: for example, not just asking travelers for their social media profiles, but also their passwords or other data, Meyer said. And the executive order, he said, contemplated \u201csome sort of longer-lasting ban or partial ban\u201d on nationals from countries that could not provide the requested information.\n\nSome of the countries on the list are experiencing military conflicts \u2014 which would probably make providing the requested data difficult.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman did not provide comment.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has suggested \u2014 and the Supreme Court said it would consider \u2014 whether the case became moot on June 14. That is 90 days from when Trump signed his revised entry ban. The Justice Department had in the past argued that officials felt barred by a Hawaii judge\u2019s injunction from doing the reviews.\n\n\u201cWe have put our pens down,\u201d acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in May, adding that the administration had \u201cdone nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u201d A different federal appeals court would later clarify that the administration could go ahead with its review work.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-27", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "courts", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "vetting", "court", "united", "trumps", "whats", "procedures", "countries", "states", "department", "administration"], "summary": "\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter this month.\nThe court said the same standard should be applied to refugees who also would have been blocked under Trump\u2019s ban.\nAlthough the justices partially lifted lower courts\u2019 injunctions on Trump\u2019s ban, they said they would take up the case fully in their October term.\nAnd the executive order, he said, contemplated \u201csome sort of longer-lasting ban or partial ban\u201d on nationals from countries that could not provide the requested information.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has suggested \u2014 and the Supreme Court said it would consider \u2014 whether the case became moot on June 14."}
