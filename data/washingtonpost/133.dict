(Caren Firouz/Reuters)\n\nTo U.S. and international officials, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed is a terrorist who orchestrated a bloody urban siege that killed 166 people in India in 2008. But to his many devout followers in Pakistan, he is a champion of Islamic values and Kashmiri independence from India.\n\nTo U.S. and international officials, Shakil Afridi is a courageous man who helped the United States track down and kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. But to many Pakistanis, he is a traitor who sold his services to a Western adversary of Islam and should remain in prison.\n\nTherein lies the conundrum facing Pakistani officials today as they scramble to forestall punitive actions by the Trump administration \u2014 and ease pressure from other foreign partners, including China \u2014 without provoking turmoil at home, especially among Muslim militants the state has long coddled as proxies against India.\n\nSuddenly confronted with a U.S. president who has declared war against Islamist extremism and has expressed little interest in the long history of political accommodation and security alliances between Washington and Islamabad, officials here are struggling to find a middle ground that may no longer exist.\n\nThe disarray was evident in clashing public statements by two government officials concerning the draconian travel ban imposed by Trump last week on all visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nWhite House aides suggested last week that ban might be expanded to include Pakistan and other countries with terrorist links. On Saturday, Pakistani media outlets quoted a White House spokesman telling the BBC that there are \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to add Pakistan, Afghanistan or Lebanon, but warning that this could change if the countries stop complying with U.S. requests for information.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria, addressing a news conference Thursday, noted deferentially that \u201cit is every country\u2019s sovereign right to decide its immigration policy.\u201d He said Pakistan looks forward to continuing its \u201clong-standing and cooperative relations\u201d with Washington.\n\nBut Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar, speaking at a seminar, declared bluntly that \u201cno solution from America and the West can be imposed on our region\u201d and that the West should stop \u201cblaming Islam\u201d for the world\u2019s ills. \u201cThe tendency to label every man with a beard and every woman wearing hijab as a potential terrorist should cease now,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the past week, Pakistan has taken steps to tighten legal nooses around both Saeed and Afridi, confining the firebrand cleric to house arrest and denying travel documents to the imprisoned doctor\u2019s family. Taken together, these moves send a double message: The government is serious about reining in a high-profile Islamist militant with a U.S. bounty for his arrest, but it is also serious about keeping an alleged traitor \u2014 whom Trump once vowed to set free \u2014 behind bars and under wraps.\n\nThe crackdown on Saeed and his group, which has been allowed to function freely for the most part, is seen by many here as a hasty conciliatory gesture to the new administration in Washington. But Pakistani officials insist it was the product of long internal deliberation \u2014 and further proof of a permanent shift from official tolerance for extremists who once served as Pakistan\u2019s deniable agents in India and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cPakistan is not merely an aspirant for cooperation with Washington, it is a serious and credible partner,\u201d Tariq Fatemi, a senior aide to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said in an interview Friday. He said Sharif\u2019s government, with strong support from the army, is determined to clear the country of all militants. \u201cWe will kill them or drive them out,\u201d he said. \u201cAny willingness to look the other way is no longer there.\u201d\n\nSome analysts said that while Pakistan is concerned about the Trump administration expanding its travel ban or cutting off aid, it also faces other sources of pressure to clamp down on extremists. One is China, Pakistan\u2019s giant neighbor and major economic partner, which does not want its investments \u2014 especially the planned $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC \u2014 threatened by violence.\n\nThe other is an intergovernmental watchdog agency, the Financial Action Task Force, which monitors money laundering and terrorist financing. The group, which can blacklist countries that don\u2019t have enough safeguards in place, has reportedly raised new alarms about \u201cgray payments,\u201d or money being funneled as charitable donations to or from militant groups in Pakistan, including Saeed\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculation about what Trump might do, but I think we are seeing a confluence of other factors,\u201d said Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. \u201cThe financial issues are the most urgent. The CPEC has injected a lot of hope and optimism into the country, and everyone wants to make sure it succeeds.\u201d\n\nSome commentators say that to prove it is serious about curbing Islamist extremism, the government must stop sending mixed signals to groups like Saeed\u2019s as well as to hard-line sectarian movements, which are often banned but then allowed to regroup under new names. Saeed once headed a militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, that was accused by India of staging the Mumbai siege. Now he heads two other groups that claim to be charitable and educational, but are also fiercely anti-India.\n\nFatemi said that the government also intends to counter extremist ideas with persuasion, registering radical seminaries and \u201cbringing them into the mainstream\u201d through a National Action Plan established by Sharif. \u201cWe are going to bring about a major shift in the thinking process of people on the fringes,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that message is not so easy to spread in an impoverished country of 180 million people, about 80 percent of them Muslims. Today, more than 2 million youths are studying in seminaries, and groups like Saeed\u2019s enjoy wide popularity. The cause of Kashmiri oppression has been a national rallying cry for decades, and many Pakistanis have been taught to believe that India, Israel and the United States are mortal enemies of Islam.\n\nAmong the few Pakistanis who express hope for sympathy from the Trump administration are the relatives of Afridi, who has been in prison for six years on charges of abetting Islamist militants. His family says it believes the real reason was his role in locating bin Laden, by conducting a medical survey in the city where the al-Qaeda leader was found and killed by U.S. Navy Seals.\n\nThis week, relatives and attorneys for Afridi said the government had refused to renew identity documents for his family members and had placed their names on a list of Pakistanis who are banned from leaving the country. In an interview, his younger brother, Jamil Afridi, 55, said he hoped the Trump administration would come to the doctor\u2019s aid.\n\n\u201cMy brother did nothing wrong. He was a true American hero who helped the United States eliminate the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist,\u201d Afridi said. \u201cI congratulate President Trump and I am optimistic about him, because he said he would help free my brother once he was elected to office. He is a man of action who does what he says.\u201d\n\nHaq Nawaz Khan in Peshawar contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nPakistani cleric arrested to appease Trump administration, India, supporters say\n\nIn Pakistan, five girls were killed for having fun.
