But Trump, taking the stage barely an hour later at a rally Wednesday night in Nashville, let loose on the \u201cterrible ruling\u201d \u2014 and doubled down on the sentiments that got the policy into trouble in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe order blocked was a \u00adwatered-down version of the first order,\u201d Trump thundered, adding later: \u201cLet me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way.\u201d\n\nThe episode was just one of numerous examples of Trump and his advisers pushing incendiary language and unfounded claims, even in the face of opposition from federal judges and top lawmakers of both parties.\n\nOn Thursday \u2014 for the 12th day in a row \u2014 the White House defended Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that his predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered wiretaps of Trump\u2019s New York City offices during the presidential campaign, despite a growing chorus of declarations from intelligence officials and members of Congress that nothing of the sort happened.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d the Democratic and Republican chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Thursday in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe stands by it,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of Trump\u2019s original claim.\n\n[Federal judge halts Trump travel ban hours before it was to take effect]\n\nTrump boosters say his freewheeling rhetoric, in person and on social media, is a large part of his appeal and has kept him in good stead with his political base. But it is also making governing more challenging.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has pledged that he would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d at a lower cost, setting an impossible standard for congressional Republicans as they seek to craft a bill to scale back Obama\u2019s signature health-care law.\n\nTrump has sent conflicting signals on whether he supports a \u201cborder adjustment tax,\u201d a key component of efforts to reduce taxes that has divided Republicans in the House and Senate who are eager for Trump\u2019s guidance.\n\nThe president\u2019s repeated pronouncements of admiration for Russian leader Vladi\u00admir Putin have forced his ambassador to the United Nations and his secretary of state to reassure allies by talking tougher about an adversary blamed for meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. election.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s allegations on Twitter \u2014 without citing any evidence \u2014 that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower last year has eaten up investigative resources in Congress and chipped away at his credibility among GOP leaders key to advancing the president\u2019s ambitious agenda.\n\nBut perhaps nowhere have Trump\u2019s words been as damaging as his attempts to implement the travel ban \u2014 which may have been damaged further by Trump\u2019s remarks at his Nashville rally. Trump inflamed controversy during the campaign by calling for a temporary ban on all foreign Muslims from entering the United States, then later shifted to vague pledges to ban people from countries with a history of Islamist terrorism.\n\n\u201cI am sure that challengers will use the president\u2019s comments last night as further evidence that the true intent of his executive order is to bar Muslim immigration,\u201d said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School.\n\n[Trump \u2018stands by\u2019 unproven allegation that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump Tower]\n\nIn rulings halting both the first and second attempts at a ban, judges have cited comments by Trump and his close advisers as evidence of the administration\u2019s intent to target Muslims in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution \u2014 even as lawyers for Trump insist that is not the case.\n\nThe somewhat narrower version of the ban put on hold Wednesday would have temporarily barred the issuance of new visas to citizens of six \u00adMuslim-majority countries and suspended the admission of new refugees. Early Thursday, a federal judge in Maryland issued a second injunction against the measure, suspending only the portion that stopped the issuance of visas.\n\nWhile some legal experts say Trump still has a strong chance of prevailing at the Supreme Court, based on arguments about executive powers, others have questioned whether comments coming from his administration have made it impossible to credibly argue that the ban is secular in nature.\n\nMo Elleithee, executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University, said Trump and his advisers \u201cseem to be validating the court\u2019s concerns every chance they get.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey seem not to know when they need to keep their mouths shut,\u201d said Elleithee, who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThe proposed policy can be traced back to December 2015, when Trump \u2014 reading in dramatic fashion at a campaign rally \u2014 called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d The statement is still available on Trump\u2019s campaign website.\n\nLater in the campaign, amid continuing uproar, Trump began referring to the ban as being aimed at particular nations rather than a religious group. But at times he also disputed the idea that the proposal had changed or narrowed.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rollback,\u201d Trump said in July 2016. \u201cIn fact, you could say it\u2019s an expansion. I\u2019m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim.\u2019 . . . And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d\n\nAlso undermining the administration\u2019s claim of secular intent was Trump\u2019s statement on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Jan. 27 \u2014 just before the first ban went into place \u2014 that he saw persecuted Christians as a priority in accepting refugees.\n\nAnd when he actually signed the measure, Trump declared: \u201cThis is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d He did not explain further.\n\nThe next day, a close Trump adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared on Fox News and seemed to offer an explanation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn his blistering 43-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii referred to those comments as well as a recent Fox News appearance by Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who said the second attempt at a ban would have \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d and that Americans would see \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d\n\nAt Wednesday night\u2019s rally in Nashville, Trump took aim at Watson and suggested there was little difference between the intent of his first executive order and his second.\n\n\u201cThe order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDuring a news briefing Thursday, Spicer said the administration had \u201ctailored\u201d the second order to address concerns raised about the first and said he was confident the president would ultimately prevail. Spicer said comments made by Trump and his aides, including those on Twitter, were \u201cnon-germane\u201d and \u201cnot in keeping with how [judges] are supposed to interpret the law.\u201d\n\nLeon Fresco, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said anything the president or those in his administration say now will likely become part of the ongoing litigation. The strongest evidence the challengers have to prove Trump intended the ban to disfavor Muslims, rather than protect national security, comes from the president\u2019s own words and those of his close advisers, he said.\n\nBut Fresco said it is possible Trump would ultimately prevail at the Supreme Court. In particular, he said, the judge in Hawaii had not addressed head-on whether Trump and his advisers\u2019 comments \u201cirrevocably stain the ability to ever issue an order like this, period.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that the comments by Trump and his advisers should not be considered because, in the department\u2019s view, the courts should not look beyond official statements and the order itself to determine its purpose.\n\nTimothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said Trump had an opportunity after he was elected to set a different course but has not.\n\n\u201cAs president, he should have said he was wrong to advocate for a Muslim ban,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cHe\u2019s never done that. What it appears he\u2019s doing now is trying to do it in a way that squeaks by.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
