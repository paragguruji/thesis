A copy of the draft order was leaked Wednesday to civil rights groups and obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI feel devastated,\u201d said Ibrahim Abu Ghanem, 37, a father of three in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, whose father and two brothers live in the United States. \u201cThis means all my plans are going to go down the drain.\u201d\n\nIf the order is enacted, among those immediately affected would be potential immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim countries \u2014 Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Libya and Sudan \u2014 that are considered by the Trump administration to be nations whose citizens \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d For the next 30 days, they will not be allowed entry into the United States, even if they have visas and relatives who are U.S. citizens.\n\n[The Islamic State wanted the West to fear refugees and Muslims. It worked.]\n\n(Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\nThe order also calls for halting all admissions and resettlement of refugees for 120 days pending the review of vetting procedures. For Syrian refugees, the ban will remain in place until further notice.\n\nOnce restarted, annual refugee admissions from all nations would be halved, from a current level of 100,000 to 50,000.\n\nFor those affected, the fear is that the order will be a harbinger of even greater restrictions for Muslim immigrants, refugees and visitors \u2014 fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign promises of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of foreigners seeking entry into the United States and installing \u201ca Muslim ban.\u201d Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran are among the leading countries of origin of recent refugees to the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be devastating,\u201d said Denise Bell, senior campaigner for refugee and migrant rights for watchdog group Amnesty International. \u201cRefugees are not a threat. They are the ones fleeing horrific violence. They are trying to rebuild their lives. They want the same safety and opportunities that any of us would want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so we are scapegoating them in the guise of national security,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, we are betraying our own values. We are violating international law.\u201d\n\nAs news of the impending order spread, lives were quickly affected across the world, particularly among the citizens of the countries immediately targeted. For them, it is already difficult to get visas or immigrate to the United States. Vetting has been stringent since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, rights activists say. Even so, many potential Muslim immigrants went through long screening processes, often lasting years, to gain entry to the United States. Now, many find themselves in an emotional and bureaucratic limbo.\n\n[Trump\u2019s intervention into policing, voting and immigration sets up showdown with America\u2019s largest cities]\n\n(Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Sanaa, Ghanem had been making plans to travel with his family to Cairo to apply for visas at the U.S. Embassy in the Egyptian capital. His mother and younger brother are also in Yemen. He wanted to reunite his family.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have spent countless nights dreaming of a better future for us and especially our children,\u201d said Ghanem, a former administrator at a center for battling cancer. \u201cWe were hoping for a better life, better opportunities and good education for our children.\u201d\n\nThe shock for Syrian refugees already in the United States cut deepest for those awaiting the arrival of loved ones.\n\nFor Eman, a widow in Chicago who asked that her surname be withheld out of concern for relatives back home, that means her son. They fled the western Syrian city of Homs in 2012, fearing he would be conscripted into President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s military. Months after her arrival in America, Eman had expected her eldest son to arrive in short order, once paperwork for his new marriage was approved.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like everything was fine, and he was finally going to join me here. Now they tell me it might be impossible because of the president\u2019s new decree,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so scared. I came to America because I thought it would be best for my family.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s bitter war has created the largest refugee crisis since World War II. Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon have absorbed more than 4 million displaced Syrians, spread across camps or living on meager resources in cramped apartments.\n\nIn comparison, the United States accepted fewer than 13,000 Syrian immigrants last year, a figure that rose only in the final months after tight vetting procedures initially stemmed the monthly flow to the low hundreds.\n\n[Why Trump can\u2019t simply build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border with an executive order]\n\n\u201cWe have to remember these people are escaping the very same terrorism that Trump says he\u2019s banning them for,\u201d said Suzanne Akhras Sahloul, founder of the Syrian Community Network, a grass-roots initiative that has stepped in to fill the linguistic and cultural gaps that larger relief agencies are unable to address.\n\nRefugee advocates say the resettlement of Syrians presents challenges unusual in the United States, even among new refugees. Doctors in Chicago discovered some Syrians still carried shrapnel in their bodies. Less visible but more pervasive is the trauma. Many have been tortured or lived amid constant bombardment.\n\nIn Iraq, where Iraqi military personnel are fighting against the Islamic State alongside U.S. Special Operations forces, the visa ban was considered an insult.\n\n\u201cThey trained me to fight terrorism, and they look at me as a terrorist?\u201d said one F-16 pilot who trained in the United States for five years. He declined to be named because he did not have his superiors\u2019 permission to speak to reporters. \u201cIt's true that they have the right to protect their country, but that doesn't mean they should treat us like we are germs.\u201d\n\nHe said he has no desire to live in the United States, but that he would like to visit again and \u201crelax\u201d after \u201cfighting terrorism on their behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they really do ban us, it means we are of no value to them,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are just using us.\u201d\n\nAmmar Karim, 37, an Iraqi correspondent with Agence France-Presse, is in the final steps of a program to resettle in the United States. He applied four years ago, and his sponsor in Seattle was recently told to prepare for his arrival. Karim was one of the first interpreters to work with U.S. Marines in Baghdad following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. He has also worked for large American news organizations, making him a target of militants.\n\n[Video: Syrian refugees to Trump: We are not terrorists]\n\nOn Thursday, Karim did not hide his disappointment and anger. \u201cNow, because of this new decision, I feel there is no hope that I will move to the U.S. \u201cI will have to stay in this country that is still not at peace. The people who will be affected by this ban are those who did the best for America in Iraq. They sacrificed their lives.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. This president doesn\u2019t understand our situation. The U.S. is abandoning the people who stood behind them.\u201d\n\nFor Iran and Iranian Americans, the new restrictions are expected to hit particularly hard. Of the roughly 1 million Iranian Americans living in the United States, the vast majority have family members in Iran. Those relatives, who fall under the new executive order banning citizens from certain countries, would be prohibited from visiting loved ones in the United States. Students, artists, filmmakers and even Europeans who also hold Iranian passports could be denied entry.\n\nUnder the executive order, governments are required to provide U.S. agencies with information confirming that any applicants are not a security threat. But because the United States and Iran do not have diplomatic ties \u2014 and have a history of tense relations \u2014 Iranian officials are unlikely to comply.\n\nEven if they did, \u201cwe are skeptical \u2026 the Trump administration would accept such efforts,\u201d NIAC Action, the sister organization of the National Iranian American Council, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis would, in effect, mean a permanent ban on entry for Iranians,\u201d the advocacy group said, adding that even Iranian green-card holders currently outside the United States could be barred from reentry.\n\n[Where the refugees in your state came from in 2015]\n\nIn the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, called Dadaab, near the \u00adKenya-Somalia border, news of Trump\u2019s impending announcement spread quickly.\n\n\u201cYou could see the sadness on people\u2019s faces,\u201d said Mohammed Rashid, an English teacher who has been waiting for five years for his asylum case to be approved.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2015, the United States admitted more than 90,000 Somali refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Many of them came from Dadaab, where generations of Somalis first fled civil war and then fled Islamic extremist groups, often applying for asylum in the United States after arriving at the camp.\n\nRashid fled Somalia for Dadaab in 1992 to save his family from the country\u2019s civil war. \u201cWe thought our children would have better lives in the U.S.,\u201d said Rashid. \u201cNow, with Trump, we are disappointed. There is nowhere else for us to go.\u201dIn Sudan, some were surprised to see their country on the list of affected countries. Earlier this month, the Obama administration relaxed long-standing sanctions on the country, and it appeared that relations between the nations were warming. As part of the agreement to lift sanctions, Sudanese officials pledged to increase cooperation on combating terrorism. Ghanem said he believes that the attitude toward Muslim immigrants and visitors will only worsen in the United States and that he is afraid his family will never be reunited.\n\nRashid sat for an interview with American resettlement officials in Kenya in 2015. His fingerprints were taken, but while waiting for his asylum to be approved, he and his wife had a third child, which he said delayed their approval.\n\nAfter the election, he started following several Trump-related accounts on Twitter to keep abreast of American news. His brother was resettled in Seattle several years earlier, and Rashid already felt an attachment to the United States. In November, when a Somali-born student at Ohio State University injured 11 people in an attack, Rashid read Trump\u2019s tweet that the attacker was a \u201cSomali refugee who should not have been in our country.\u201d\n\n[A charity set up by Anne Frank\u2019s father has become a fierce critic of Trump\u2019s plans for refugees]\n\nOn Wednesday, Rashid saw a tweet that said Somali refugees would be banned from the United States. He said he tried not to cry. \u201cThe refugees are people who ran away; they are victims,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we are being targeted.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, the United States accepted more than 4,000 \u201cLost Boys\u201d from Sudan, whose families were killed or vanished during the country\u2019s civil war. Their stories were broadcast in dozens of books, movies and television reports. Some of them went on to careers as professional athletes, diplomats and renowned writers.\n\nThe United States later resettled a large number of refugees fleeing conflict in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region, where 3.3 million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.\n\nSome Sudanese refugees in Cairo have spent years in Egypt seeking resettlement to the United States and Europe. Now, there is even less hope.\n\n\u201cI have been trying for four years, but all is in vain,\u201d said Maher Ismail, 23, a university student. \u201cOur conditions here are dire. It is very difficult to get anywhere, the U.S. or any other place. I have applied for a lottery visa three months ago anyway, but I know how this is going to end up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision has really destroyed our dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know what I will say to my mother or how I would break the news for her.\u201d\n\nLoveluck reported from Beirut and Sieff from Nairobi.
