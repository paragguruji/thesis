(The Washington Post)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it would allow more than 800 refugees to enter the United States this week, an announcement that comes amid widespread anger and confusion following President Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration order.\n\nTrump\u2019s order temporarily bans citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and halts refugee resettlement for a 120-day period.\n\nHowever, officials said at a briefing Tuesday afternoon that they would allow 872 refugees into the country.\n\nThese refugees were ready to travel and would face \u201cundue hardship\u201d if not able to do so, Kevin K. McAleenan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said at a briefing Tuesday afternoon. They will be processed with waivers through the end of the week, he said.\n\n[Hundreds of lawyers descend on airports to offer free help after Trump\u2019s executive order]\n\nAccording to a Homeland Security Web page about the immigration order, the 872 refugees are \u201cconsidered to be in transit.\u201d In the order signed by Trump last week, the temporary suspension of refugee entry to the country allows an exception for refugees \u201calready in transit\u201d and who would face \u201cundue hardship\u201d if denied admission.\n\nThe immigration order has created chaos and uncertainty around the globe, stranding some people at airports, causing others to be detained and raising questions about its scope.\n\nGroups that work with refugees expressed grave concerns about what the entry bans would mean. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement that 800 refugees \u201cset to make America their new home \u2026 [found] themselves barred from traveling to the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cRefugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process,\u201d the U.N. refugee agency said in a statement. The agency estimated that 20,000 refugees who might have been resettled in the United States over the 120-day period would be affected by the ban.\n\nReuters first reported that federal officials planned to grant waivers to the 872 refugees.\n\n[Trump\u2019s refugee ban is a matter of life and death for some, including a 1-year-old with cancer]\n\nAt the same Tuesday briefing, Homeland Security Secretary John F.

Former president Barack Obama on Monday rejected the contention that the new order was similar to actions taken by his administration.\n\nKelly also said that DHS would comply with judicial orders regarding the travel ban, despite cases where lawyers were prevented from talking to detainees, directly contradicting a court order.\n\n\u201cWe would not ignore a court order,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nKelly said during the briefing that as far as officials knew, no Customs official \u201cknowingly\u201d violated a court order.\n\nThis story, posted at 12:58 p.m., has been updated.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTrump has fired the acting attorney general who ordered Justice Dept. not to defend president\u2019s travel ban\n\nJudge halts deportations as refugee ban causes worldwide furor", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "allowed", "ban", "security", "refugee", "order", "week", "872", "united", "states", "signed", "refugees", "administration"], "summary": "Trump\u2019s order temporarily bans citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and halts refugee resettlement for a 120-day period.\nHowever, officials said at a briefing Tuesday afternoon that they would allow 872 refugees into the country.\nThe agency estimated that 20,000 refugees who might have been resettled in the United States over the 120-day period would be affected by the ban.\nReuters first reported that federal officials planned to grant waivers to the 872 refugees.\nnot to defend president\u2019s travel banJudge halts deportations as refugee ban causes worldwide furor"}
