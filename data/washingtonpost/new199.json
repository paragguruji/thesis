So did the question of whether the administration would comply with orders from federal judges to temporarily halt the travel ban.\n\nRaucous protests erupted in airport terminals from coast to coast. Tens of thousands of people protested outside the gates of the White House, in Boston\u2019s Copley Square and in New York\u2019s Battery Park, with its views over the Statue of Liberty.\n\nScenes of relief, anxiety and sorrow played out around the globe.\n\nAt Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, a 70-year-old Iranian woman who recently received her green card was released after being detained overnight. In New York City, a graduate student contemplated whether he would quit his doctoral program to rejoin his wife in Iran after she was blocked from returning to the United States.\n\nAnd in Iraq, a man who had risked his life working on behalf of the U.S. government bleakly wondered about his future and that of his wife and three children. Visas in hand, the family was due to fly Monday to the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s stabbed me in the heart with a dagger,\u201d he said.\n\n[Scholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration]\n\nTrump issued a statement late Sunday afternoon that offered little clarity, even as he defended his executive order as necessary to protect the United States from terrorism.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cThis is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president reiterated that the country would resume issuing visas to all countries \u201conce we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.\u201d\n\nStill, barely 48 hours after Trump issued his order, confusion reigned over its reach and its implementation. Even as the president and other top advisers defended the ban, some Trump officials appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of the action: its impact on green-card holders, who are permanent legal residents of the United States.\n\n\u201cAs far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d contradicting what government officials had said only a day earlier.\n\n1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos from the scene of protest at New York\u2019s JFK airport against Trump\u2019s executive order halting refu\u00adgee admissions View Photos Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president, and some travelers were detained at U.S. airports.

Kelly was less definitive, suggesting that green-card holders\u2019 status would help them gain entry to the country but that they nonetheless would be subject to a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d review.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly\u2019s department indicated separately Sunday that it would continue to implement Trump\u2019s directive, even as it said it \u201cwill comply with judicial orders\u201d issued by federal judges over the weekend, blocking enforcement of the ban to varying degrees.\n\n\u201cProhibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cNo foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom.\n\nAs the legal questions surrounding the order remained unanswered Sunday, the uncertainty and resentment unleashed by the executive order he signed two days earlier showed few signs of waning.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, lawyers seeking to represent people who had been detained failed to get information from Customs and Border Protection officials despite repeated attempts.\n\nEven three Democratic members of Congress \u2014 Reps. Gerald E. Connolly and Don Beyer of Virginia and Jamie Raskin of Maryland \u2014 ran into similar roadblocks. Connolly pressed an airport police officer to get a Customs and Border Protection official to meet with the lawmakers to tell them how many people were detained and to see whether they had been able to communicate with their attorneys.\n\n\u201cAre people being detained?\u201d Connolly asked the officer. \u201cHow can you enforce the law if you\u2019re not enforcing a judge\u2019s order?\u201d\n\nConnolly soon was on the phone with a CBP congressional affairs official. He and the other members pressed for information on possible detainees, including those traveling on a flight from Turkey. No one on site from the agency would meet with them.\n\n\u201cThat is unacceptable. It is our understanding you are detaining people,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cOur understanding is you have not followed that [court] order.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s far-reaching action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who plan to assemble Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court in a show of solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump\u2019s travel ban. In addition, at least one House member said he plans to introduce legislation to overturn Trump\u2019s action by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.\n\nTrump also encountered growing opposition Sunday from lawmakers in his own party.\n\n\u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright.\n\nSens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) also spoke out against the action, saying in a joint statement that the government has a responsibility to defend its borders but must uphold \u201call that is decent and exceptional about our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d they said, adding, \u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Sunday afternoon, Trump was quick to criticize McCain and Graham as \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d And Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d He cautioned that the United States doesn\u2019t have a religious test for entry into the country, and he stopped short of saying that Trump\u2019s action amounted to a Muslim ban.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security noted that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained.\n\nFederal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump\u2019s action flooded courtrooms.\n\nA federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in California, Virginia, Seattle and Boston.\n\n[The tumultuous politics of U.S. immigration policy, from Roosevelt to Trump]\n\nTrump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigration and to impose what became known as his \u201cMuslim ban,\u2019\u2019 remained unbowed Sunday. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it.\n\nJust after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world \u2014 a horrible mess!\u201d\n\nLater in the morning, Trump tweeted, \u201cChristians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d\n\nMany Americans agreed with Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate Muslims,\u201d said Kelley Anne Finn of Manassas, Va., who was interviewed at Dulles airport Sunday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate anybody. He\u2019s trying to protect us.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials said Sunday that they think it is possible for the White House to both comply with a judge\u2019s order and continue enforcing Trump\u2019s executive action. Their thinking is that the court order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the court order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place.\n\nThe officials pointed out that while the order affects deportations, the travelers stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States.\n\nThat interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. As Sunday wore on, it became clear that the answers to those questions would have to wait until another day.\n\nThe protesters outside the White House pushed on, wielding poster boards with messages such as \u201cIslamophobia is un-American\u201d and \u201cDissent is patriotic,\u201d chanting \u201cNo justice! No peace!\u201d and singing renditions of \u201cThis Land is Your Land.\u201d\n\nAnd in airports from Baltimore to Bangor, from Dallas to Denver, shouts of \u201cLet them go!\u201d and \u201cLet them in!\u201d reverberated Sunday. In many cities, demonstrators invoked the same chant: \u201cNo hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here.\u201d\n\nPhilip Bump in New York, Daniel Gross in Boston, and Michael Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Jenna Johnson, Sarah Larimer, Michael Laris, Ellen Nakashima, Ed O\u2019Keefe, Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell, Elise Viebeck and David Weigel in Washington contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["executive", "protests", "amid", "trump", "legal", "ban", "defends", "united", "trumps", "states", "countries", "president", "action", "order", "muslim", "confusion"], "summary": "President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily prohibiting entry into the United States for migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries and refugees from around the world fueled confusion, angst and a wave of protests across the country Sunday.\nVisas in hand, the family was due to fly Monday to the United States.\n[Scholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration]Trump issued a statement late Sunday afternoon that offered little clarity, even as he defended his executive order as necessary to protect the United States from terrorism.\nPresident Trump signed an executive order that halted refugees and residents from certain predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.\nFederal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump\u2019s action flooded courtrooms."}
