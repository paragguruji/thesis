(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Vowing to fight for his frozen travel ban all the way to the Supreme Court, President Trump knows Neil Gorsuch may ultimately cast the deciding vote in his favor. Senate Republicans are rushing to confirm the judge by Easter so that he can break several 4-4 ties for conservatives before the end of the term, and this could be the biggest.\n\nGorsuch, who at 49 is the youngest nominee for the high court in a quarter century, would be pivotal in hundreds of cases over the next several decades that impact every single American. But the pending nature of the travel ban, combined with Trump\u2019s continuing attacks on judges, raise the already high stakes of his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which begins Monday.\n\nThe president and his surrogates promise Gorsuch will be as, or maybe more, conservative than the late Antonin Scalia. On the 10th Circuit in Denver, he has been a staunch critic of the regulatory state but perennially deferential to the commander-in-chief's prerogative on matters related to national security.\n\n-- As a high-ranking official in George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, Gorsuch was heavily involved in defending many of the president\u2019s most controversial post-9/11 policies. Robert Barnes and Ed O\u2019Keefe report that, by his own account, Gorsuch \u201chelped coordinate litigation efforts involving a number of national security matters,\u201d including opposing the rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees to sue in federal court and working to block the release of photos of prisoners abused by U.S. military personnel in Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison. \"He took an active role in developing talking points for the administration on detainees, including whether \u2018enhanced interrogation\u2019 works. \u2018Yes\u2019 is handwritten next to a typed question: \u2018Have the aggressive interrogation techniques employed by the Admin yielded any valuable intelligence?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe New York Times identifies some other notable emails Gorsuch sent while at DOJ that show how favorably inclined he is to executive power. Many more are classified or still have not been turned over for review. In Dec. 2005, Congress handed Bush a significant defeat by tightening legal restrictions against torture in a law called the Detainee Treatment Act. Soon afterward, Gorsuch emailed to a White House colleague in case he needed \u201ccheering up\u201d about the administration\u2019s setback. \u201cThe email from Judge Gorsuch \u2026 linked to articles about a less-noticed provision in the act that undercut the rights of Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees by barring courts from hearing their habeas corpus lawsuits,\u201d Charlie Savage wrote. \u201cThe administration\u2019s victory is not well known but its significance shouldn\u2019t be understated,\u201d wrote Judge Gorsuch, who had helped coordinate the Justice Department\u2019s work with Congress on the bill.\n\nAround that time, Gorsuch visited Guant\u00e1namo for a briefing and tour : \u201cAfterward, he wrote a note to the prison operation commander, offering a glowing review.\u201d\n\n: \u201cAfterward, he wrote a note to the prison operation commander, offering a glowing review.\u201d \u201cHe \u2026 helped draft \u2026 an op-ed published by USA Today, under his supervisor\u2019s byline, defending President Bush\u2019s warrantless surveillance program and his use of a signing statement to claim a right to bypass the Detainee Treatment Act\u2019s provision banning torture.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has attacked judges in deeply personal terms. His declaration that Indiana-born Gonzalo Curiel could not fairly adjudicate a fraud lawsuit against Trump University because his parents were born in Mexico is the most notorious example. Paul Ryan called it the textbook definition of racism.\n\nAlways looking for a scapegoat, the president has pretty explicitly laid the groundwork to blame the courts after the next terrorist attack on the homeland \u2013 just as he blamed the generals when a Navy SEAL died on an operation he authorized in Yemen.\n\nHe tweeted this last month after a federal judge in Washington State issued an injunction:\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nHis supporters listen to him closely and now echo Trump\u2019s messaging. Here\u2019s an example from a conservative site that has 100,000 Twitter followers:\n\nAll it will take is one Jihadi Nut Job to get into the country courtesy of the Judges blocking Trump\u2019s Travel Ban. #BloodOnTheirHands pic.twitter.com/P5HO818CYe \u2014 Red Nation Rising (@RedNationRising) March 15, 2017\n\nA documentary filmmaker, who wrote a book called \u201cGorilla Mindset,\u201d shared this with his 221,000 followers:\n\nThe next terrorist attack will be blamed on activist judges, deep state, and the media.

Who has worked to stop him? Exactly. \u2014 Mike Cernovich \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Cernovich) March 16, 2017\n\nLou Dobbs, who has a TV show on Fox Business, framed this week\u2019s rulings as part of a broader conspiracy by the \u201cdeep state\u201d in a post to his 1.2 million followers:\n\nJay Bybee after delivering a lecture to University of Utah law students in 2015. (Salt Lake Tribune via AP)\n\n-- Gorsuch has made clear that he\u2019s uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s personal attacks on judges, including the one in Washington State who blocked the first order. But vastly more meaningful than that is whether he will be independent when legal challenges to his patron\u2019s agenda wind up on the SCOTUS docket. If the first two months are any indication, that will happen a lot, and just because Gorsuch doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s methods or rhetoric doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t back him up on the substance every time.\n\nJay Bybee, who signed the so-called \u201cTorture Memos\u201d in 2002 that permitted \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques on detainees, now sits on the Ninth Circuit. In an opinion this week, he poignantly rebuked Trump: \u201cThe personal attacks on the distinguished district judge and our colleagues were out of bounds of civic and persuasive discourse \u2014 particularly when they came from the parties. It does no credit to the arguments of the parties to impugn the motives or the competence of the members of this court; ad hominem attacks are not a substitute for effective advocacy. Such personal attacks treat the court as though it were merely a political forum in which bargaining, compromise and even intimidation are acceptable principles. The courts of law must be more than that, or we are not governed by law at all.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: Bybee wrote that paragraph at the very end of a 29-page dissent that took Trump\u2019s side on all the underlying legal questions. Nothing would stop Gorsuch from doing the same.\n\n-- \u201cTrump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet \u2014 and it\u2019s becoming a real problem,\u201d John Wagner and Matt Zapotosky note. \u201cIn rulings halting both the first and second attempts at a ban, judges have cited comments by Trump and his close advisers as evidence of the administration\u2019s intent to target Muslims in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution \u2014 even as lawyers for Trump insist that is not the case. \u2026 Undermining the administration\u2019s claim of secular intent was Trump\u2019s statement on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Jan. 27 \u2014 just before the first ban went into place \u2014 that he saw persecuted Christians as a priority in accepting refugees. And when he actually signed the measure, Trump declared: \u2018This is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u2019 \u2026 The next day, a close Trump adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared on Fox News and seemed to offer an explanation. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u2019 Giuliani said. \u2018So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIn his blistering 43-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii referred to those comments as well as a recent Fox News appearance by Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who said the second attempt at a ban would have \u2018mostly minor technical differences\u2019 and that Americans would see \u2018the same basic policy outcome for the country.\u2019 At Wednesday night\u2019s rally in Nashville, Trump took aim at Watson and suggested there was little difference between the intent of his first executive order and his second. \u2018The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with,\u2019 Trump said.\u201d That too can and will be used against him in court.\n\n-- Perhaps someone should have Mirandized the president? Trump\u2019s words are being used against him not just in courts of law, but they are also complicating what might have been a slam dunk confirmation process for Gorsuch. The more the president attacks judges and makes unsubstantiated claims on Twitter about things like wiretapping, the harder it is for moderate Senate Democrats to justify defecting to their base. That, in turn, makes it harder for Mitch McConnell to get the 60 votes he needs to avoid a confrontation over the nuclear option.\n\n-- A disquieting trend: Some allies and strong supporters of the president are pleading with him to begin disregarding federal court orders. These populists are doing their best to encourage Trump\u2019s \u201cI-alone-can-fix-it\u201d strongman impulses.\n\nMike Huckabee, a two-term governor of Arkansas and the father of a high-ranking White House official, posted this after the administration's most recent legal setback:\n\nHoping @POTUS tells Hawaii judge what Andrew Jackson told overreaching court-\"I'll ignore it and let the court enforce their order.\" \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 15, 2017\n\nJackson almost certainly never actually said that quote, though it is often attributed to him, but he did indeed refuse to enforce an 1832 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation. His rejection of this ruling, praised by Huckabee, led directly to the Trail of Tears, in which at least four thousand Native Americans died.\n\nBreitbart News, separately, gave big play yesterday to a Q&A with an attorney named Robert Barnes, who said the president could \u201cgo full Andrew Jackson.\" \u201cAmerica\u2019s courts only have power as long as people respect and believe and have confidence in the independence and integrity of those courts,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAs that gets sacrificed, courts lose power, and we may return back to a time and place where someone like President Trump needs to go back to Andrew Jackson and invoke his tradition and legacy in order to challenge judicial usurpation of the safety and security of the country. At the current time, there\u2019s not a lot we can do without being willing to go full Andrew Jackson against the court system.\u201d (This Barnes has no relation to the WaPo Supreme Court correspondent by the same name.)\n\nThat Breitbart interview got tons of pick-up on social media. For example, this is a Trump supporter who has 300,000 Twitter followers:\n\nDO IT!\n\nPres Trump Could \u2018Go Full Andrew Jackson\u2019 and Ignore Interference from Activist Judges#MakeAmericaSafeAgainhttps://t.co/SE2UdmBrxZ pic.twitter.com/fyM4CMxkC6 \u2014 Linda Suhler, Ph.D. (@LindaSuhler) March 16, 2017\n\n-- All this sudden talk about Jackson \u2013 specifically an episode that happened two centuries ago \u2013 is no coincidence. Trump calls himself \u201ca big fan\u201d of Jackson, hung a portrait of him in the Oval Office and on Wednesday visited the late president\u2019s estate on what would have been his 250th birthday. Trump stood at the grave and raised his hand to salute Jackson as taps was played. He said it was \u201cinspirational\u201d and noted that he too was elected by opposing the \u201carrogant elites.\u201d \u201cThey say my election was most similar to his,\u201d Trump said. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, said the president\u2019s dark inaugural address about \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d was inspired by Jackson. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House,\u201d Bannon said.\n\nTrump pauses to look at a portrait of Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, Jackson's home, in Nashville. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\n\u201cBy accident or by design, Trump\u2019s visit to the Hermitage delighted white nationalists,\u201d Dana Milbank reports. \u201cThe Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, applauded as \u2018fitting\u2019 Trump\u2019s honoring of this \u2018white supremacist extremist,\u2019 as it calls Jackson. The group created a poster for supporters to display featuring a portrait of Jackson underneath a reference to a quote from Bannon: \u2018Like Andrew Jackson\u2019s populism, we\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement.\u2019 Beneath the Jackson portrait the poster says, with adorning swastikas, \u2018The new face of the Republican Party: DailyStormer.com.\u2019 \u2026 White nationalists are attempting to appropriate Jackson the way the tea party commandeered the \u2018Don\u2019t Tread on Me\u2019 flag, and they see Trump encouraging them. \u2018The fact that he put up a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office should\u2019ve sent a huge signal,\u2019 white nationalist James Edwards said on his radio show, \u2018Political Cesspool.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We are in serious need of some more trails of tears just about now,\u2019 Andrew Anglin wrote on the Daily Stormer. \u2018And it\u2019s look[ing] like Trump may well deliver in spades.\u2019\u201d\n\nMichael Gerson, a top speechwriter for George W. Bush, writes in his column today that Trump picked \u201ca deeply disturbing hero\u201d in Jackson: \u201cHe was the original, and prototypical, testostero-president. \u2026 He consistently pressed the boundaries of executive authority. Many of the Founders had been internally conflicted slaveholders. Jackson was not one for psychic struggle. \u2026 And much of Jackson\u2019s reputation depended on being a frontier Indian fighter. This was a president who once earned the Indian nickname \u2018Sharp Knife.\u2019 In a battle against the Red Stick Creeks, Jackson set about to \u2018exterminate them\u2019 (his words). Hundreds of fighters and civilians were killed trying to flee across the Tallapoosa River. By one account, \u2018the river ran red with blood.\u2019 \u2026 Jackson was also one of the nation\u2019s leading advocates of \u2018Indian removal,\u2019 which amounted to the ethnic cleansing of Creeks and Cherokee across the lower South\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy discuss this ancient history (which is not really so ancient to the Cherokee)? Because Trump, in visiting Jackson\u2019s Hermitage, has invited us,\u201d Gerson concludes. \u201cJackson was wrong \u2014 badly, culpably wrong \u2014 on the largest issue of his time: the dignity and value of people of color. There is no refuge in the argument that Jackson merely reflected the values of his time. Jackson\u2019s opponent in two elections, John Quincy Adams, viewed slavery as \u2018the great and foul stain upon the North American Union.\u2019 Henry Clay called Indian expulsion \u2018a foul and lasting stain upon the good faith, humanity and character of the nation.\u2019 And Jackson\u2019s reputation will always bear those indelible marks.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson stands with his Chief of Staff, Margaret Peterlin, and Gen.

(Lee Jin-man/Pool/Reuters)\n\n-- The Trump administration gave its strongest signal yet that it would consider taking military action against North Korea, with Rex Tillerson saying a few hours ago that \u201call options are on the table.\u201d \u201cCertainly we do not want for things to get to a military conflict, we\u2019re quite clear on that in our communications, but obviously if North Korea takes actions that threaten the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,\u201d the secretary of state said at a press conference in Seoul. \u201cIf they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table.\" He added that he hopes Pyongyang will respond to other pressures such as sanctions before military action becomes necessary.\n\n\u201cTillerson made the remarks after visiting the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas,\u201d Anna Fifield reports. \u201cThere, he came almost face to face with North Korean soldiers standing on the other side of the yellow line that marks the border. North Korea has said that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the United States\u2019 mainland, and has shown clear progress in its missile program in tests over the last year. Sanctions and diplomatic engagement have failed to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But American administrations have long considered military action unfeasible because North Korea has artillery lined up on Seoul, a city of more than 20 million people that lies just 30 miles south of the DMZ.\u201d\n\nSyrian civil defense volunteers, known as the White Helmets, dig through the rubble of a mosque following an alleged U.S. airstrike on a mosque in the village of Al-Jineh in Aleppo yesterday.

Reasons for the discrepancy in location were not immediately clear. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring network, described the attack as a \u2018massacre\u2019 and said the dead were mostly civilians. \u2026 Separately Friday, Syria and Israel traded competing claims over an apparent Israeli attack near the western city of Palmyra in the early hours of the morning.

The Huffington Post\u2019s Christopher Mathias reports: \u201cFrank Wuco \u2015 a former radio host and veteran Naval Intelligence officer \u2015 was hired on Jan. 20 as [Trump\u2019s] senior White House adviser for the Department of Homeland Security \u2026 In June 2016, Wuco was asked by Breitbart News about [Pulse nightclub shooter] Omar Mateen. \u2018There\u2019s nothing radical about him at all,\u2019 Wuco said. \u2018He is a Muslim who is following the strictures of Islam and its guidance and prescriptions for violence and warfare against unbelievers.\u2019 \u2026 Wuco has also taken a conspiratorial view of Muslims in Europe and North America, portraying them as \u2018hellbent\u2019 on taking over Western countries: \u2018The assertiveness of Muslim communities in Western nations is becoming so pronounced. \u2026 you don\u2019t even need ISIS in Sweden,\u2019 he said in another 2016 radio interview.\u201d\n\nMichael Flynn sits in the East Room. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nTHERE IS A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, now a registered foreign agent for Turkey, was paid nearly $68,000 by multiple Russia-related entities in 2015, a higher amount that was previously known. Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cThe records show that the bulk of the money, more than $45,000, came from the Russian government-backed television network RT, in connection to a December 2015 trip Flynn took to Moscow. Flynn has acknowledged that RT sponsored his trip. The [documents] show that Flynn was also paid $11,250 that year by the U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, and another $11,250 by a U.S. air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group, which is owned by a Russian businessman. The cyberfirm and the airline said the payments were made for speeches Flynn delivered in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe documents were released by ranking House Oversight Committee Democrat Elijah Cummings, who sent FBI director James Comey a letter asking whether the fees violated prohibitions on retired military officers accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments. Cummings also asked for the release of documents Flynn filed to get a security clearance for his White House job, to examine whether Flynn was candid in response to detailed questions about his contacts with foreign governments. \u201cI cannot recall any time in our nation\u2019s history when the President selected as his National Security Advisor someone who violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy,\u201d Cummings wrote.\n\nSean Spicer briefs the press. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAN ALTERNATIVE REALITY:\n\n-- Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr released a joint statement with ranking Democrat Mark Warner stating that they have not seen any evidence supporting Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims. \u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d they said categorically. Paul Ryan also said that he has \u201cnot seen any evidence that this has occurred.\u201d (Karoun Demirjian)\n\n-- But then Sean Spicer said during his press briefing that Trump stands by his unsubstantiated allegations against Obama. \u201cHe stands by it,\u201d Spicer said, adding that he believes the president will ultimately be \u201cvindicated.\u201d \"Spicer refused to say whether Trump was relying on classified information to base his claims, and pointed repeatedly to news articles and \u2018widespread, open source material,'\" Philip Rucker and Abby Phillip report. \"Spicer spent nearly 10 minutes reading a litany of news stories, including from conservative reporters and the New York Times, that discuss reports of inquiries into the president's campaign aides and Russian officials. (None) of the reports confirm that Trump Tower was wiretapped.\u201d\n\n-- Spicer also repeated a claim, swirling around in the fever swamps of the far right, that Obama used the British spy agency GCHQ \u2013 the NSA's counterpart -- to surveil Trump. This prompted a very rare statement from the agency last night: \u201cRecent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wire tapping' against the then President Elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\" Let that sink in: A top official of the United States government, on camera and from behind a podium at the White House, accused our closest ally of spying on the president at the request of his predecessor. He did this with no evidence.\n\n-- The Telegraph reports that the U.S. has formally apologized to Britain over Spcier's comment. The London paper says both Spicer and national security adviser H.R. McMaster have personally apologized. \"The apology came direct from them,\" a source told the paper.\n\n-- A Fox News poll finds that 66 percent of Americans think Congress should investigate Russian interference in the presidential election. About the same number also want lawmakers to probe possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Voter are split, 46-49, over whether Congress should further investigate Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims.\n\n-- \u201cTonight, we know the president of the United States has no facts,\u201d Anderson Cooper said on his show last night. \u201cNo facts to back up his startling allegation that the former president of the United States, President Obama, wiretapped him in Trump Tower during the campaign.\"\n\nCopies of Trump's budget blueprint priorities for Fiscal Year 2018. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\nTRUMP'S BUDGET LANDS WITH A THUD IN THE CAPITOL:\n\n-- \"Some of Trump\u2019s top Congressional allies sharply criticized his first budget, pushing back on the proposed Pentagon funding hike as 'insufficient,' and slamming other proposed cuts to federal agencies and programs,\" Kelsey Snell and Karoun Demirjian report: \u201cCapitol Hill Republicans, however, did not seem terribly worried about the prospect of such a budget being enacted, stating matter-of-factly that it is Congress, after all, that controls the purse strings. \u2018Presidents propose, Congress disposes,\u2019 said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) the former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u2018We\u2019ve not had our chance yet.\u2019 Rogers was one of several GOP lawmakers to dismiss Trump\u2019s budget as a pie-in-the sky wishlist with little hope of surviving negotiations in Congress. Most Republicans gave passing support to Trump\u2019s general goal of increasing defense spending while reducing costs elsewhere in the budget. But none would embrace the specific White House blueprint.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cIf you\u2019re a poor person in America, President Trump\u2019s budget proposal is not for you,\u201d Steven Mufson and Tracy Jan write. \u201cTrump has unveiled a budget that would slash or abolish programs that have provided low-income Americans with help on virtually all fronts, including affordable housing, banking, weatherizing homes, job training, paying home heating oil bills, and obtaining legal counsel in civil matters. During the presidential campaign \u2026.Trump vowed that the solution to poverty was giving poor people incentives to work. But most of the proposed cuts in his budget target programs designed to help the working poor, as well as those who are jobless, cope. And many of them carry out their missions by disbursing money to the states, which establish their own criteria. The White House budget cuts will fall hardest on the rural and small town communities that Trump won, where 1 in 3 people are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 a rate that is 24 percent higher than in urban counties, according to a new analysis.\"\n\n-- OMB Director Mick Mulvaney strongly defended Trump\u2019s budget \u2013 and the long list of controversial cuts it contains \u2013 in a White House news conference, saying every program on the cutting board is either \u201cwasteful\u201d or \u201cineffective.\u201d Abby Phillips reports: \u201cHe stated broadly that the budget was intended to defund areas of the government that had been deemed wasteful or ineffective in the interest of being better stewards of taxpayer dollars. \u2018We can\u2019t spend money on programs just because they sound good,\u2019 Mulvaney said. \u2018That is about as compassionate as you can get.\u2019 Faced with repeated questions about line items in the federal budget that help fund programs like \u2026 after-school educational programs for poor, rural communities; and public broadcasting; Mulvaney insisted that the cuts were targeted at programs that didn't have a track record of success. \u2018The message the president sent right now is that we want to defund those,\u2019 Mulvaney said. \u2018And there are completely defensible reasons for doing that.\u2019 Trump's budget also makes significant cuts to scientific research, especially climate change, which is the target of some of the deep cuts within the State Department. \u2018We\u2019re not spending money on that anymore,\u2019 Mulvaney said of climate change research. \u2018We consider that to be a waste of your money.\u2019\u201d\n\nMORE BUDGET FALLOUT:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s proposal includes a plan to remove 30,000 FAA workers from the federal payroll. That group comprises 14,000 air traffic controllers and about 16,000 other FAA employees, many of whom work on a project called NextGen, Michael Laris reports. The program is a combination of several projects aimed at increasing the speed of air travel, saving airline fuel and accommodating a 20 percent increase in passengers in the next 20 years. The plan would also shutter federal support for Amtrak\u2019s long-distance train service.\n\n-- The plan also proposes eliminating three airport security programs developed after 9/11, diverting the money to help fund Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico border wall. (Ashley Halsey III)\n\n-- The New York Police Department said Trump\u2019s spending plan would gut critical counter-terrorism efforts that would make the nation\u2019s largest city less safe. From Mark Berman: \u201cPolice say the funding cuts would hit everything from intelligence analysis to active-shooter training. The blunt assessment was delivered by the top law enforcement officer in Trump\u2019s hometown, who leads an agency tasked with defending the city against terrorism \u2026 \u2018Under the president\u2019s proposal, nearly all federal funding to the NYPD would be eradicated,\u2019 [NYC police commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill said]. \u2018This funding is absolutely critical. It is the backbone of our entire counter-terrorism apparatus.\u2019 O\u2019Neill described the federal funding that would be lost as \u2018essential\u2019 to numerous aspects of the NYPD\u2019s counter-terrorism activities, including the city\u2019s intelligence analyst program, active-shooter training provided to tens of thousands of officers and the department\u2019s bomb squad.\u201d\n\n-- The U.S. Institute of Peace \u2013 which was created to help manage conflict resolution around the world, and whose staffers have been dispatched to some of the most dangerous places around the globe -- is slated for elimination. Carol Morello reports: \u201c[The] deep spending cuts proposed for foreign aid prompted an immediate backlash across the spectrum in Congress and among humanitarian organizations and religious groups. Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the cuts a \u2018catastrophic mistake,\u2019 while Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.), the committee chairman, expressed concern that cuts in diplomacy will hurt efforts to combat terrorism. Mercy Corps called the foreign aid cuts \u2018reckless, dangerous and irresponsible.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- After school programs for 16 million kids could lose funding. (Emma Brown)\n\n-- The Meals for Wheels program would get slashed. Mulvaney said it is \u201cjust not showing any results,\u201d drawing howls of protest from advocates. The program provides food aid to needy senior citizens who, because of physical limitations or financial reasons, have difficulty shopping for or preparing meals for themselves. (Christopher Ingraham)\n\n-- The budget disappointed leaders of historically black colleges and universities, who met with Trump last month in the hopes of securing additional funding for scholarships, technology and campus infrastructure. Rather than expanding Pell grants for low-income students, the proposal raids $4 billion from the program\u2019s reserves. (Danielle Douglas-Gabriel)\n\n-- One potential problem ahead: firing federal workers is not nearly as easy as Trump\u2019s proposal makes it seem. Eric Yoder and Lisa Rein report: \u201cLaying off federal workers requires going through a formal process that can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to the workplace \u2026 Under [Trump\u2019s] budget proposal, federal employees at many agencies may need to acquaint themselves with a lately dormant but still much-feared term: Reduction in Force. RIFs have not been used widely for decades. It is a complex process that catalogues and ranks employees based on the work they do and where, their employment status, veteran status, length of service and performance ratings. Employees in eliminated jobs in some cases may be able to displace lower-ranked employees while keeping their higher pay rates temporarily \u2014 meaning the projected savings don\u2019t always materialize. And there are job placement rights, appeal rights and severance pay entitlements for those ultimately let go. In some cases, unions are able to bargain on behalf of their members.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cWhat a Presidential budget really represents is a wish list and a numerical expression of the President\u2019s political philosophy,\u201d the New Yorker\u2019s John Cassidy explains: \u201c\u2019Philosophy\u2019 isn\u2019t a word often associated with [Trump], but this partial budget outline\u2014the White House is promising to release a fuller version later\u2014accurately reflects the impulses, prejudices, and slogans that animated Trump\u2019s campaign. Indeed, his budget director has said that he saw his job as taking what Trump said on the stump and translating it into figures. In carrying out this task, Mulvaney performed a public service of sorts. Thanks to his translation, the entire world can see what America would look like if Trumpism were fully converted into practice. The country would be an uglier, less equal, less prosperous, more paranoid, more myopic, and more mean-spirited place. Its claims that it\u2019s a role model for other countries would be besmirched, perhaps beyond redemption. And far from being rendered great again, it would be a weaker world power. In the long term, the prosperity of the country as a whole depends on it having a skilled labor force; world-beating science, technology, and arts; first-rate public infrastructure; and a clean and healthy environment. This budget, if it ever went into effect, would undercut all of these things.\u201d\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chair Diane Black (R-Tenn.), joined by Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), presides over a hearing to advance the health care bill. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nHEALTH CARE LATEST:\n\n-- The GOP proposal cleared a key hurdle, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists. Mike DeBonis and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cAll of the panel\u2019s Republicans and five Democrats supported a motion to change the system of tax credits created under the plan to ensure they are \u2018afforded to the population that they are intended to serve,\u2019 an idea embraced across the ideological spectrum, including among centrists whose votes could be key. The committee voted along party lines for a pair of motions supporting additional cuts to Medicaid beyond what\u2019s in the bill \u2014 and for a third motion endorsing a requirement that \u2018able-bodied\u2019 participants in the program work in exchange for their benefits. It remains unclear whether the Budget Committee\u2019s nonbinding recommendations will make it into the final bill.\u201d The panel voted 19 to 17 overall in favor of the bill, with three Republicans \u2013 Reps. Dave Brat, Gary Palmer, and Mark Sanford \u2013 voting against it. All three are members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n-- Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said his group is now drafting changes to the bill that they believe could garner \u201cwidespread support,\u201d which he said could be released as soon as today. He declined to release additional details but said he was in talks with \u201cmultiple senators\u201d about it. \u201cWe\u2019re working very diligently to try to make sure that any amendment that we put forth has a real chance of success,\u201d he said.\n\n-- But even as the bill made incremental progress, its overall fate remains very much in doubt. In an interview with the Portland Press-Herald, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would not vote for the bill without significant changes: \u201cThis is not a bill I could support in its current form,\u201d the moderate Republican said.\n\n-- \u201cThe sleeping giants of the Obamacare debate remain Republican moderates in the House,\u201d says Paul Kane. \u201cArch conservatives have come to define the House Republican brand this decade, pushing the Treasury to the edge of default in 2011 [and] shutting down the government in 2013 \u2026 Now, however, [Ryan] is dealing with a different rebellious flank within the House Republican Conference ... Larger in number but softer in tone than their conservative counterparts, moderate Republicans are shaping up to be at least as big a hurdle to achieving the long-held goal of repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a more market-oriented series of policies. These Republicans are getting their share of meetings with Ryan and his leadership team, voicing their concerns about the impact specific pieces of the bill would have in their districts. They are making clear that any negative fallout from these policy moves would place their seats in jeopardy in next year\u2019s midterm elections, a fate that Ryan understands would open the door to losing the House majority. And, of course, these moderates are making their case in a much quieter fashion than members of the House Freedom Caucus.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cWhom to trust when it comes to health-care reform? Trump supporters put their faith in him,\u201d from Jenna Johnson in Nashville: \u201cSoon after Charla McComic\u2019s son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a \u2018blessing from God\u2019 that she believes was made possible by [Trump]. \u2018I think it was just because of the tax credit,\u2019 said McComic \u2026 The price change was actually thanks to a subsidy made possible by former president [Obama\u2019s] Affordable Care Act, which is still in place, not by the tax credits proposed by Republicans as part of the health-care bill still being considered by Congress. It has been difficult for many Americans to keep up with the changes brought by Obamacare and exactly how the Republican proposal, if enacted, would affect their lives. But for Trump\u2019s most dedicated supporters, it\u2019s simply easier to trust the president is making things better and will follow through on his promise to provide \u2018insurance for everybody\u2019 and \u2018great health care for a fraction of the price.\u2019 McComic said she\u2019s not worried about her disability benefits changing or her 3-year-old granddaughter getting kicked off Medicaid or her 33-year-old son\u2019s premiums going up. \u2018So far, everything\u2019s been positive, from what I can tell,\u2019 she said.\"\n\nQuote du jour: McComic says she has never trusted a president the way she trusts Trump. Referencing the work she did on his behalf in the months leading up to the election, she said her and her relatives asked themselves, \"Who else would we do this for, besides Trump?\" \"We agreed on the Lord,\" she said. \"We would stand here for the Lord, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel talks to students yesterday in Berlin. (Michael Kappeler/pool photo via AP)\n\nTHE WORLD RECALIBRATES:\n\n-- Angela Merkel will meet with Trump at the White House today after postponing her visit because of the snowstorm earlier in the week. \u201cIt's a visit that seems a clash of geopolitical poles and personalities \u2014 Trump, the maverick, shoot-from-the-hip outsider and Merkel, the bookish, calm and experienced policy wonk,\u201d Ishaan Tharoor reports in his newsletter. \u201cTrump stands at the forefront of a new trend in mainstream Western politics, a populist challenge to the status quo anchored in ethnic nationalism. Merkel, on the other hand, is arguably the de facto guardian of the liberal order once authored by the United States. Although a center-right politician herself, she has set about defending international institutions as well as the broader politics of integration and tolerance now seemingly under assault from Trump and his far-right European counterparts. But Merkel arrives at the White House with a message of unity and collaboration. She will bring a number of CEOs of leading German companies in tow \u2014 a pro-trade agenda Trump certainly understands \u2014 and will stress the significance of the overall German-U.S. partnership.\"\n\n-- \u201cWilders vows to be a player in forming of Dutch government despite 2nd-place finish,\u201d by Michael Birnbaum: \u201cThe Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders acknowledged Thursday that voters denied him a chance to rule his nation. But to many Dutch Muslims, his victory was secured long before his nation\u2019s nail-biter election. The reelected Dutch prime minister told immigrants to fit in or get out. A likely coalition partner wants to impose restrictions on refugees. A nation once known for its laid-back tolerance is now focused on its divisions. And while European leaders breathed a sigh of relief that a raucous populist had been beaten back ahead of elections this year in France and Germany, many Muslims say that Wilders\u2019s raw racism is still ascendant. Europe has a new face, they say \u2014 and it\u2019s that of the blond-haired bomb thrower from the Netherlands.\u201d\n\nSean Hannity tapes a segment for his show with Sean Spicer.

Andania, plain and sturdy, pulled into New York Harbor on April 11, 1923, after a slow journey from Liverpool, England. In a third-class cabin was a gray-eyed Irishman named Richard Michael Cawley, fleeing poverty and war. The son of a tailor from a rural village, Mr. Cawley, then 20, had come of age during a guerrilla conflict. Now, with Irish fighting Irish, he had made his way to America \u2026 He had the equivalent of $23. And though records show he did not become a citizen until 1941, a decade after he married, historians say that was typical; many Irish came to America not quite sure they would stay. He would settle in Chicago \u2026 marry a teacher; find work as a streetcar driver; and sing ballads by the piano on Saturday nights.

They worry such tactic will discourage undocumented immigrants from appearing in court to testify as witnesses for prosecutors. Criminal defense lawyer Octavio Chaidez said his client is among those taken into custody by ICE agents, who arrested him at the Los Angeles Superior Court in Pasadena. He said he had just finished a criminal court appearance with his client when four agents swooped in, confirmed his name and took his client away. \u2018It was very shocking because it occurred inside of a courthouse, and the reason for the detention had nothing to do with that proceeding,\u2019 recalled Chaidez, who would not say if his client has a criminal history.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cNDP Candidate Removes Post with Beyonc\u00e9 Lyrics after Cultural Appropriation Accusations,\u201d from National Review: \u201cNew Democratic party candidate Niki Ashton has deleted her social-media posts containing Beyonc\u00e9 lyrics because a Twitter account attributed to Vancouver\u2019s Black Lives Matter said that using those lyrics was \u2018appropriating black culture.\u2019 Ashton had posted \u2018Like Beyonc\u00e9 says, to the left. Time for an unapologetic turn to the left for the #NDP, for social, racial, enviro, and economic justice. #ndpldr\u2019 above a meme that read \u2018To the Left, to the Left \u2026\u2019 Now, this may seem like a harmless post. It may seem like just another politician shamelessly trying to connect with voters by demonstrating that she, like, knows things about pop culture. But apparently not, because in response, a Twitter account attributed to Vancouver\u2019s chapter of Black Lives Matter tweeted\u201d: \u201c\u2026 Appropriating Black culture is not intersectional feminism. Please delete your \u2018to the left\u2019 FB post & address the issue.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nAt the White House: Trump will meet with the Republican Study Committee before holding a listening session on veterans\u2019 affairs.
