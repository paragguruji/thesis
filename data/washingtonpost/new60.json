A Michigan man claimed his sick Iraqi mother died a day after being turned away from traveling to the U.S. as a result of the executive order.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed us,\u201d the man, Mike Hager, told Detroit\u2019s Fox 2, claiming that if his mother had made it to the United States as scheduled, she would have received the medical treatment necessary to survive. A number of national news outlets published the account, linking to the original interview.\n\nBut late Tuesday night, the story began to fall apart. The local Fox affiliate \u201creceived many questions about the validity of Hager\u2019s claims that his mother died waiting to be approved to come home,\u201d it wrote. On Wednesday afternoon, the Fox station published a story with the headline: \u201cMan who claimed mom died in Iraq after Trump\u2019s ban lied, Imam confirms.\u201d\n\nSources close to the family also told The Washington Post that the man appears to have fabricated the tale.\n\n[Judge halts deportations as refugee ban causes worldwide furor]\n\nA leading imam in Dearborn, Mich., who oversees a congregation of primarily Iraqi refugees, including Hager\u2019s family, said Hager\u2019s mother actually died at least five days before Trump\u2019s executive order was put into place.\n\nThe imam, Husham Al-Husainy, said Hager sent him a message last month informing him that he would be traveling to Iraq to see his sick mother, Naimma. On Jan. 22 \u2014 two days after Trump was inaugurated \u2014 community members and posts on Facebook informed Al-Husainy of the woman\u2019s death. She had been living in Iraq for quite some time, and she died in Karbala, Iraq of kidney failure, he said.\n\nAl-Husainy, leader of the Karbalaa Islamic Educational Center in Dearborn, said he helped lead a number of community prayer services in her honor over the course of the next three days. Al-Hajar had lived in Dearborn on and off since 1995.\n\n\u201cShe is a very respected lady,\u201d he said. \u201cI know them all very well and they are a very respected family.\u201d\n\nWhen reached by telephone on Wednesday, Hager told The Post that he could not talk because he was dealing with family matters, and he later did not answer his phone. He told Fox, in a text message: \u201cI did not make anything up.\u201d\n\nHager, a Dearborn resident who is also listed in public records with the name Mohammed Al-Hajar, reportedly fled Iraq with his family during the Gulf War. After spending four years in a refugee camp, they were resettled in the U.S., Fox 2 reported. A few years later, he decided to return to his home country as an American serviceman, working with the U.S. Special Forces as an interpreter and adviser.\n\nHis cousin, Tony Al-Shammeree, also an Iraqi refugee and American citizen living in the Detroit suburbs, stood by the family\u2019s story in an interview with The Post.\n\nHe claimed that \u201cTrump killed her,\u201d and said the family was mourning the loss of his aunt. To his knowledge, his aunt died after Trump\u2019s travel ban went into effect on Friday, Jan. 27, he said. He claimed there are \u201chaters\u201d trying to \u201csmear\u201d his cousin\u2019s name by alleging he lied. He declined to provide records to corroborate the date of his aunt\u2019s death.\n\nThe imam said there was a grain of truth to the family\u2019s account: if she had been treated in a U.S. hospital, as opposed to an Iraqi hospital, Al-Husainy said, \u201cshe would have survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Trump killed her? No, I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d he said, adding that he is certain the woman died days before the travel ban. \u201cAnybody who lies, or gives fake information, is going to hurt the Muslims. Because Muslims should be truth tellers.\u201d\n\nAl-Husainy said he voted for Trump, but he believes it is unfair for the travel ban to include Iraqis. \u201cDon\u2019t victimize the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he was fighting terrorism, so let\u2019s give him a chance. Let\u2019s support him.\u201d\n\nHager claimed in his original interview with Fox that he was traveling with his niece, two nephews, and his mother, who were all green-card holders. As they were waiting in line at the airport in Iraq on Friday, he was told that he could pass through because he was a U.S. citizen. But his family members \u2014 including his mother \u2014 weren\u2019t allowed, he said.\n\nHager was born in Iraq and fled during the Gulf War. He lived in a refugee camp with his family for four years before settling in the United States.\n\n\u201cI was just shocked. I had to put my mom back on the wheelchair and take her back and call the ambulance and she was very very upset,\u201d Hager said in the interview. \u201cShe knew right there if we send her back to the hospital she\u2019s going to pass away \u2014 she\u2019s not going to make it.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s order, signed Friday, suspends admission to the United States of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations \u2014 notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "iraqi", "mother", "tale", "trump", "ban", "family", "days", "fox", "iraq", "unravels", "united", "trumps", "woman", "died", "dying", "claimed"], "summary": "A Michigan man claimed his sick Iraqi mother died a day after being turned away from traveling to the U.S. as a result of the executive order.\nThe local Fox affiliate \u201creceived many questions about the validity of Hager\u2019s claims that his mother died waiting to be approved to come home,\u201d it wrote.\nTo his knowledge, his aunt died after Trump\u2019s travel ban went into effect on Friday, Jan. 27, he said.\nNo, I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d he said, adding that he is certain the woman died days before the travel ban.\nBecause Muslims should be truth tellers.\u201dAl-Husainy said he voted for Trump, but he believes it is unfair for the travel ban to include Iraqis."}
