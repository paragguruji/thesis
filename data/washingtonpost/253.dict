And legal analysts say it might not go far enough to allay the judiciary\u2019s concerns.\n\nA senior White House official said Wednesday that Trump will issue a revised executive order on immigration next week, as the administration is working to make sure the implementation goes smoothly. Trump had said previously that the order would come this week. Neither the president nor his top advisers have detailed exactly what the new order will entail. Miller\u2019s comments on Fox News, while vague, seem to suggest the changes might not be substantive. And that could hurt the administration\u2019s bid to lift the court-imposed suspension on the ban, analysts said.\n\n[Trump considers writing \u2018brand new\u2019 immigration order]\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to moot out litigation, which is to say, \u2018Look, this litigation is no longer necessary,\u2019 it is very bad to say our intent here is to engage in the prohibited outcome,\u201d said Leon Fresco, who worked in the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nTrump\u2019s original travel ban temporarily barred from entering the United States refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya. When it was first implemented, State Department officials unilaterally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and the order seemed to affect even legal permanent residents, though the White House counsel soon clarified that it should not.\n\nA federal district judge in Washington state suspended the ban Feb. 3, and a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later upheld that freeze. While the Justice Department could have appealed to the full appeals court \u2014 or even to the Supreme Court \u2014 it asked the 9th Circuit judges last week to hold off because a new executive order was in the works.\n\n\u201cRather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote.\n\n[4 ways the Trump administration could fight for its travel ban]\n\nOfficials still plan a new order, but White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that they would not rescind the old one. And speaking to Fox News\u2019s Martha MacCallum, Miller seemed to play down how substantial even the revisions would be \u2014 which would seem to put him at odds with the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cWell, one of the big differences that you\u2019re going to see in the executive order is that it\u2019s going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn\u2019t exist previously. And so these are mostly minor technical differences,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, you\u2019re still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country, but you\u2019re going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court and those will be addressed. But in terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.\u201d\n\nLegal analysts have said previously that there are obvious ways in which the order could be cleaned up to help it pass legal muster \u2014 though anything that maintains outright bans might face a tough court battle.\n\nTrump could craft an order that clearly exempts green-card holders \u2014 who have the best case to sue over the order \u2014 and he could also potentially exempt any current visa holders. But the 9th Circuit panel said that would not address claims \u201cby citizens who have an interest in specific noncitizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd no matter what it does, the Trump administration must contend with the president\u2019s own call on the campaign trail for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and campaign surrogate Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s claim that Trump said \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and asked him to form a commission to determine \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in Virginia referenced those comments in ordering the ban frozen with respect to Virginia residents and institutions, calling it \u201cunrebutted evidence\u201d that Trump\u2019s directive might violate the First Amendment. That is important because if judges found even the new order was designed to discriminate against Muslims \u2014 and not to protect national security \u2014 they might similarly strike it down.The president does possess broad power to set immigration policy, and even his original executive order might ultimately pass legal muster, analysts have said. So far, courts have just weighed temporary injunctions on the ban, not directly and finally deciding whether Trump exceeded his authority.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that the new executive order just makes technical changes, then we don\u2019t see it solving any of the legal problems,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who is involved in a legal challenge to the ban in New York.\n\nAt the White House press briefing Wednesday, Spicer said he was confident the administration would ultimately prevail in court, but in the revised order officials had been \u201cvery clear about understanding what the court said, and trying to tailor that specifically.\u201d\n\nHe also said he was not concerned that Trump\u2019s prior remarks about targeting Muslims would hinder the administration\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThe president was very clear in his executive order that these were countries that we didn\u2019t have the proper vetting for when it came to ensuring the safety of Americans,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the executive order said. \u2026 It was crafted in a way that was very clear about the countries and was not focused on anything else but the vetting requirements.\u201d\n\nRevisions, analysts said, could ultimately help Trump prevail \u2014 particularly if he applied a ban only to the issuance of new visas, and if he issued robust procedures for those whose visas were revoked to challenge that action. His and Giuliani\u2019s comments would be an obstacle, but they would not necessarily block him forever from using his powers on immigration.\n\n\u201cAre you permanently prohibited from ever doing something like this because you at one time said something that was inappropriate?\u201d Fresco said. \u201cThe courts will have to decide what they believe here.\u201d\n\nPhilip Rucker and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-22", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
