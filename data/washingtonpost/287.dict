(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nAn Iranian Worcester Polytechnic Institute student, thought to be previously unable to make his way into the United States because of President Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban, has landed at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, a school spokeswoman said.\n\nThe student, Behnam Partopour, 27, flew into Boston from Frankfurt on a Lufthansa airlines flight, the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman, Colleen Wamback, said Partopour had a student visa \u2014 though it was not immediately clear how \u2014 given that Trump\u2019s ban would have required it to be revoked.\n\nPartopour was reportedly among a number of people aboard a Lufthansa flight who had previously been blocked from entering the country by Trump\u2019s executive order but were now being allowed through. Their arrivals could be significant, suggesting there is at least some temporary leeway in the ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nA Boston Globe reporter at the airport wrote on Twitter that a woman from Iraq was the first to make her way past Customs and Border Protection into the U.S. The reporter wrote that she embraced family amid cheers from a crowd that had gathered.\n\n1.

Asgari tried twice to board flights to the United States but was turned away because of the ban. A volunteer legal team operating at the airport posted a picture of her at the airport on Twitter.\n\nWelcome home Samira! pic.twitter.com/zt3rNdGawS \u2014 Open Boston (@openboston) February 3, 2017\n\nIt was unclear how, exactly, Partopour and others were allowed to board a U.S.-bound plane and then enter the country through Boston. Wamback said Partopour\u2019s visa had been issued before the executive order but was delayed in getting to him through the mail. Alison Duffy, another school spokeswoman, said Partopour, a PhD student in chemical engineering, had been working on a project in Germany but had returned to Iran to renew his visa. She said she believed he had not previously attempted to come back to the country, mindful that he might be stopped by the executive order.\n\n\u201cWe just want this student back here doing his work,\u201d Duffy said.\n\n[No matter what you call it, Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration will be tough to overturn]\n\nOn Thursday, before the flight had landed, spokeswomen from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security said they would have to research the matter. They did not return messages Friday after the flight had landed.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s order, the State Department revoked all valid nonimmigrant and immigrant visas of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In a letter, Edward J. Ramotowski, State Department deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the revocation would not apply to \u201cany visa exempted on the basis of a determination made by the secretaries of State and Homeland Security,\u201d and those exemptions would be determined \u201con a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest.\u201d\n\nThe airline Lufthansa had posted on its website Thursday night a vague notice that Trump\u2019s executive order was \u201csuspended\u201d on flights to Boston, where a federal court had declared that \u2014 at least until Sunday \u2014 no one was to be detained or removed who \u201cabsent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.\u201d\n\nThe airline, though, said that only those with \u201cvalid travel documents\u201d would be eligible to board. That would apparently not be the case for the tens of thousands of people whose visas were revoked. Lufthansa later removed the language about the executive order being suspended.\n\n[Homeland Security inspector general will review implementation of Trump immigration ban]\n\nChristina Semmel, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa, declined to comment on when the airline began allowing travel to Boston. She said Lufthansa was simply following guidance it and other carriers had received from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\n\u201cThe airline community commenced transporting passengers and accepting bookings after CPB confirmed it was abiding by the Massachusetts court order,\u201d she said.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection official from Boston emailed airlines on Sunday and declared it was \u201cunlawful to bring into the United States any alien who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa,\u201d according to a copy of the message obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nOfficials with the ACLU nonetheless hailed the news, declaring on Twitter that Lufthansa was \u201cnow boarding travelers from the seven banned countries\u201d in accordance with the order of the federal court in Massachusetts. On Friday, government lawyers argued that order \u2014 which is set to expire on Sunday \u2014 was no longer necessary, and a judge said he would take their arguments under advisement and issue a ruling later. The ACLU is pushing to have the order extended.\n\n1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.
