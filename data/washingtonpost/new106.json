Watson wrote that the government\u2019s \u201cnarrowly defined list\u201d of who might be exempt was not supported by either the Supreme Court decision partially unfreezing the ban or by the law.\n\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The Government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nWatson wrote that refugees with an assurance from a resettlement agency could also be exempt from the ban.\n\n[Travel ban takes effect as State Department defines \u2018close family\u2019]\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Friday that the Justice Department would \u201creluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court to again vindicate the rule of law and the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, we are faced with a situation in which a single federal district court has undertaken by a nationwide injunction to micromanage decisions of the coequal executive branch related to our national security,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cBy this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nLater, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the government to enforce the executive order as it had been, arguing that Watson\u2019s decision \u201cempties the Court\u2019s decision of meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly this Court can definitively settle whether the government\u2019s reasonable interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s stay,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote.\n\nMany justices left Washington to travel after their most recent term ended, but they often rule in emergencies when they are in different places. In the meantime, Department of Homeland Security and State Department spokesmen said their agencies were reviewing the decision with the Justice Department, and working on implementation of Watson\u2019s decision.\n\nAt issue is how far the administration can go in keeping out relatives of U.S. residents under the president\u2019s travel ban, which temporarily bars entry for all refugees and the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and \u00adYemen.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not against those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States.\n\nThe court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d\n\nThe administration said it would let into the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters, fiances, and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here.\n\nStill banned, however, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees who had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency.\n\nThe state of Hawaii, which has been suing over the travel ban, soon asked Watson to intervene.\n\nThe district judge had initially ruled against Hawaii in the case, telling it to go straight to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit also rebuffed the state\u2019s request, although it offered a way forward: Watson, the appeals court said, would have jurisdiction over a reframed request. Hawaii then filed such a request, setting up Watson\u2019s ruling Thursday \u2014 which allows the entry of those the government had wanted to keep out.\n\nHawaii Attorney General Douglas S. Chin said in a statement: \u201cThe federal court today makes clear that the U.S. government may not ignore the scope of the partial travel ban as it sees fit. Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough. Courts have found that this Executive Order has no basis in stopping terrorism and is just a pretext for illegal and unconstitutional discrimination. We will continue preparing for arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in October.\u201d\n\nWhile the Supreme Court partially unfroze Trump\u2019s travel ban, it did so only temporarily, indicating it would truly take up the case in the fall. By that time, the bans might have expired. The barring of new visas to those from the six Muslim-majority countries is supposed to last 90 days, and the barring of refugees is supposed to last 120 days.\n\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-07-14", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "trump", "exempt", "ban", "supreme", "judge", "rules", "court", "decision", "refugees", "relatives", "federal", "justice", "watson", "department", "extended", "grandparents"], "summary": "Grandparents and other extended relatives are exempt from President Trump\u2019s travel ban, a federal judge in Hawaii declared late Thursday, again stopping the administration from implementing the president\u2019s controversial executive order in the way that it wants.\nU.S. District Judge Derrick K.
