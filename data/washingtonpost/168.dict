A proclamation President Donald Trump signed Sunday, Sept. 24, 2017, would suspend all immigrant and non-immigrant visas for North Koreans. But the measure is largely symbolic since most North Koreans in the U.S. are based at the United Nations and certain North Koreans are banned from traveling due to sanctions. (Wong Maye-E, File/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new restrictions on visitors from several nations are largely symbolic in North Korea\u2019s case, because not many of its citizens visit the United States.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s authoritarian government doesn\u2019t allow most of its 24 million people to travel abroad, except in special cases such as for jobs that bring in foreign currency or participation in sporting events. North Korea has tens of thousands of workers abroad, but none are believed to be in the United States.\n\nReports say there is a dwindling number of North Koreans visiting the United States amid the standoff over the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic measure,\u201d Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said of including North Korea in the latest U.S. immigration restrictions. \u201cNorth Korea won\u2019t probably make any response.\u201d\n\nAccording a report last month by broadcaster Voice of America, the United States issued 100 visas to North Koreans last year. VOA, citing its analysis of visa records, said 52 of them were business or tourist visas while the rest were diplomats. From March to June this year, the U.S. issued 18 visas to North Koreans, according to the report.\n\nThe figures were a sharp decrease from the period of 1997-2001, when more than 1,200 North Koreans acquired business or tourist visas each year, VOA said.\n\nThe broadcaster said there\u2019s no record of the whereabouts or activities in the United States of those on business or tourism visas. North Korean government officials are based at the country\u2019s diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York.\n\nIn addition to North Korea, Trump\u2019s presidential proclamation, signed Sunday, places indefinite restrictions on citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The U.S. will also bar the entry of certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate families. The changes are to take effect Oct. 18.\n\nThe U.S. ban came on the day that Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire, 90 days after it went into effect. The inclusion of Venezuela and North Korea appeared to be an attempt to block challenges from advocacy groups and others who have called the restrictions a ban on Muslims.\n\nThe suspension of immigrant and non-immigrant visas for North Koreans comes amid an escalating war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last week, Kim called Trump a \u201cmentally deranged U.S. dotard\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s threats to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the North. Trump later said Kim is \u201cobviously a madman who doesn\u2019t mind starving or killing his people.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea last month described the outgoing ban as a measure that revealed \u201cAmerican ferocity, lack of judgment and extreme recklessness.\u201d But as of late Monday, the country\u2019s state media hadn\u2019t made any comments on the new ban.\n\nThe United States and North Korea don\u2019t have diplomatic relations because they remain technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Starting Sept. 1, the Trump administration has barred Americans from traveling to the North, after a U.S. student was sent home in a coma and later died after more than a year in detention in the North.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
