But is it really unconstitutional?", "text": "A SECOND federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump\u2019s travel ban on six majority Muslim countries, in effect taking his prolific statements on the campaign trail literally and seriously to impugn the ban\u2019s ostensible purpose of safeguarding national security. \u201cWe cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face,\u201d wrote the chief justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Richmond, for the court\u2019s majority.\n\nAs policy, the court rightly made the point that Mr. Trump\u2019s ban rests on a filigree of dubious assumptions, first and foremost that it would somehow safeguard the nation from terrorist attack. In the past four decades, no Americans have died in a terrorist attack in the United States carried out by immigrants from the six countries covered by Mr. Trump\u2019s revised ban: Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan. A Department of Homeland Security report shows that immigrants generally become radicalized many years after arriving in the United States, meaning that enhanced screening for visa applicants and refugees from those countries \u2014 the stated objective during the hoped-for ban \u2014 is unlikely to reduce the risk to national security.\n\nAs jurisprudence, the decision strikes us as iffier. Do Mr. Trump\u2019s often incendiary remarks and tweets as a candidate, and those of his campaign, form a legitimate basis for determining that the ban was motivated mainly by what the court called religious animus? The judges concluded that they do, as a matter of common sense. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine the Supreme Court disagreeing.\n\nPresidents have enjoyed, and deserve, broad leeway when it comes to setting immigration limits, as the court repeatedly acknowledged. The judges cited what they regard as the unique circumstances leading to Mr. Trump\u2019s ban as justification for intervening to halt what looked to many Americans like an insult to the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause, prohibiting religious favoritism. When Mr. Trump, on the stump, called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims coming to the United States,\u201d his intent seemed clear enough.\n\nBut Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, writing for the three Republican appointees who dissented from the opinion of the court\u2019s 10-member majority of Democratic appointees, made the hardly radical observation that what\u2019s said on the campaign trail may not be incontrovertible proof of a candidate\u2019s real intent, let alone that of an administration not yet formed. Campaign statements, Mr. Niemeyer wrote, \u201care explained, modified, retracted and amplified as they are repeated and as new circumstances and arguments arise. And they are often ambiguous.\u201d\n\nMuch as we find Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban offensive, imprudent and unwise; much as we believe it inflicts real harm not just on America\u2019s foreign policy objectives but also on families, communities and institutions in the United States, it\u2019s fair to wonder whether it really amounts to an attack on Islam and an affront to the Constitution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-05-28", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["imprudent", "travel", "wrote", "ban", "court", "united", "offensive", "trumps", "countries", "states", "unconstitutional", "really", "mr", "campaign", "attack"], "summary": "As policy, the court rightly made the point that Mr. Trump\u2019s ban rests on a filigree of dubious assumptions, first and foremost that it would somehow safeguard the nation from terrorist attack.\nIn the past four decades, no Americans have died in a terrorist attack in the United States carried out by immigrants from the six countries covered by Mr. Trump\u2019s revised ban: Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan.\nThe judges cited what they regard as the unique circumstances leading to Mr. Trump\u2019s ban as justification for intervening to halt what looked to many Americans like an insult to the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause, prohibiting religious favoritism.\nWhen Mr. Trump, on the stump, called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims coming to the United States,\u201d his intent seemed clear enough.\nCampaign statements, Mr. Niemeyer wrote, \u201care explained, modified, retracted and amplified as they are repeated and as new circumstances and arguments arise."}
