Boente said he would enforce the president\u2019s directive until he was replaced by Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala).\n\n[Who is Sally Yates? Meet the acting attorney general Trump fired for \u2018betraying\u2019 the Justice Department]\n\n\u201cYes, I will,\u201d he said in a brief phone interview with The Washington Post. \u201cI was enforcing it this afternoon. Our career department employees were defending the action in court, and I expect that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do tomorrow, appropriately and properly.\u201d\n\nLater Monday, he formally rescinded Yates\u2019s order and instructed Justice Department employees \u201cto do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our President.\u201d\n\nView Graphic Who is affected by Trump\u2019s travel ban\n\nThe move came just hours after Yates ordered the Justice Department not to defend Trump\u2019s immigration order, declaring in a memo that she was not convinced the order is lawful. Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure that the department\u2019s position is \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote. She wrote that \u201cfor as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\u201d\n\nThe stunning events marked the latest sign of turmoil over Trump\u2019s announcement Friday that he would shut the U.S. borders to refugees and those entering the country from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMore than 100 State Department diplomats have signed a memo objecting to Trump\u2019s order, arguing that it will not deter attacks on American soil. The document, which says Trump\u2019s ban will generate ill will toward U.S. citizens, is destined for what\u2019s known as the department\u2019s Dissent Channel, which was set up during the Vietnam War as a way for diplomats to signal to senior leadership their disagreement on foreign policy decisions.\n\nYates was a holdover from the Obama administration, but her move still represented notable disagreement from someone who would be on the front lines of implementing it.\n\nA Justice Department official said that hours after Yates released her memo refusing to defend the president\u2019s executive order, she was delivered a one-line letter from the head of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel saying that she had been removed. The White House then announced her firing with a statement criticizing her as \u201can Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to get serious about protecting our country,\u201d the statement said. \u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n[Read the White House statement on Sally Yates]\n\nSessions, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Justice Department permanently, is awaiting Senate confirmation, although it could come as early as this week. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider his nomination Tuesday, and the entire Senate must wait one day before voting. A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment.\n\nBoente (pronounced BEN-tay), who was sworn in at 9 p.m., said he would serve until Sessions is confirmed, which he understood from news reports might happen by week\u2019s end. He declined to say when or by whom he was approached to take over as acting attorney general, and he also declined to discuss the specifics of Yates\u2019s memo.\n\nBoente is a longtime federal prosecutor who has a remarkably low-key demeanor, although he has supervised high-profile investigations and prosecutions. Assistant U.S. attorneys from his office were involved in the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and they won the criminal convictions \u2014 which were later vacated \u2014 against former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell (R). Boente also led the prosecutions of former U.S. representative William J. Jefferson (D-La.) and former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin (D). At his swearing-in ceremony as U.S. attorney, then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch called him \u201cthat reliable middle child, the one you could always count on to be there for you.\u201d\n\nBoente would not have been first in the line of succession ordered by Obama, who had placed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, Chicago and Los Angeles ahead.\n\n[Who is new acting attorney general Dana Boente?]\n\nYates\u2019s refusal to defend to Trump\u2019s immigration order \u2014 and her firing over it \u2014 capped a day in which resistance to the ban fomented inside the government and across the country.\n\nCivil rights lawyers and others across the country increased the pressure on Trump on Monday to dial back the ban \u2014 filing legal challenges to the executive order as they worked to determine whether people were still being improperly denied entry or detained. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who worked on one of the legal challenges, said of Yates\u2019s memo, \u201cIt sends a very strong message that there\u2019s something very wrong with the Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, former president Barack Obama also weighed in on the executive action through a spokesman, seeming to back those demonstrating against Trump\u2019s decree and declaring his opposition to \u201cdiscriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d\n\nObama said that he was \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to protests at airports nationwide. He also disputed Trump\u2019s claim that his ban was based on Obama administration decisions.\n\nA Justice Department official familiar with the matter said Yates felt that she was in an \u201cimpossible situation\u201d and had been struggling with what to do about a measure she did not consider lawful. A Justice Department official confirmed over the weekend that the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel had been asked to review the measure to determine whether it was \u201con its face lawful and properly drafted.\u201d\n\nIn her memo, though, Yates said her role was broader. She wrote that an Office of Legal Counsel review does \u201cnot address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just,\u201d nor does it \u201ctake account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order\u2019s purpose.\u201d\n\nThat could be a reference to Trump\u2019s campaign trail comments about a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d or the recent assertion by Trump surrogate Rudolph W. Giuliani that the president had asked him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nDemocrats criticized Yates\u2019s firing as an unfair termination of someone who was following the law. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said, \u201cWhat the Trump administration calls betrayal is an American with the courage to say that the law and the Constitution come first.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the termination \u201cunderscores how important it is to have an attorney general who will stand up to the White House when they are violating the law,\u201d and said many have doubts about Sessions.\n\nOthers, though, turned their ire on Yates.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the president\u2019s order,\u201d senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News.\n\nMiller accused Yates of \u201crefusing to defend the lawful powers of the president.\u201d He also said he had no doubt about the order\u2019s legality.\n\nGeorge J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Yates\u2019s memo was a \u201cfoolish, naked political move by what appears to be an ambitious holdover official\u201d that would only create \u201cunnecessary disorder.\u201d\n\nEven with Yates gone, there remain serious questions about the implementation of the order. A lawsuit in Virginia asserted that dozens of people may have been forced to give up their green cards by Customs and Border Protection agents, although that figure could not immediately be substantiated. Lawyers in Los Angeles said they had received similar reports, though they were still exploring them.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Gelernt said that lawyers were \u201chaving trouble independently verifying anything because the government will not provide full access to all the detainees.\u201d Of particular concern, he said, was that the government had not turned over a list of detainees, as it had been ordered to do by a federal judge in New York. He said that lawyers might be back in federal court in the next day or so to forcibly get access to it.\n\n[ACLU: Delay Sessions confirmation vote until \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 is stopped]\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit in New York is perhaps the most significant of a growing number of legal challenges. The Council on American-Islamic Relations also filed a sweeping challenge Monday, alleging that the order is meant \u201cto initiate the mass expulsion of immigrant and non-immigrant Muslims lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d The lawsuit lists 27 plaintiffs, many of them lawful permanent residents and refugees who allege that Trump\u2019s order will deny them citizenship or prevent them from traveling abroad and returning home. Lawyers with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed a similar challenge in Washington state.\n\nBob Ferguson, Washington state\u2019s attorney general, also filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging broad, constitutional concerns with the order and its impact on Washington \u2014 making him the first state official to do so. That lawsuit has the support of Microsoft and Amazon.com, two companies based in Washington state. (Amazon owner Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post and has voiced Amazon\u2019s opposition to the order personally.)\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said that one lawsuit \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d and sought to minimize the action as simply subjecting 109 people to more rigorous screening. According to State Department statistics, about 90,000 people received nonimmigrant or immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015 from the seven countries affected by Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nRead more:\n\nSome international passengers entering the U.S. more easily, but members of Congress say they\u2019re still not getting answers\n\nScholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration\n\nJihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe, Rachel Weiner, Ellen Nakashima, Juliet Eilperin, John Wagner and Carol Morello contributed to this report.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/markberman", "type": "article"}
