Will Supreme Court conclude the same?", "text": "Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nA substantial majority of the judges who sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond delivered a rather remarkable judgment last week: The president of the United States is not to be believed.\n\nWill the Supreme Court conclude the same thing? And by \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d we mean \u201cJustice Anthony M. Kennedy,\u201d whose name was invoked 23 times in the 205 pages of majority opinions, concurrences and dissents in the appeals court\u2019s 10-to-3 rejection of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban.\n\n[Appeals court won\u2019t revive Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nIt appears that we will find out \u2014 the president\u2019s lawyers are likely to ask the high court this week to overturn the 4th Circuit opinion. Perhaps the administration will find a more receptive audience at 1 First Street than it has to date for the argument that judicial attempts to peer into the chief executive\u2019s motivations are inappropriate.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth another look at the remarkable rhetoric in Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory\u2019s majority opinion, which concludes that Trump\u2019s \u201ctrue reason\u201d for the travel ban was not protecting the nation\u2019s security but making good on a campaign promise born of anti-Muslim bias.\n\nAs Harvard law professor Noah Feldman put it in an essay for Bloomberg News, \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for a federal court to tell the president directly that he\u2019s lying; I certainly can\u2019t think of any other examples in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nGregory\u2019s 79-page opinion, joined in full by six judges, opens with the finding that Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d He devotes a large section to recounting Trump campaign rhetoric, tweets and website postings about imposing a ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\n[Trump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet, and it\u2019s causing problems for him]\n\nGregory noted an interview that Trump gave in 2016, when challenged about whether banning Muslims would be constitutional. \u201cPeople were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRemember this. And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as the reasonable observer\u2019s \u2018world is not made brand new every morning,\u2019 \u201d Gregory wrote, quoting from a Supreme Court precedent, \u201cnor are we able to awake without the vivid memory of these statements.\n\n\u201cWe cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face, for \u2018there\u2019s none so blind as they that won\u2019t see.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive order, which Gregory called EO-1, was issued just a week after the president took office. It barred the entry of citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations (Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya), ordered a temporary halt to refu\u00adgee arrivals and would have eventually given preference to those who were religious minorities in their countries, such as Christians. Several judges and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit shut it down.\n\n[Appeals court rules against Trump travel ban]\n\nTrump vowed to go to the Supreme Court that time, too, but eventually issued a new order, which Gregory called EO-2. The order removed Iraq from the list, deleted references to religion and added national security rationales for the policy.\n\nGregory again doubted the president\u2019s motives.\n\n\u201cAny national security justification for EO-2 was secondary to its primary religious purpose and was offered as more of a \u2018litigating position\u2019 than as the actual purpose of EO-2,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe president\u2019s credibility took other hits in the 4th Circuit ruling in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump.\n\nJudge Stephanie Thacker said she would not consider Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign but that he had said enough in his short time as president to reveal his true intentions. She called the revised order \u201cthe proverbial wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nJudge James A. Wynn Jr. seemed to think Gregory had not gone far enough in his rhetoric; Wynn invoked in his concurrence the lessons of slavery and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\n\u201cWe again encounter the affront of invidious discrimination \u2014 this time layered under the guise of a President\u2019s claim of unfettered congressionally delegated authority to control immigration . . . Laid bare, this executive order is no more than what the President promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe three dissenting judges \u2014 all were nominated to the appeals court by Republican presidents, while those in the majority were nominated by Democrats \u2014 seemed stunned not just by the boldness of their colleagues but by what has happened to their court, which was once one of the nation\u2019s most conservative.\n\nJudge Paul V. Niemeyer said the majority breezed past Supreme Court rulings that give the president enormous power to make immigration policy and decide who is allowed to enter the country.\n\nSo long as the order is issued for a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the [plaintiffs\u2019] First Amendment interests,\u201d the court has ruled.\n\nThe majority compounded its error, Niemeyer wrote, by relying on the campaign statements. He welcomed the next round of review.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds \u2014 one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhich brings things back to Kennedy. He is the pivotal member of the court, the justice most often in the majority when the divided court decides a controversial issue. But he is especially important on this issue.\n\nIn a 2015 case, Kennedy generally agreed with the rule that courts should not \u201clook behind\u201d immigration decisions. But, along with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., he said that an \u201caffirmative showing of bad faith,\u201d plausibly shown, might free courts to probe the rationale of a decision.\n\nIt is hardly clear how the Supreme Court will react to a case that mixes profound questions about the president\u2019s power to protect the country, Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the executive branch to make immigration decisions and the Constitution\u2019s admonition that government not single out one religion for disparagement.\n\nNiemeyer said his colleagues seem to acknowledge that the same directive issued by a different president would be acceptable.
