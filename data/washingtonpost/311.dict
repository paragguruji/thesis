His revised travel ban executive order bars people from six Muslim-majority countries from getting new U.S. visas. The order left Iraq off the list. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Trump and the Iraqi leader had discussed the ban in a telephone call several weeks ago and that the U.S. president had promised to review Iraq\u2019s status. The decision on Monday \u201cshowed an appreciation for the partnership with Iraq in fighting terrorism\u201d and would speed up the fight against the Islamic State, the spokesman said.\n\nThe relief in Iraq was in sharp contrast to the criticism of the revised order from human rights groups, which derided it as effectively a ban on Muslims as well as refugees and their advocates. The order suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days.\n\nThe order \u201cheartlessly targets the most vetted and most vulnerable population to enter the United States,\u201d David Miliband, president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, which resettles refugees in the United States, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban doesn\u2019t target those who are the greatest security risk, but those least able to advocate for themselves. Instead of making us safer, it serves as a gift for extremists who seek to undermine America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the ban is critical to public safety, and officials asserted Monday that the revised order would eliminate the chaos at airports worldwide that accompanied the initial executive order issued in January.\n\nMohamed Gabr, a Syrian refugee who lives with his family in Cairo and said he was supposed to be resettled in New Jersey before the initial ban, was still waiting to hear from his resettlement agency about when \u2014 and if \u2014 his family would be able to travel.\n\n[Trump\u2019s new travel ban still wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly U.S. terror attacks]\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMy condition is intolerable. For a year and eight months, we have been stuck here. For two months, I have been told to wait,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the uncertainty about their future, Gabr and his wife, Lamis el-Hamawi, said they were happy that the executive order had been narrowed, if only slightly.\n\n\u201cWe wish the Iraqis all the best,\u201d Hamawi said. \u201cThey are just like us, they faced the same horrors. We don\u2019t see any difference between us and them. We don\u2019t hate or discriminate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do,\u201d she said, referring to U.S. officials. \u201cBut we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe revised executive order comes as the United States is stepping up its involvement in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, including by sending hundreds of military advisers to front-line positions with Iraqi security forces wrestling for control of the northern city of Mosul.\n\nThe original White House ban was seen as especially egregious by Iraqi troops and commanders representing units that have suffered heavy losses in the grinding fight for Mosul.\n\n\u201cIt showed no appreciation at all for the sacrifices of Iraqis in fighting terrorism,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Sami al-Aridhi, commander of the second division of Iraq\u2019s U.S.-trained counterterrorism forces. \u201cIt had a negative impact on the psyche and morale of fighters, especially for the special forces, because we deal directly and closely with the Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, some of the resentment abated, Aridhi said, adding that he hoped to visit the United States someday, when the fight against the Islamic State has ended, \u201cand enter the country with respect: as an Iraqi who fought against terrorism consistently since 2003.\u201d\n\nHeba Mahfouz in Cairo and Louisa Loveluck in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat Trump changed in the new travel ban\n\nAway from Iraq\u2019s front lines, the Islamic State is creeping back in\n\n\u2018Tragedy\u2019 inside Mosul as food runs out and the battle against ISIS drags on\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
