The court will also hold a hearing on the case in the fall. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen President Trump announced in the winter that he would ban people from six mostly Muslim countries from entering the United States to protect national security, university leaders were some of the most outspoken opponents of the measure, warning it would hinder research and recruitment of the best talent in the world.\n\n\u201cIf left in place, the order threatens both American higher education and the defining principles of our country,\u201d Princeton University\u2019s president and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s president wrote in a February letter that was signed by nearly 50 top university leaders.\n\n[Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect, will consider case in the fall]\n\nOn Monday, some university leaders welcomed a Supreme Court ruling that Trump also claimed as a victory.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to allow a limited version of the ban to take effect, carving out exceptions that appear to exempt university students, faculty and lecturers. In October, the court will consider the case and the president\u2019s powers in immigration matters.\n\nVery grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\n\u201cWhile we are still reviewing the Court\u2019s decision, the Court has rightly recognized that students, faculty, and lecturers from the designated countries have a bona fide relationship with an American entity and should not be barred from entering the United States,\u201d Mary Sue Coleman, the president of the Association of American Universities, said in a statement Monday afternoon. \u201cThis should make clear to the world that the United States continues to welcome the most talented individuals from all countries to study, teach, and carry out research and scholarship at our universities.\u201d\n\n[\u2018They\u2019re afraid to come\u2019: University leaders worry Trump policies will deter international students]\n\nAn official with a higher-education association who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about the ruling said that at first read, it appears \u201cthe court basically agrees with us.\u201d It seems to very clearly protect the people the official was worried about \u2014 university students, faculty, lecturers \u2014 and would allow them to return to or remain on campus.\n\n\u201cWe believe that\u2019s the court\u2019s intent,\u201d said the official, who will watch to see how the ruling plays out in practice. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Department of Homeland Security and immigration authorities to live up to that intent.\u201d\n\n[Ohio State attacker, a refugee, should have been more thoroughly vetted, Senate Judiciary chair says]\n\nPrinceton University officials said in a statement Monday afternoon, \u201cWe appreciate the Supreme Court leaving in place the injunctions against the travel ban for any foreign national who has \u2018a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\u2019 and specifically illustrating that this includes foreign nationals who wish to enter the United States to visit a family member, students from the designated countries who have been admitted to American universities, individuals who have accepted an offer of employment, and lecturers invited to address an American audience.\u201d\n\nDaniel Day, a spokesman for the university, added that after the school\u2019s initial response, officials now need to study the decision in detail and will continue to monitor developments as they occur.\n\n[\u2018I am trusting the American people\u2019: Yale professor worries his wife and baby won\u2019t be allowed back from Iran]\n\nThe initial response from higher-education officials was not universal.\n\nWim Wiewel, the president of Portland State University, raised the broader issue of the long-term message being sent overseas.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision today to allow a limited form of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to be implemented until the court hears the case and makes a final ruling,\u201d Wiewel said in a statement.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s court action has no impact on Portland State\u2019s current international students from the six countries on the list or those who have been offered admissions. However, I\u2019m particularly concerned that banning people from the United States because of their country of origin sends a chilling message to all international students that we are not a welcoming place. So there could be a ripple effect on international students wanting to study at PSU and American universities in general.\u201d\n\n[Ivies, other leading colleges file brief joining challenge to Trump\u2019s order on immigration]\n\nEsther Brimmer, executive director and chief executive of NAFSA: Association of International Educators, said Monday evening in a written statement that international educators are pleased to be able to tell students and scholars with connections to the United States that, while the litigation continues, they could not be barred from the country because of nationality or religion.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, individuals from the affected countries with no ties to the United States will be subject to the ban on the grounds that a lack of connection to the United States somehow provides evidence of a national security threat. If that is the case, then we should be making every effort to create connections and ties through robust international exchange and travel, and we call on the administration to make clear in its guidance that prospective students and scholars should not be afraid to seek admission to the United States regardless of their current ties.\n\n\u201cFor refugees, however, this requirement of a prior connection to the United States is a devastating and unfair limitation on the very reason that countries provide refuge.\u201d\n\nAt the University of Hawaii, spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said that Hawaii is one of the most diverse places in the country and that the university is one of the most diverse universities in the country; they are defined by the variety of people and cultures living together in harmony. \u201cThe University of Hawai\u2019i is pleased that our accepted students will not be affected by the travel ban and that they will be able to travel freely to both engage in their academic studies and to return to their home countries as necessary during the time they\u2019re studying here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in a holding pattern right now,\u201d he added. If the case is heard in October, \u201cspring 2018 is when the actual decision will come out. We have a ways to go.\u201d\n\nThe case takes on questions of national security and religious discrimination; Trump has argued that the ban is necessary to ensure the United States is protected from extremists from overseas who wish to enter the country and harm Americans.\n\nCritics say his campaign rhetoric of the need for a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d indicates he is violating the country\u2019s principle of religious freedom.\n\n[\u2018I felt loved\u2019: Libyan student, banned from entry to the U.S., was able to return to George Mason University]\n\nThe ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 which had been blocked by lower courts \u2014 is meant to be a temporary measure while the government reviews its vetting procedures.\n\nThe court made clear that the ban cannot be enforced against \u201cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\u201d including those who wish to visit or live with family members and students who have been admitted to a U.S. university.\n\nFor individuals, a close familial relationship is required. A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member \u2026 clearly has such a relationship. As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO\u20132. The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.\n\nThree justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 objected to the partial stay, saying it would lead to a \u201cflood of litigation\u201d over what constitutes a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d before the overall case is resolved.\n\n[Surge in foreign students might be crowding Americans out of elite colleges]", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/susan.kinzie", "type": "article"}
