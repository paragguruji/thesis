McConnell said that Muslims, both in the United States and abroad, are key allies in the fight against terrorism and urged caution in regard to Trump\u2019s plan to implement \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for refugees from countries where a majority of the citizens are Muslim.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be careful. We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe comments came after a day of silence from McConnell on the issue. He did not offer any reaction in the early hours when the order caused mass chaos and outrage as Muslims were turned away at airports across the country. Republican leaders are facing intense criticism for backing the measure, which has been interpreted by some Democrats, human rights leaders and activists as effectively a ban on Muslims.\n\nMcConnell is one of a growing number of Republicans who have urged caution in implementing the order to block citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya from entering the country for at least 90 days. On Sunday, he left it to the judiciary to decide its legality.\n\n\u201cUltimately it is going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nMcConnell is among those who strongly opposed the concept of a Muslim ban when Trump touted the idea during the campaign. His decision to back the order, at least in part, is generally in line with that of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) who announced his support Friday. However, Ryan did not share McConnell\u2019s broader concerns in his statement.\n\nRyan said that while he supports the refu\u00adgee resettlement program, he thinks it is time to \u201creevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country,\u201d the speaker said in a statement.\n\nA growing number of other prominent Republicans have raised serious concerns about the decision to ban people traveling from the seven countries listed in the order.\n\n[WHIP COUNT: Here\u2019s where Republicans stand on Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban]\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a top Republican on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, also stopped short of criticizing the order, but he suggested that the action wasn\u2019t fully thought through by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have,\u201d Portman said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nPortman said that he supports the rulings by several federal judges staying the part of the order that affects legal permanent residents and visa holders and prevents them from entering the country.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Portman said of the judicial orders. \u201cAnd let\u2019s allow those people who have come here legally in this country to get out of detention \u2014 allow them to go to the Cleveland Clinic, for instance, as this doctor was banned from doing so.\u201d\n\nConcerns that the order was not properly reviewed were shared by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who called the process \u201cconfused.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good news is that its only got to do with a pause,\u201d McCain said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201cThe bad news is obviously this process and these conclusions were not vetted.\u201d\n\nMcCain said he worries that the order could bar Iraqi soldiers who are working with the United States from entering the country and that the chaos could become part of marketing efforts for ISIS and other terrorist organizations.\n\n\u201cI think the effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda,\u201dMcCain said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about our effect on the Iraqis right now.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, McCain and Portman joined several other Senate Republicans who expressed concerns on Saturday.\n\n[Facing intense criticism, some Republicans are speaking out against Trump\u2019s refugee ban. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren\u2019t among them.]\n\nSen Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) voiced some of the most vociferous objections to the order in a Saturday evening post on the blogging site Medium. Flake, a longtime opponent of the Muslim ban proposed by Trump, said the administration is right to be concerned about national security but said the measure too broadly blocks those who have already been vetted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry,\u201d Flake said in his post. \u201cEnhancing long-term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also supported Trump\u2019s focus on protecting the country\u2019s borders and backed connecting \u201cjihadi terrorism\u201d with Islam and particular countries. However, he said, the order is \u201ctoo broad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\u201d Sasse said in a statement released Saturday. \u201cOur generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said he has \u201ctechnical\u201d questions about how the order will be implemented but supports its purpose.\n\nOthers, including Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), announced tepid support and concerns on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe should value freedom & not surrender security. We can protect the homeland while upholding #religiousfreedom & refuge for the persecuted,\u201d Lankford tweeted.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["ban", "dont", "vetting", "republicans", "united", "states", "trumps", "religious", "country", "mcconnell", "order", "tests", "concerns"], "summary": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country, though he stopped short of rejecting the order in its entirety.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be careful.\nWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)The comments came after a day of silence from McConnell on the issue.\n\u201cUltimately it is going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far,\u201d McConnell said.\nMcConnell is among those who strongly opposed the concept of a Muslim ban when Trump touted the idea during the campaign."}
