Justin Amash, R-Mich., who is of Palestinian and Syrian descent, is the only Arab-American GOP lawmaker to fully opposed Trump\u2019s travel ban. He\u2019s seen here on Sept. 19, 2015, in Mackinac Island, Mich. (Carlos Osorio/AP)\n\nRep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was born in the United States, the son of a Palestinian refugee father and a Syrian immigrant mother. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that he is one of the GOP\u2019s most outspoken critics of President Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had both of those aspects in my life \u2014 the immigrant aspect and the refugee aspect,\u201d Amash said in an interview Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we remain a welcoming country, that people feel they have the opportunity to come here and start a new life.\u201d\n\nAmash is one of six lawmakers of Arab descent suddenly thrust into the spotlight thanks to a heated national debate over Trump\u2019s executive order banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. But of the group\u2019s five Republicans, Amash is the only one who fully opposes Trump\u2019s order, despite widespread criticism of the policy and the way it has been applied to people from the Middle East.\n\nThe split points to a deepening division between GOP partisans eager to applaud Trump\u2019s actions and others who are debating whether and how to resist in the early days of the administration, when dissent could risk a public rebuke from the president.\n\nAmash, who opposed Trump throughout the 2016 campaign, said some Republicans secretly oppose the immigration order but fear the political consequences of expressing their views.\n\n\u201cA number of colleagues have privately told me, \u2018Thank you for what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 but they have difficulty then going on TV or in the press and saying the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with fear of the administration.\u201d\n\nThe most confused position has come from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who partly defended Trump on Monday during an interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say this was perfectly executed by any means and there has been some confusion, [but] I think we have to put it in perspective that it is temporary, that it does not target people per se based on religion,\u201d Issa said of the ban.\n\n\u201cThe president is trying to react to a crisis that has been ongoing for a period of time . . . I would rather deal with what the president\u2019s doing and make adjustments than to have a president that does nothing. We need to deal with a massive refugee problem.\u201d\n\nAsked Wednesday by The Washington Post whether his heritage affects his view, Issa was a bit more conciliatory.\n\n\u201cAs the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, of course this issue hits home,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cI was, frankly, pretty disappointed by the way this ban was rolled out, especially before even the administration really knew all the details. In our district, we\u2019ve been working on casework for two Iraqi interpreters who\u2019ve needed help securing visas . . . I\u2019d also say some of our local tech companies are confused and concerned about the impact that the ban will have on their employees.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order prompted chaos at U.S. airports, sparked widespread protests and drew a swift wave of legal challenges, plunging the nascent administration into chaos after only one full week in office. The policy affects an estimated 90,000 people, some of whom were barred from boarding flights or detained upon reaching the United States.\n\nAmash has become a forceful critic of the executive order, primarily on legal grounds. But he said his family\u2019s experience coming to the United States reinforces his opposition to Trump\u2019s policy.\n\n\u201cMy father became a refugee in 1948. They lived in [Ramallah, Palestine] until 1956 when a pastor and his wife from Muskegon, Michigan sponsored my dad\u2019s family to come to the United States. They arrived in New York City like a lot of immigrant families and started a new life here. Now, my parents have a son in Congress. It\u2019s really the American Dream,\u201d he said.\n\nHis parents are \u201cobviously very concerned\u201d about Trump\u2019s order, Amash said, adding: \u201cHistorically, our party has been welcoming to immigrants and refugees. My parents came here and became Republicans! They felt good about this country and felt good being Republicans.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham, who is one generation more removed from his Arab heritage, could not see the immigration issue more differently.\n\n\u201cI am behind Trump 100 percent on this,\u201d he said in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMy father was Lebanese \u2014 his parents actually came from Lebanon. He was, of course, born in the States. My mother was American, or non-Lebanese. So we have immigrants in our family, and I am very proud of that. But I come at the immigration issue as an American.\u201d\n\nAbraham, Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) and Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), all of Lebanese descent, support Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my heritage and appreciate the contributions of our forefathers, but the future greatness of the United States depends upon the safety and security of Americans today,\u201d Graves said in a statement Monday.\n\nLaHood, son of former GOP congressman and secretary of transportation Ray LaHood, said the travel ban \u201cshould be viewed as protecting our homeland and its citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity for those looking to immigrate to a better way of life, but first and foremost, national security for our American citizens and our homeland must be priority No. 1,\u201d he said in a statement Monday.\n\nNeither Graves nor LaHood agreed to be interviewed for this article.\n\n[\u2018Why let \u2018em in?\u2019 Understanding Bannon\u2019s worldview]\n\nAbraham, who just began his second term, aligned himself with this view in a video posted to Twitter on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s past time that we, President Trump, Congress, look out for the American people. President Trump is right when he says \u2018America first.\u2019 We must secure our borders. We must vet these immigrants that want to come here and do bad and nefarious things to us as American citizens,\u201d he said.told the camera.\n\nBut in Michigan\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Amash said his constituents have been harmed by the ban.\n\n\u201cIn some cases you have people who just went overseas for a funeral or for a birthday and they want to come back to the United States, and now they\u2019re in a difficult position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt affects people of all backgrounds, whether they\u2019re Jewish, Christian or Muslim.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
