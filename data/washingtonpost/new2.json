The move comes on the day the key portion of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, one that bars the issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries, was due to expire.\n\n\u201cAs president, I must act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people,\u201d Trump wrote in a proclamation announcing the changes for citizens from specific nations. On Twitter, he added: \u201cMaking America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s original travel ban, signed as an executive order in the first days of his presidency, was always meant to be a temporary measure while his administration crafted more permanent rules. A senior administration official cautioned that the new restrictions are not meant to last forever, but are \u201cnecessary and conditions-based, not time-based.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new travel ban represents the third version offered by the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court on June 26 decided to allow a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to be implemented. The court will also hold a hearing on the case in the fall. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThree nations were added to the list of countries whose citizens will face the restrictions: Chad, North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 although the restrictions on Venezuela are narrowly crafted, targeting that country\u2019s leaders and their family members.\n\nOne country, Sudan, fell off the travel ban list issued at the beginning of the year. Senior administration officials said a review of Sudan\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. government on national security and information-sharing showed it was appropriate to remove it from the list.\n\nThe new restrictions will be phased in over time, officials said, and the restrictions will not affect anyone who already holds a U.S. visa. For those visitors affected by the changed restrictions, the new rules will go into effect Oct. 18, according to the proclamation.\n\nThe new rules vary per country, barring entry into the United States of immigrants and nonimmigrants from Chad, Libya and Yemen, on business, tourist or business-tourist visas. It bars entry of Iranian citizens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, but provides an exception for Iranian students, provided they receive extra screening. The proclamation bars immigrants and nonimmigrants from North Korea and Syria. It bars immigration by citizens of Somalia.\n\nCritics of the administration have argued that the travel bans are an unconstitutional attempt to deliver on Trump\u2019s campaign promise of \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Administration officials deny that any of the bans were aimed at Muslims, saying they are based on security concerns about visitors from countries with failing or weak governments.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions either previously or now were never, ever ever based on race, religion or creed,\u2019\u2019 one senior administration official said. \u201cThose governments are simply not compliant with our basic security requirements.\u201d\n\nAnthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said adding North Korea and Venezuela to the administration\u2019s list does not fix the travel ban\u2019s core problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s original sin of targeting Muslims,\u201d he said, \u201ccannot be cured by throwing other countries onto his enemies list.\u201d\n\nThe original version, signed as an executive order in January, blocked citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria \u2014 as well as all refugees across the globe.\n\nWhen that measure was blocked in court, Trump signed a revised order removing Iraq from the banned list and only barring the issuance of visas to citizens of the six remaining countries and all refugees.\n\nThe second order, too, was blocked by judges, but the Supreme Court in June allowed it to go into effect with a significant caveat. The administration, the court said, could not block from entering the country those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as family members or those with firm offers of employment.\n\nThe ban on citizens of the six countries was to last 90 days; the ban on refugees was to last 120 days. The refu\u00adgee ban is set to expire Oct. 24, and it was not immediately clear what impact the new restrictions might have on it.\n\nThe Supreme Court has scheduled arguments for Oct. 10 on whether the measure, at its core, is legal. The Justice Department signaled Sunday night that the new rules could affect how the court handles the case \u2014 lawyers for the administration filed a letter asking for new court briefs to address issues raised by the new rules.\n\nIn explaining how the administration came to cite these eight countries, officials said many governments already met U.S. requests \u2014 using secure biometric passports, for example, and willingly passing along terrorism and criminal-history information. Others agreed to make changes and share more data. But some were either unable or unwilling to give the United States what it needed, officials said.\n\nThe president had signaled earlier this month that an expansion of the travel ban was likely. Citing an attack in London, Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific \u2014 but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u201d\n\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-09-24", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "restrictions", "visitors", "citizens", "ban", "expands", "restricting", "court", "united", "officials", "countries", "states", "house", "white", "administration"], "summary": "The Trump administration announced new restrictions Sunday on visitors from eight countries \u2014 an expansion of an existing travel ban that has spurred fierce legal debates over security, immigration and discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court on June 26 decided to allow a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to be implemented.\nOne country, Sudan, fell off the travel ban list issued at the beginning of the year.\nThe ban on citizens of the six countries was to last 90 days; the ban on refugees was to last 120 days.\nThe president had signaled earlier this month that an expansion of the travel ban was likely."}
