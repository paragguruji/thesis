Among them: George Conway, a prominent lawyer who is married to top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and nearly became a Trump appointee.\n\nQuoting one of the president\u2019s messages, George Conway wrote on his Twitter account that Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cmay make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad.\u201d\n\nOSG is an abbreviation for the Office of Solicitor General, and SCOTUS is an abbreviation for the Supreme Court. Conway\u2019s account is not verified, but he confirmed it was his in an email to The Washington Post.\n\n[Trump\u2019s latest tweets will likely hurt effort to restore travel ban]\n\nLast week, Conway had removed himself from consideration to head the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, which defends presidential policies from lawsuits. Lawyers in the division had actually been defending the president\u2019s travel bans, although as the legal wrangling reached the appeals courts, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall argued the cases in court.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nConway cited timing as the reason he could not take the job, and he said he was happy to have been considered.\n\n\u201cI am profoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General for selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice. I have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government,\u201d Conway said in a statement. \u201cKellyanne and I continue to support the President and his Administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government.\u201d\n\nKellyanne Conway is one of the Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, appearing on television frequently to tirelessly support the president\u2019s policies. She told Fox News Channel earlier this year that she thought the president\u2019s revised travel ban would \u201cpass legal muster,\u201d and on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Monday, she defended the order again, deriding what she called \u201cthis obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.\u201d She added later: \u201cThis president, through his travel ban, is trying to do something to protect the people of this country.\u201d\n\nGeorge Conway did not criticize the ban itself, instead focusing on the president\u2019s remarks as possibly hurting the case to restore it.\n\nLater, he added on Twitter: \u201cI still VERY, VERY STRONGLY support POTUS, his Admin, policies, the executive order and of course, my wonderful wife.\n\n\u201cWhich is why I said what I said this morning,\u201d he added. \u201cEvery sensible lawyer in WHCO and every political appointee at DOJ wd agree with me (as some have already told me). The pt cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS \u2014 and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it.\u201d\n\nFederal judges have consistently cited Trump\u2019s public comments in ordering the travel ban frozen, determining that his statements show that his intent in signing the directive was not to protect national security, but rather to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nThe ban is now headed to the Supreme Court, where those suing are expected to file legal briefs next week.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
