In 2018, 10 Democratic members of the Senate and 12 members of the House will face reelection campaigns in states or districts carried by the Republican president.\n\nYet as of Monday afternoon, no Democrat in either house of Congress had defended Trump\u2019s executive orders curtailing the refugee program and banning travel to the United States from seven largely Muslim countries. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), whose state broke for Trump by 42 points, has not commented on the executive order, but nearly every other Trump-state or Trump-district Democrat has condemned it.\n\n[Democrats will attempt to rescind Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nIn the House, the condemnations ranged in topic from the implementation of the executive order to its basic morality. Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), whose western Wisconsin district went for Trump after decades of support for Democrats, said in a statement that America \u201ccannot start discriminating based on religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of helping keep our country safe it will jeopardize our national security by giving ISIS and other terror groups another recruitment tool,\u201d Kind said of the order, \u201cand making it harder for our allies in Muslim nations to work with us on counterterrorism operations.\u201d\n\nRep. David Loebsack (D-Iowa), now the only Democratic member of Congress from Iowa, called the order a departure from American values that \u201cput Americans at risk and gives fodder to our enemies.\u201d\n\nRep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), whose Lehigh Valley district experienced one of the biggest swings from blue to red, used some of the same critical analysis. \u201cOur national devotion to religious freedom and tolerance is not Republican or Democratic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s American.\u201d\n\nRep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), one of three Minnesotans whose large rural seats flipped from blue to red, used his statement to defend the refugee-vetting program and accuse the president of religious discrimination.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a ban directed at Muslims \u2014 a clear violation of Constitutional protections against religious discrimination that rolls back our Nation\u2019s long, hard fought battle for greater inclusion,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), whose Upstate New York district broke narrowly for Trump, was among the Democrats saying the order simply made no sense.\n\n\u201cIf the president wants to keep out dangerous terrorists, I\u2019m all for it, but shutting out people for their faith and guys who risked their lives fighting with us in Iraq is clumsy and stupid and shows Trump is just winging it,\u201d said Maloney.\n\nAnd freshman Democrats whose districts got more blue in 2016 \u2014 but still voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton \u2014 focused both on the morality of the executive order and its impracticality.\n\n\u201cIt ignores our real national security needs and has created chaos at our nation\u2019s airports,\u201d said Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran (D-Ariz.).\n\n\u201cTwo of my constituents, who have been green cardholders for the last five years, and are in the process of applying for their citizenship, were detained for roughly eight hours in Chicago,\u201d said Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.). \u201cBoth are in wheelchairs, and one is legally blind. We can develop a better policy than this.\u201d\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), who like Rosen bucked the Republican tide and captured a seat for the Democrats, harked back to his own family\u2019s experience.\n\n\u201cLike many Americans, my family immigrated here not long ago; my wife\u2019s grandparents came to the United States after fleeing the Holocaust,\u201d Gottheimer said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve seen that a blanket ban on any people undermines our national character and risks making us less safe by turning people around the world against us.\u201d\n\nWhile many of these Democrats will appear on the GOP\u2019s 2018 target list, none was willing to endorse the Trump policy. By contrast, many of the 23 Republicans in districts that voted for Clinton put out statements criticizing the policy.\n\nEarly Monday afternoon, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released an early list of 35 districts they may target to take back control of the House. They included the 23 Clinton/Republican seats, 10 seats where the margin was close, and the soon-to-be open seats of Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). In a combative response memo, the National Republican Congressional Committee noted that in the 23 Clinton/Republican seats, the average member had been reelected by double digits.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts", "type": "article"}
