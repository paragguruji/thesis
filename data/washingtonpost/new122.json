(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nMiller also denounced the federal appeals court that ruled last week to keep the travel ban on hold, accusing it of ideological bias and saying the decision represents a \u201cusurpation of power\u201d by the judicial branch.\n\n\u201cIt is a violation of judges\u2019 proper roles in litigating disputes,\u201d Miller said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nAfter the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against reinstating President Trump's travel ban, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Feb. 12 defended the policy while Democratic senators continued to oppose it. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nThe harsh language not only echoes Trump\u2019s unusually strong criticism of the courts. It also suggests the White House considers itself on a collision course with the judicial branch over the limits of presidential power.\n\nAs for the travel ban, Miller said the White House is weighing what to do next. But whatever course it takes, there\u2019s no question about its intention toward the latest ruling.\n\n\u201cWe will fight it,\u201d Miller said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nMILLER REPEATS FALSE CLAIM OF VOTER FRAUD\n\nLike Trump himself, the president\u2019s aides cannot seem to let go of the false claim that voter fraud undermined their boss\u2019s performance in the election.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Miller said \u201cmassive voter fraud\u201d took place Nov. 8 and alluded to Trump\u2019s own belief, shared recently with senators, that thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to illegally vote there.\n\nThere is no evidence that this happened, nor that voter fraud took place on a wide scale, which ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos noted during the interview.\n\n\u201cFor the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence that the president\u2019s claim that he would have won the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn\u2019t voted \u2014 zero evidence for either one of those claims,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\nINSIDE TRUMP\u2019S INNER CIRCLE\n\nMiller, at 31, is one of the youngest and most powerful members of the White House staff. But he is not the only senior aide whose status in Trump\u2019s world is drawing attention.\n\nThe figure who is now the center of controversy is national security adviser Michael Flynn, who, according to interviews with nine current and former U.S. officials, discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador before Trump took office.\n\n\n\nMichael Flynn in the White House briefing room on Feb. 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAs our colleagues wrote, some officials interpreted this contact as an \u201cinappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve\u201d under Trump from sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. But more crucial to Flynn\u2019s future at the White House was this: He allowed other members of Trump\u2019s team, including Vice President Pence, to publicly deny that discussions of sanctions with the ambassador had taken place.\n\nWhite House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Feb. 12 declined to say if President Trump still trusts national security adviser Michael Flynn. Meanwhile, Democrats scolded Flynn after The Washington Post reported that Flynn discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. during the transition of power. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nFlynn called Pence on Friday in an apparent attempt to contain the fallout. On Sunday, Miller refused to comment on Flynn\u2019s status when asked on several Sunday television shows. It\u2019s unclear what the future holds for him.\n\nThe other top Trump aide facing questions about his future is Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff, after a longtime Trump friend took the dramatic step of publicly calling for his replacement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my view that Reince is the problem,\u201d Newsmax Media chief executive Christopher Ruddy told The Post. \u201cI think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff \u2014 and Donald trusted him \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head.\u201d\n\nRuddy said there are several sitting Cabinet secretaries who agree with him, but he declined to name them.\n\nIMMIGRATION RAIDS RAISE CONCERNS OF TRUMP CRACKDOWN\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump signed an executive order to crack down on the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. And last week, hundreds of those immigrants were arrested in a wave of raids by U.S. authorities across at least six states.\n\nThe details of Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement campaign are still coming into focus. But the predominantly daytime raids were enough to raise alarms among immigration advocates, who said the arrests swept up law-abiding people as well as those with criminal records, whom Trump is ostensibly targeting.\n\nAs our colleagues reported, immigration officials \u201cacknowledged that as a result of Trump\u2019s executive order, authorities had cast a wider net than they would have last year.\u201d It is unclear how many of the arrests would have taken place under former President Obama, who was aggressive in deporting undocumented immigrants but prioritized convicted criminals in his second term.\n\nTrump defended the raids on Sunday as the fulfillment of his promise to voters:\n\nThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed! \u2014 Donald J.
