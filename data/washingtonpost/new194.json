(Reuters/Carlos Barria)\n\nPresident Trump on Monday tried to dismiss public opinion surveys showing opposition to his travel ban as \u201cfake news,\u201d insisting that there is popular support for his executive order temporarily prohibiting the entry of all refugees as well as travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations.\n\nTrump tweeted at 7:01 a.m.: \u201cAny negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\u201d\n\nAny negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\n\nThe president followed that up six minutes later with a second tweet: \u201cI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\u201d\n\nI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\n\nThe context of Trump's second tweet is unclear, but it may have been aimed at the suggestion, advanced in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch last weekend, that chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon is as powerful as Trump \u2014 if not more so \u2014 in running the federal government.\n\nTrump sent his tweets from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where he has been spending the long weekend golfing and socializing with family and friends.\n\nThe president may have been reacting to commentary on cable news morning shows about polling showing a majority of Americans oppose the travel ban. For instance, MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d discussed a CNN/ORC poll, released last Friday, which shows 53 percent of Americans oppose the executive order and 47 percent support it.\n\nMeanwhile, the executive order has been frozen by a legal challenge.
