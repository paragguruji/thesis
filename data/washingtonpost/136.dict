The executive order halts all refugee entry for 120 days and for 90 days bans entry from seven countries. (Alexander Schippers/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nA backlash against President Trump\u2019s new immigration rules intensified Monday, threatening Washington\u2019s relationship with its main partner in battling the Islamic State as Iraq\u2019s parliament voted for a reciprocal ban on visas for Americans.\n\nThe Iraqi lawmakers\u2019 decision is subject to ratification by the government, but it underscores growing resentment over a U.S. executive order that imposed visa restrictions on Iraqis and the citizens of six other Muslim-majority nations.\n\nForeign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari issued a terse statement describing the ban as unreasonable, given that Iraq is sacrificing the \u201cblood of its sons\u201d in the front-line fight against the militant group. He urged the United States to reconsider.\n\nAbout 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq to train and assist Iraqi forces, which are close to pushing Islamic State militants out of Mosul, their last major urban stronghold in Iraq.\n\nGiven the two countries\u2019 close military cooperation, Trump\u2019s decision to impose visa restrictions has drawn particular ire in Iraq. Exacerbating that anger, many Iraqis hold the United States responsible for their lack of security because of its 2003 invasion.\n\nPeople protest the travel ban at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam on Jan. 29.

But many of those who are in the process of being resettled have been caught up in Trump\u2019s 90-day ban on visas and 120-day suspension of refugee entries, adding a new layer of uncertainty after years of arduous security vetting, medical checks and onerous paperwork.\n\n\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done for the Americans, entering battles side by side with them, now I\u2019m a terrorist in their eyes,\u201d said Salih al-Issawi, 30, who worked as an interpreter with the U.S. Marines in Fallujah between 2006 and 2011, when he applied for resettlement. \u201cThey are ungrateful and left me stuck here to die.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Issawi is still in Fallujah. He fled when the Islamic State took over in 2014, because an association with U.S. forces meant an effective death sentence. But after running out of money to pay rent in northern Iraq, he returned to the city after it was retaken last year. He said he is still at risk from Islamic State sleeper cells and is viewed with suspicion by neighbors.\n\n\u201cPeople still look at me as a spy,\u201d he said. He was in the final stages of the resettlement process when Trump signed his order. Now, he doubts he will ever be able to leave.\n\n\u201cI regret that I worked with them in the first place and risked my life and my family\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\n\n[Denied Entry: Stories of refugees, immigrants and travelers barred from the U.S.]\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s executive order is ostensibly meant to protect America\u2019s national security, some say it will have the opposite effect. The 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation \u2014 whose members include all seven nations hit by the travel ban \u2014 expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d Monday.\n\nIn a statement, the group said that \u201csuch selective and discriminatory acts will only serve to strengthen the radical narratives of extremists and will provide further fuel to the advocates of violence and terrorism.\u201d It urged the United States to \u201creconsider this blanket statement and maintain its moral obligation to provide leadership and hope at a time of great uncertainty and unrest in the world.\u201d\n\nIn Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia, the head of the 54-nation African Union predicted \u201cturbulent times\u201d for the continent because of Trump\u2019s action. Three African countries \u2014 Sudan, Libya and Somalia \u2014 were on the list, which also contains Iraq, Syria, Iran and Yemen.\n\nThe African Union chief, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told leaders meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that the \u201cvery country to which many of our people were taken as slaves during the transatlantic slave trade has now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries.\u201d\n\nIn Tokyo, a group of about 40 Americans protested near the U.S. Embassy against Trump\u2019s travel ban and his plan to build a wall on the Mexico border, waving signs declaring \u201cI stand with Muslims\u201d and \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all just despondent,\u201d said Jesse Glickstein, the American lawyer and grandson of Nazi concentration camp survivors who organized Tuesday\u2019s protest. \u201cWe all felt that we needed to speak up.\u201d\n\nRabbi David Kunin, head of the Jewish Community of Japan, held a sign saying \u201cNo Muslim Ban.\u201d \u201cThis ban is unconstitutional and it goes against all the values that the United States stands for, and people of all faiths need to stand up and say no to the Muslim ban, no to the wall, no to this kind of violence that stems from hate but also stems from fear,\u201d he said. \u201cFear won\u2019t build a better world, only love and peace will build a better world.\u201d\n\nIf they are implemented, retaliatory visa restrictions against Americans could affect thousands of contractors supporting U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nThe U.S. military relies heavily on contractors for logistical support and security for some installations. Nearly 4,000 contractors work for the Defense Department in Iraq. At least 2,035 of them are U.S. citizens. Thousands more support other U.S. government operations.\n\n[Trump stands by order: \u2018This is not a Muslim ban\u2019]\n\nGovernment officials from the semiautonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq have refused to comment on the ban, which also affects Iraqi Kurds. Trump has expressed support for the Kurds; he told the New York Times before November\u2019s election that he was a \u201cbig fan\u201d of their forces.\n\n\u201cWe, as Kurds, are fighting against terrorism, and the U.S. government is aware of that,\u201d said Saadi Ahmed Pira, head of the foreign relations office for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan political party. He said he did not view the executive order as a decision against Kurds, but he said it was too general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it will prevent terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think what prevents terrorism is cooperation after defeating terrorism militarily, by dealing with the sources of terrorism, in terms of ideology and finances.\u201d\n\nA grievance repeatedly cited by Iraqi officials is that Trump included Iraq in the ban but left out countries such as Saudi Arabia, whose nationals have been responsible for attacks on U.S. soil. Saudis made up the majority of the hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which were referenced in Trump\u2019s order.\n\nTrump has rejected all criticism, insisting the policy is essential to root out terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. \u201cStudy the world!\u201d\n\nSalim reported from Baghdad.
