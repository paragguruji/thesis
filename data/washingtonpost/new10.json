(Reuters)\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nThe Trump administration announced new restrictions Sunday on visitors from eight countries \u2014 an expansion of the pre-existing travel ban that has spurred fierce legal debates over security, immigration and discrimination. In announcing the new rules, officials said they are meant to be both tough and targeted. The move comes on the day the key portion of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, one which bars the issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries, was due to expire. \u2026 Three new nations were added to the list of countries whose citizens will face the restrictions: Chad, North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 although the restrictions on Venezuela are narrowly crafted, targeting that country\u2019s leadership and their family members. One country, Sudan, fell off the travel ban list issued at the beginning of the year. Senior administration officials said a review of Sudan\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. government on national security and information-sharing showed it was appropriate to remove them from the list. The new restrictions will be phased in over time, officials said, and the restrictions will not affect anyone who already holds a U.S. visa. For those visitors affected by the changed restrictions, the new rules will go into effect Oct. 18, according to the proclamation.\n\nThe new ban creates innumerable questions:\n\nWhat becomes of the case pending in the Supreme Court on President Trump\u2019s second version of the travel ban?\n\nWhat evidence has the administration compiled to justify these bans? (\u201cIn explaining how the administration came to single out these eight countries, officials said many governments already met U.S. requests \u2014 using secure biometric passports, for example, and willingly passing along terrorism and criminal-history information,\u201d The Post reported. \u201cOthers agreed to make changes and share more data. But some were either unable or unwilling to give the United States what it needed, officials said.\u201d It remains to be seen whether this is true.)\n\nWhat objective criteria were deployed, and how did six of the original majority-Muslim countries remain on the list?\n\nHow can the administration continue to justify restrictions on refugees \u201cindefinitely\u201d given the exacting nature of the vetting they undergo?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Afghanistan on the list?\n\nWhat exceptions are to be made, and how will they impact hospitals, universities and other institutions that bring people in from the banned nations?\n\nThe most significant takeaway from travel ban 3.0 is confirmation that the first two bans were shoddily constructed initiatives, which could not be justified on available data. They were, just as critics claimed, designed as blatantly political documents playing to Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim base.\n\nWill this ban last any longer than the last two, or is it also tainted by the president\u2019s racist appeals? The American Civil Liberties Union isn\u2019t buying the new iteration. \u201cSix of President Trump\u2019s targeted countries are Muslim. The fact that Trump has added North Korea \u2014 with few visitors to the US \u2014 and a few government officials from Venezuela doesn\u2019t obfuscate the real fact that the administration\u2019s order is still a Muslim ban,\u201d it said in a written statement. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s original sin of targeting Muslims cannot be cured by throwing other countries onto his enemies list.\u201d\n\nThe move highlights a truism about this administration: It is as incompetent as it is mendacious. Had it from the beginning exercised care, conducted an appropriate review and narrowly tailored its ban for legitimate national security interests, Trump might have garnered public support and gotten the stamp of approval from the courts. Now, however, he risks losing once again in the courts if for no other reason than his credibility is shot. His deep devotion to race-baiting calls into doubt even legitimate national security goals.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "restrictions", "previous", "administration", "visitors", "ban", "venezuela", "ludicrous", "officials", "trumps", "ones", "concedes", "countries", "president", "implicitly"], "summary": "President Trump expands new travel ban to restrict visitors from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad.\nThe move comes on the day the key portion of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, one which bars the issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries, was due to expire.\nOne country, Sudan, fell off the travel ban list issued at the beginning of the year.\nThe new ban creates innumerable questions:What becomes of the case pending in the Supreme Court on President Trump\u2019s second version of the travel ban?\nThe most significant takeaway from travel ban 3.0 is confirmation that the first two bans were shoddily constructed initiatives, which could not be justified on available data."}
