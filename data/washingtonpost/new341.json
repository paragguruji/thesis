Today he posted a story with this headline: \u201cEx-President Obama Made \u2018Surprise Visit\u2019 to Hawaii, Just Days Before Judge Issued Travel Ban Ruling.\u201d Though that headline seems tightly factual, it was filed under the banner of \u201cOPINION.\u201d\n\nBut:\n\n*What\u2019s so opinionated about pointing out that \u201cFormer President Barack Obama made a \u2018surprise visit\u2019 to Oahu this week, just days ahead of a controversial ruling on President Trump\u2019s new travel ban executive order issued by a Hawaiian judge.\u201d?\n\n*What\u2019s so opinionated about noting that this Hawaiian judge \u201cis a former Harvard classmate of President Obama who was appointed under his administration in 2012.\u201d?\n\n*What\u2019s so opinionated about writing this simple fact: \u201cAhead of the ruling, the president made the aforementioned \u2018surprise visit\u2019 to Oahu, Hawaii.\u201d?\n\n*And what\u2019s so opinionated about noting, just like a wire-service reporter, that \u201cOn Monday night, President Obama dined at upscale restaurant Noi Thai in Honolulu, Hawaii. The location of the restaurant was particularly interesting to Reddit users, who point out with verifiable information that it was within five minutes of the courthouse where the ruling was issued.\u201d?\n\nThere are all just boring, everyday facts. Why is the viral editor of the IJ Review doing such prosaic journalism?\n\nAnd what\u2019s with this crazy editor\u2019s note that is now appended to the story? Here it is: \u201cEditor\u2019s Note: This story has removed unnecessary speculation about the timing of the visit. We apologize for any undue conclusions that might have been drawn from the report.\u201d\n\nNo undue conclusions here! The Erik Wemple Blog never supposed that IJ Review was attempting anything other than coincidental journalism.\n\nIn light of this demonstrated ability to string together facts in compelling and viral ways, please check in on the work of the IJ Review as it covers the Asia trip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The State Department chose an IJ Review staffer as the sole reporter to travel on Tillerson\u2019s plane, the better to \u201cinclude a broader representation of U.S. media.\u201d That aim appears to be fulfilled.\n\nUPDATE: IJ Review has now retracted this innocent collection of facts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["ruling", "travel", "hawaii", "trump", "viral", "ij", "opinionated", "judge", "visit", "obama", "review", "president", "scoop", "surprise"], "summary": "*What\u2019s so opinionated about noting that this Hawaiian judge \u201cis a former Harvard classmate of President Obama who was appointed under his administration in 2012.\u201d?\n*What\u2019s so opinionated about writing this simple fact: \u201cAhead of the ruling, the president made the aforementioned \u2018surprise visit\u2019 to Oahu, Hawaii.\u201d?\nWhy is the viral editor of the IJ Review doing such prosaic journalism?\nThe Erik Wemple Blog never supposed that IJ Review was attempting anything other than coincidental journalism.\nUPDATE: IJ Review has now retracted this innocent collection of facts."}
