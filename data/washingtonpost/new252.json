Foreign-born scientists within the U.S. fear similar orders could be issued without warning, and some have expressed anxiety about deportation or losing family ties. Ultimately, the letter argues, the policy will harm patients and the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThough the ban from the Trump administration is aimed at seven countries, our global employees interpret the underlying message as, 'America is no longer welcoming of any immigrants, whatsoever,'\" wrote chief executives, venture capitalists, academic leaders and at least one Nobel Prize winner. \u201cIf this misguided policy is not reversed, America is at risk of losing its leadership position in one of its most important sectors, one that will shape the world in the twenty-first century.\u201d\n\nThe letter, a grass-roots effort organized late last week by a half dozen chief executives, comes in stark contrast to the tone that the leaders of major pharmaceutical companies set in a meeting last week with Trump. Pharmaceutical leaders came away from that meeting emphasizing the common ground they had with Trump on many issues. It was unclear whether the travel ban was discussed in the private portion of the meeting. However, in the run-up, the industry's major trade group did not take a position and the companies that did respond were often supportive of employees, but neutral.\n\n\u201cWhat this letter represents is the voice of the innovative, entrepreneurial biotechnology industry, which places basic human values ahead of economic gain,\u201d said Steven Holtzman, chief executive of Decibel Therapeutics, an early stage company developing drugs for hearing loss based in Cambridge.\n\n[Big pharma depends on immigrants. It kept quiet about Trump\u2019s travel ban.]\n\nBiotech is a relatively young industry born from the emerging understanding of genetic science in the 1970s, best known for complex, expensive drugs created by living organisms. As science has advanced, biotech has become an increasingly broad term for the research-driven, startup-heavy wing of the drug industry trying to turn cutting-edge science into new medicines. As the research and development pipelines of traditional drug companies have dried up, biotech has become increasingly important \u2014 economically and to the development of new medicines.\n\nAt the same time, the biotech industry has been heavily reliant on immigrants; 52 percent of the 69,000 biomedical researchers in the U.S. were born abroad, according to one study.\n\n\u201cWithout those immigrants, cancer treatment today would never be in the kind of position that it is today,\u201d Jeremy Levin, chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics, said. \u201cFor me, the core of innovation \u2014 the heart of innovation \u2014 resides in America. It resides here because of the borders that we\u2019ve opened to these scientists that have come from abroad; it resides here because of the tremendous capital and infrastructure we\u2019ve built.\u201d\n\nThe letter-writing effort began informally, when late last week half a dozen colleagues, including Holtzman and Levin, decided they needed to say something about Trump's executive order. They drafted the letter collectively and sent it out to colleagues over the weekend to see if any would sign on. It quickly went viral; they accumulated more than 160 signatures over 96 hours.\n\nHoltzman said his mother came to the United States from Cuba as a child and his father's family came to escape religious persecution. Neither of his parents graduated high school, and yet Holtzman has been involved in creating new medicines at six biotechnology companies. His current company, a year-old start-up, has about 40 employees \u2014 a quarter of whom are either first-generation or foreign born.\n\n\u201cCould such a story be told in Trump's America?\u201d Holtzman asked.\n\nLevin is both an immigrant and a refugee. His family was expelled from South Africa during apartheid when he was a child. He also feels that he knows the threat terrorism poses more personally than some. As the former chief executive of generic drug company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, he recalls touring a factory in Israel on the border while rockets were being fired by Hamas.\n\n\u201cI believe you hunt down and destroy terrorism,\u201d Levin said. \u201cI know it more than most people who are in my industry, because I experienced it.\u201d\n\nWhat the executives agree is that the executive order could have far-reaching effects on American business and on the health of sick people.\n\n\u201cIt will harm an industry dominated by smaller companies and start-ups, the very kind of industry the administration has said it wants to support,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt will slow the fight against the many diseases that afflict us, as well as carry negative economic consequences for the United States.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nApple, Facebook, many other tech firms call travel ban \u2018unlawful\u2019 in rare coordinated legal action\n\n51 Nobel laureates, tens of thousands of academics sign protest of Trump immigration order\n\nHow Trump\u2019s travel ban could hurt science", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["executive", "america", "industry", "companies", "travel", "trump", "ban", "american", "trumps", "chief", "looks", "enraged", "letter"], "summary": "It was unclear whether the travel ban was discussed in the private portion of the meeting.\nIt kept quiet about Trump\u2019s travel ban.]\n\u201cWithout those immigrants, cancer treatment today would never be in the kind of position that it is today,\u201d Jeremy Levin, chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics, said.\n\u201cCould such a story be told in Trump's America?\u201d Holtzman asked.\n\u201cIt will harm an industry dominated by smaller companies and start-ups, the very kind of industry the administration has said it wants to support,\u201d the letter states."}
