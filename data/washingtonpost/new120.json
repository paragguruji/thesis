(John Angelillo/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nFormer president George W. Bush rarely weighs in on current political events, but on Monday, he offered some of his most pointed critiques of President Trump's statements and policies in an interview with NBC News' \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nAsked about Trump's claim that the media is the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d Bush warned that an independent press is essential to democracy and that denouncing the press at home makes it difficult for the United States to preach democratic values abroad.\n\n\u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\n\n\u201cPower can be very addictive and it can be corrosive and it's important for the media to call to account people who abuse power, whether it be here or elsewhere,\u201d he added.\n\nBush noted that during his presidency, he sought to persuade people like Russian President Vladimir Putin to respect a free press.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press when we're not willing to have one ourselves,\u201d Bush said.\n\nOn Russia, Bush added that \u201cwe all need answers\u201d about whether Trump campaign officials had contact with Russian officials in the election. But he did not endorse the idea that an independent prosecutor was necessary. Bush said that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr was an \u201cindependent thinker\u201d capable of handling the inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf he were to recommend a special prosecutor, then it'd have a lot more credibility with me,\u201d Bush said of Burr.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on Feb. 26 reacted to comments by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that a special prosecutor should investigate apparent Russian meddling in the 2016 election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nBush's interview was pegged to the release of his new book of oil paintings of wounded veterans. But the former president seemed unusually willing to offer criticism of the sitting president from his own party, a departure from his longtime practice of staying out of the fray.\n\nBush even chuckled as host Matt Lauer reminded him of Trump's colorful description of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d during his inaugural address, which Bush attended.\n\nLauer sought to pin Bush down on his position on Trump's travel ban, which Bush refused to endorse.\n\nInstead, he offered a defense of religious freedom, warning that the terror threat is not a religious war but an ideological one.\n\n\u201cI think it's very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or to not worship at all,\u201d Bush said. \u201cA bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understood right off the bat that this was an ideological conflict and people who murder the innocent are not religious people \u2014 they want to advance an ideology and we have faced those kinds of ideologues in the past,\u201d he added.\n\nPressed to state clearly whether he supports or opposes the ban, Bush would only say \u201cI am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["critiques", "travel", "trump", "george", "ban", "worship", "free", "prosecutor", "trumps", "media", "religious", "press", "w", "president", "russian", "independent", "bush"], "summary": "Former president George W.
