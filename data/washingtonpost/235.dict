But Judge Leonie M. Brinkema\u2019s opinion could have much broader implications for the fight against the ban.\n\nBrinkema was the first judge in the country to actually confront the legality of the executive order barring travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nWhile a temporary restraining order out of Washington state put the ban on hold nationwide, the judge who issued that ruling did not delve deeply into the facts of the case. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said much in its decision about Trump\u2019s motives and the separation of powers. But, ultimately, that panel ruled on narrow due process grounds. Its opinion did not even mention the statute on which the executive order is based, which gives the president broad power over immigration and national security.\n\nBrinkema addresses that statute, as well as the record of Trump\u2019s comments and the case law to justify their inclusion.\n\n\u201cJudge Brinkema spells out a lot more; she really fleshes out one of the possible claims, and that\u2019s the religious discrimination claim,\u201d said David Martin, a professor at the University of Virginia who, for many years, helped shape immigration policy inside the government. \u201cThat may well prove to be the strongest or more fruitful line of inquiry for the plaintiffs in these various cases, particularly if they\u2019re trying to reach past green-card holders or people on immigrant visas. It\u2019s hard to get there without a religious discrimination case of some kind.\u201d\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nGreen-card holders and people with long-term immigrant visas have certain rights that visitors, students and others do not. But if the executive order is deemed unconstitutional on religious discrimination grounds, those distinctions are irrelevant.\n\nWhile one federal judge\u2019s decision is not binding on any other court, experts agreed that Brinkema\u2019s thoroughness will probably make her opinion persuasive to other districts.\n\n\u201cIt was a very well-reasoned, thoughtful decision. Frankly, I think, a more careful decision than the 9th Circuit decision,\u201d said Steve Legomsky, former chief counsel for immigration services in the Department of Homeland Security. In her opinion, Legomsky said, Brinkema \u201c pretty methodically went through the various statements by Trump. . . . They put great weight on the opinions of the former national security officials to show the absence of counterevidence from the Trump administration. For both of those reasons, I think the Virginia opinion is very important.\u201d\n\nBrinkema also brings to the case extensive national security experience. She presided over the trial of Sept. 11, 2001, conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, among other high-profile cases.\n\n\u201cIt was a thoughtful opinion, it\u2019s well considered, it wasn\u2019t hastily done like some of these other decisions had to be in light of circumstances,\u201d said Justin Cox of the National Immigration Law Center. His group is involved in several lawsuits against the ban, including one filed in Maryland last week focused on refugees. That case is specifically focused on religious discrimination.\n\n\u201cLegally [the Virginia ruling] is actually quite significant because it\u2019s the first court to squarely hold that the executive order violates the establishment clause,\u201d Cox said.\n\nThe danger for opponents of the ban is that, should the Justice Department appeal Brinkema\u2019s decision, they will face the more conservative 4th Circuit rather than the left-leaning 9th Circuit.\n\n\u201cIt would be a close call,\u201d Legomsky said. \u201cThere is such strong evidence of religious discrimination \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to know.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-14", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "type": "article"}
