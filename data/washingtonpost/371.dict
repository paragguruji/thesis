(John Raoux/AP)\n\nOn Monday morning, I woke up to the news that innocent people had been killed in another senseless mass shooting. At least 50 people had been killed after a gunman opened fire on thousands attending a country music festival in Las Vegas. And before I could feel fear, grief or despair, I felt relief that the killer was white.\n\nThe vast majority of mass shootings in this country are committed by white men, yet the stereotype of the angry, violent white male has virtually no pull on the social standing or political power of the white male collective. Disgruntled white men are almost unanimously recognized as the face of maniacs killing at random, yet whenever there\u2019s a new tragedy, it\u2019s we black and brown people who rush frantically to Google, hoping the shooter doesn\u2019t look like us.\n\nAfter the news broke, I, along with millions of other black folks and people of color, felt that all-too-familiar anxiety. It\u2019s a discomfort white people have no real frame of reference for, making it easy for them to write it off as racial paranoia. But it\u2019s real for us who fit outside the default for cultural and social normalcy. If a white person commits a crime, no one suggests that white people in general are criminally inclined, or that the crime says something larger about whiteness. Obviously, the same cannot be said for black people.\n\nOur relief that we don\u2019t resemble the killer comes with feelings of conflict and guilt: People are dead and families are devastated. I doubt many people of color were celebrating and high-fiving each other because we didn\u2019t look like the bad guy. But I know that if the shooter had been black, the national conversation would somehow \u201cstraw-man\u201d its way into being about Black Lives Matter and black criminality. God help us if it had happened at a rap concert. \u201cBlack-on-black crime\u201d would\u2019ve been on the tongues of every demagogue blowhard with a platform, and black athletes wouldn\u2019t be able to kneel in protest of police brutality again without having a massacre thrown in their faces. (In fact, Fox News managed to get in a swipe at black NFL players anyway.)\n\nIf he had been Hispanic, it would be the reason \u201cwe can\u2019t let these people in our country.\u201d Whether he was actually an illegal immigrant would\u2019ve been obfuscated into irrelevancy within the first day of reporting, as pundits bleated about massive deportation and building walls (logistics not included).\n\nMembers of The Washington Post Editorial Board appeal to President Trump and Congress to stand up to the gun lobby. It takes moral courage, they say, to back gun-control legislation and prevent mass shootings. (Adriana Usero,Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post)\n\nIf the shooter was Middle Eastern or Muslim, the rhetoric would pretty much write itself at this point. President Trump could add half the Middle East to his travel ban list and justify it through 24-hour news coverage of fleeing survivors. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the killer was a U.S. citizen, born and raised in Vegas or if there were no ties found to any known terrorist organization. I doubt he\u2019d be granted a descriptor with a positive connotation like \u201clone wolf,\u201d as if he were the protagonist in a classic Western; I doubt any editor would find that term appropriate.\n\n[Why I boycotted Congress\u2019s latest empty moment of silence for gun victims]\n\nBut white people don\u2019t need to fear their movements for justice being undermined or the whole of their demographic feeling the pressure to answer for the crimes of a few. They may have to endure a couple weeks of anti-white nationalist think pieces (which they\u2019re free to ignore) showing up in their news feeds when someone gets killed at a Nazi rally, but their very existence will never be viewed as a threat. They don\u2019t rush to their search engines after breaking news of a mass killing to make sure the assailant isn\u2019t white. And when he so often is, they face no persecution as a result.\n\nEven the fact that so many news outlets are calling what happened in Las Vegas \u201cthe deadliest shooting in U.S. history\u201d goes to show how much race is embedded in our responses to crime. These outlets overlook the deadliest massacres in this country\u2019s history, which all involved black victims: the havoc brought down in Tulsa in 1921 (300 murdered by a white mob); in Phillips County, Ark., in 1919 (an estimated 100-237 lynched); in Colfax, La., (150 killed); and many more atrocities where black victims were slaughtered by white psychopaths.\n\n[It\u2019s time to stop arguing about racism with white people]\n\nEven immortalizing the Vegas shooting by naming it the deadliest we\u2019ve ever seen won\u2019t stop white terrorism from being treated as more than anecdotal and isolated. If the shootings at Sandy Hook and Charleston have shown us anything, it\u2019s that even the most heinous crimes imaginable, when committed by members of the white majority, don\u2019t inspire much of a lasting sense of urgency. We don\u2019t militarize airports and ban entire populations from U.S. entry the way we do after even a whiff of \u201cIslamic terrorism.\u201d We don\u2019t enact preventive measures. We don\u2019t seem to do much at all.\n\nWhat I know is that on Monday, I found out that innocent people died, and I felt relief. It didn\u2019t feel good, but I felt free in the way the white majority \u2014 the default \u2014 gets to feel naturally, regardless of what color the shooter is.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s always about race. Even when it\u2019s not.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-10-05", "type": "article"}
