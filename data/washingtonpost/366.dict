(Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump's last-minute intervention allowed an all-girl robotics team from Afghanistan to come to the United States. More important, it enabled the high schoolers to achieve what few female Afghans are able to: represent their country on an international stage.\n\n\u201cI feel so happy that I can\u2019t describe in words,\u201d team member Fatemah Qaderyan told The Post at Washington Dulles International Airport Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe felt so disappointed (when we were denied visa) because our team members had worked very hard for six months,\u201d the 14-year-old added.\n\nTrump's involvement drew praise from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who said in a tweet Saturday morning that while others talk, the president acts. But critics pointed out that selectively allowing a small group of people to come to the United States, while denying many others, is not deserving of credit.\n\nThank you, @POTUS, for helping these girls. Others talk (and talk and talk). You act. https://t.co/2ea6bdWjCk \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) July 15, 2017\n\nIn response to Conway's tweet, Paul Musgrave, an international relations expert who teaches political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said, \u201cSelective enforcement of laws and displays of 'mercy' are monarchical, not democratic, tendencies.\u201d\n\nJust a reminder: selective enforcement of laws and displays of \"mercy\" are monarchical, not democratic, tendencies https://t.co/2Dt5GsJ8SD \u2014 Paul Musgrave (@profmusgrave) July 15, 2017\n\nHe told The Washington Post that while Trump did the right thing, \u201cmaking an exception here and there for people who are particularly charismatic and particularly visible\u201d is indicative of an administration that takes action because popular opinion, not rational policy, necessitates doing so.\n\n\u201cThink about all the other charismatic groups that we haven't had this kind of mobilization about. Conway's tweet is in this vein of the good president saving innocent people from the government. Well, if he cares that much about these young women, what is he doing to make sure that we have a just process in place for all the many thousands of people affected by his other policies?\u201d Musgrave said, referring to the Trump administration's travel ban, which places restrictions on people from six predominantly Muslim countries. Afghanistan is not among those countries.\n\nConway is traveling and is unavailable to comment, her chief of staff said.\n\nThe story of the high school girls from the city of Herat in western Afghanistan \u2014 and their uphill battle in trying to come to the United States \u2014 first attracted worldwide sympathy a few weeks ago.\n\nThe Afghan girls' robotic team will be allowed to travel to the United States to participate in an international robotics competition after their visa applications were denied twice. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)\n\nThey scrambled for months to build a ball-sorting robot that will compete in the FIRST Global Challenge, an international robotics competition in Washington. The team was supposed to receive equipment from the United States, but it was held up for months amid terrorism concerns. So the team members improvised and built motorized machines out of household materials, The Post reported.\n\nTo be able to come to the United States, they twice made the dangerous 500-mile journey to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to apply for their visas.\n\n[U.S. denies visas for Afghanistan\u2019s all-girl robotics team]\n\nBut their applications were denied.\n\nThe hurdles \u2014 punctuated by the fact that nearly all teams, including those from countries barred under Trump's travel ban, were allowed to come \u2014 drew criticism from human rights activists and questions about whether U.S. agencies were pulling back efforts to advocate for young women in Afghanistan, The Post reported.\n\n\u201cToday, many Afghan women feel betrayed. The Trump administration is formulating a new Afghanistan strategy, but the talk is all about troop numbers, not school books \u2014 and certainly not girls,\u201d Heather Barr, senior researcher for the Human Rights Watch's women's rights division, wrote last week.\n\nOn Wednesday, days before the competition was scheduled to start, Politico broke the news of Trump's intervention. The Department of Homeland Security had granted the Afghan team members and their chaperon a \u201cparole,\u201d which allows them a one-time, temporary entry into the country for humanitarian reasons or \u201csignificant public benefit,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nI look forward to welcoming this brilliant team of Afghan girls, and their competitors, to Washington DC next week! #WomenInSTEM https://t.co/01qDduyglS \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) July 12, 2017\n\nThe reason the girls' visas were initially denied is unclear.\n\nThe State Department has cited privacy laws in declining to explain the decision. A spokesman told the Associated Press this week that visa applications are \u201cadjudicated on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nCritics on Twitter pointed to the administration's travel ban, saying it's the reason the team was barred in the first place and suggesting that the president shouldn't take credit for reversing the consequences of his own policies.\n\nThe audacity: White House wants credit for intervening to help girls that had difficulty entering country because of Trump's own Muslim Ban! https://t.co/GsJQLyejGm \u2014 Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) July 15, 2017\n\nBut the ban is not the reason the girls' visas were denied. The latest version of the ban affects Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 three of which have robotics teams that weren't blocked from coming to the United States. Another team, from Gambia, Africa, also was previously denied but has since been granted visas.\n\nOthers defended Trump and questioned why critics weren't as outraged when the African team's visas were denied.\n\nActually no, issues with their visa kept them from entering the country. They were never banned from entering. Trump stepped in and helped. \u2014 Robert M. Depo (@Big_Deepz) July 15, 2017\n\nBut the ban didn't apply to them and why not same outrage when African team was denied their visa? \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) July 15, 2017\n\nMusgrave said tying the travel ban to the Afghan team's difficulty in entering the country is a misplaced criticism and is probably because of confusion over the administration's policies on Muslim countries.\n\nStill, he maintains there's a connection \u2014 at least indirectly.\n\nAlthough Afghanistan is not among the restricted countries, the obstacles the team faced in coming to the United States are \u201creflective of the kind of policy errors you get from the administration that imposes the travel ban,\u201d Musgrave said. Praising the president for intervening is akin to \u201csnatching victory from the jaws of your defeat,\u201d he added.\n\n[Afghan girls team can travel to U.S. for robotics contest after being denied visas twice]\n\n\u201cIt wasn't a surprise to anybody that a team like this one coming from a country like Afghanistan would be caught up in this,\u201d Musgrave said, adding later: \u201cYou don't get credit for cleaning this up when you foster this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\n\nHad the girls not been allowed to come to the United States, they would've had to participate in the competition via Skype.\n\nThey landed at Washington Dulles International Airport early Saturday. The three-day robotics competition, which involves participants from nearly 160 countries, starts Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe six members of the Afghan robotics team, their mentor and Afghan ambassador's wife, Lael Mohib, pose for a photo at Dulles International Airport. (Shariff Hassan/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cSeventeen years ago, this would not have been possible at all. They represent our aspirations and resilience despite having been brought up in perpetual conflict. These girls will be proving to the world and the nation that nothing will prevent us from being an equal and active member of the international community,\u201d Afghan Ambassador Hamdullah Mohib told the AP after the girls arrived.\n\nSharif Hassan, Amanda Erickson, and Derek Hawkins contributed to this report.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAfghan girls robotics team arrives in U.S. just in time\n\nTravel ban takes effect as State Department defines \u2018close family\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s one way to help women in science: Support international collaborations", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-07-15", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/kristineaguerra", "type": "article"}
