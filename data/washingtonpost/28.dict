Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nYet another morning, yet another instance of President Trump's Twitter account undermining his own administration.\n\nThis time, the four tweets he sent early Monday morning could actually make one of Trump's top priorities much more difficult to see to fruition: Getting his travel ban reinstated by the Supreme Court, which the Trump administration has asked the court to do sooner rather than later.\n\nHow? Let's take the president's four travel ban tweets one by one.\n\nPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nThis is the first of several times in Trump's series of tweets that he's going to call into question courts' judgment and authority. It's something Trump does almost every time a court rules against one of his initiatives, and it's a practice that even the person he picked for Supreme Court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, said was \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch said an attack from anyone - including the president - on the motives of the federal judiciary is \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" (Video: Reuters)\n\nCourts are made up of people, too, and some legal scholars think that in antagonizing them, Trump risks inviting even more legal scrutiny on the intentions of his ban.\n\n\u201cThe justices will likely feel an instinct to protect their institution,\u201d said Austin Evers, director of the government corruption watchdog group, American Oversight, and a former top State Department lawyer. \u201cAnd to assert their coequal role in upholding the Constitution.\u201d\n\nNext problem with this tweet: the word \u201cban.\u201d It's been used by Trump's campaign and associates immediately following the word \u201cMuslim.\u201d When he was campaigning, Trump proposed a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country.\" As recently as February, Trump's \u201cstatement on preventing Muslim immigration\u201d was still on his campaign website. (It's since been taken down.)\n\nTop Trump officials, like press secretary Sean Spicer and counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, have repeatedly asserted Trump's travel executive orders are not a \u201cban,\u201d because they know the word draws connections to Trump's religion-focused rhetoric on the campaign trail. But here the president is using it, in all caps no less.\n\nOkay, next tweet.\n\nThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nCentral to travel ban opponents' legal arguments is that Trump is trying to ban Muslims from the country, which most courts would agree is a discriminatory policy that violates the Constitution's freedom of religion.\n\nNo court has actually decided on whether Trump's ban is discriminatory. Judges have looked at whether there's a reasonable legal argument to pause it while the discriminatory question gets worked out; most decided there is reason to pause it.\n\nBut when it comes to questioning the ban's intent, several courts, including two of the highest courts short of the Supreme Court, have said Trump's words are fair game for the other side to use as evidence.\n\nThat, ostensibly, means his tweets, too. And there, Trump's words and his policies don't always match up.\n\nLet's take these tweets. The travel executive order Trump signed \u2014 especially the second one \u2014 called for temporary travel restrictions for some people from six Muslim-majority countries, not a total travel ban.\n\nAs for implying this travel ban is too \u201cpolitically correct?\u201d Evers said it will be up to the courts to decide what Trump meant by that. If Trump is concerned his executive order is too \"politically correct,\" then where does he fall on religious discrimination? Given all Trump's campaign rhetoric, Evers said it's a fair question.\n\n[Trump's old tweets are becoming a minefield of hypocrisy]\n\nThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\n\"& seek a much tougher version\u201d \u2014 see above for why that's problematic. Even the White House tacitly acknowledged the first version of Trump's travel ban went too far (at one point, it seemed as if green-card holders from seven majority-Muslim countries weren't allowed into the United States) when it drafted a second one rather than fight the first's court battle.\n\nBut Trump is distancing himself from the lawyers who will be arguing on his behalf. He seems to disagree with his own Justice Department's legal strategy \u2014 and the actual travel ban that they are arguing for. (A travel ban that has Trump's signature on it, BTW.)\n\nFrom there, it's fair game for justices to ask whether Trump's lawyers are really representing the president.\n\n\u201cI think he is kneecapping his lawyers in the Department of Justice,\u201d Evers said.\n\nThis war of words between Trump and his administration has played out before.\n\nIn May, Trump fired his FBI director, then completely undermined his administration's arguments for why. (Vice President Pence and others said it was because of James B. Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation; Trump said it was \u201cthat Russia thing.\")\n\nAt one point, a reporter asked deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders whether journalists can even trust the information from White House press briefings anymore, given nearly everything they said about Comey's firing was undercut the next day by the president.\n\nIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nHere we have yet another direct shot at the courts. And yet another opportunity for the courts to exert their independence from a president who seems intent at chipping away at it.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/amber.j.phillps", "type": "article"}
