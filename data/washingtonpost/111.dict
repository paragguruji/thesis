She has worked extensively with Muslim communities in the United States, as well as refugees stranded abroad.\n\nThe Supreme Court on June 26 decided to allow a limited version of President Trump's travel ban to be implemented. The court will also hold a hearing on the case in the fall. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the days after President Trump issued his travel ban in late January, lawyers became a bit like superheroes. I was among the many attorneys working at San Francisco International Airport in the wake of the executive order that was widely known as the \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d and I recall the moment the crowd began cheering the attorneys on call, hailing us as saviors. While the good will was generous, it also seemed to foreshadow a dangerous tendency to rely on the courts and lawyers to act as a balance to our new administration\u2019s executive power.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision granting a stay and certiorari on Monday has confirmed exactly that fear. The court reinstated significant portions of the ban after several appeals courts had blocked it. Significantly, it was also a per curiam decision, issued on behalf of the full court \u2014 meaning that the justices usually considered bastions of the left partook in its holding and its underlying logic.\n\nThe logic of this decision turns fundamental premises of refugee law, immigration law and the international system on their heads and enables the administration\u2019s continued path toward isolationism. Ultimately, the order confirms that the fate of the nation cannot be left in the hands of the courts, and we cannot rely solely on lawyers to resist the worst impulses of the Trump administration. While lawyers are important allies, the dangers of entrusting us with the pushback against executive overreach \u2014 as the liberal camp began to do almost instantly after Trump issued the original executive order \u2014 are now evident.\n\n[Refugees are already vigorously vetted. I know because I vetted them.]\n\nThe Supreme Court reinstated significant portions of the ban but excluded its application to \u201cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d Attempting to ground its holding in specific examples, the court notes that those with families, education or employment opportunities in the United States may be able to show a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship and circumvent the ban. Those without such ties are subject to it.\n\nThe courts will certainly be the first place where arguments to define the contours of a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship play out. For instance, many refugees arguably have requisite \u201cties\u201d under this definition, through their relationships with U.S.-based refugee institutions.\n\nBut under any definition, the language reveals a move toward U.S. isolationism and unilateralism, and away from a fundamental principle of the international legal system. The premise of refugee law and asylum law is that we should be taking in precisely those people who may lack the \u201cbona fides\u201d laid out by the court. Those who are least connected, and therefore arguably most vulnerable: A pillar of international cooperation is the idea that people fleeing violence and persecution, and whose states have failed to protect them, can seek refuge in other states and will have their cases examined based on the danger they face and independent of any prior relationships. We expect the same in return.\n\nAs someone who has worked with refugees stranded overseas in abhorrent conditions, I find such language alarming. The fashioning of a novel distinction between \u201cbona fide ties\u201d and \u201cnon-bona fide ties\u201d from the nation\u2019s highest court reflects a disregard of the fundamentals of the refugee protection system, and at best a misunderstanding of the dreams and aspirations of those seeking relief through our immigration system. The young refugees I meet with stranded in refugee camps are not solely seeking to move to a place where they have a job or a relative. They are seeking safety, wherever they might find it. That is the sentiment that was at the heart of the \u201cLet Them In\u201d chants at airport terminals across the country earlier this year.\n\n[I risked my life for the U.S. Army in Iraq. But when I came here, I was nearly sent back.]\n\nMonday\u2019s setback in the court shows that lawyers cannot do this alone. U.S. history and other present-day struggles support skepticism of the vindication of rights solely through the judicial system. Even landmark civil rights cases \u2014 whether Roe v. Wade or Brown v. Board of Education \u2014 were preceded by significant organizing and mobilization. Victories in the Supreme Court (and in lower courts) reflected their times, cementing hard-earned popular progress only after the political ground had already begun to shift.\n\nLiberal commentators are already finding comfort in the promise of further review by the Supreme Court, or the potential that the case might be mooted out. Such optimism, even if technically warranted, misses the broader point. We must renew popular and political interest in pushing back against the executive order \u2014 and the many iterations that could follow, including other forms of discriminatory immigration profiling \u2014 in more sustained, nonlegal ways. The glorification of lawyers and the courts that took place in the immediate aftermath of the ban was misguided. This mistaken response was prominent among protesters, academics, journalists and perhaps most predictably, lawyers. And as the struggle moved from the streets and airport terminals to the courts, politicians stopped paying attention. In enabling them to look away, we have done a disservice to those we seek to help, and more importantly to a nation whose path we seek to correct.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban is useless.
