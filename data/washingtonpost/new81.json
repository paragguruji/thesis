Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday agreed to let a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban take effect, so we are republishing an updated version of this story.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning travelers from six Muslim-majority nations due to \u201cheightened concerns about terrorism\u201d was quickly frozen by the courts, much like an earlier version of the ban, until the Supreme Court acted on Monday.\n\nThe justices said they would let the ban partially take effect and, in the ruling, announced plans to consider the case later this year. The Supreme Court made a key exception, saying the ban could not be \u201cenforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d But otherwise, the Trump administration is now free to impose a 90-day ban on travelers from six countries that it had said posed certain \u201cnational security risks.\u201d\n\n[Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall]\n\nThe second travel ban had something big in common with the first version: It would not have kept out of the United States anyone responsible for a deadly terrorist attack since 2001.\n\nThere have been 10 fatal attacks in the United States tied to Islamist extremist ideology or otherwise deemed international terrorism since 2001. None of the people behind any of those attacks are from the banned countries (Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen; Iraq was included in the first ban but dropped for the second version).\n\nThere is a different pattern to be seen in deadly attacks since 2001. Since Sept. 11, 2001, every deadly Islamist militant attack inside the United States was carried out by a U.S. citizen or legal resident, according to data collected by New America, a Washington-based nonprofit group.\n\nThe group issued a report determining that the danger had been posed by people here at home, rather than those looking to sneak into the country.\n\n\u201cFar from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of Islamist militant terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents,\u201d the group said.\n\nIn arguing for the travel ban, Trump and his aides repeatedly said it was needed for national security reasons, pointing to the specter of past attacks as well as the threat of future ones to justify the order.\n\nHowever, in doing so, the Trump administration has also repeatedly invoked attacks that the ban would not have prevented had it been in place.\n\nAfter the first ban was signed, Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, went on television and defended it by pointing to incidents like the Sept. 11 attack, the Boston Marathon bombing or the mass shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nThis line of argument did not end when the first ban was halted in court and Trump officials began working up a new order. During Trump\u2019s first address to Congress, the president alluded to the upcoming second ban and also pointed to San Bernardino, the Boston Marathon and Sept. 11 as reasons \u201cimproved vetting procedures\u201d are needed.\n\n[Revised executive order bans travelers from six Muslim-majority countries from getting new visas]\n\nThese claims do not hold up. None of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from banned countries (most were from Saudi Arabia, while the rest were from Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates).\n\nThe two more recent mass shootings cited both involved people born in the United States. Omar Mateen, the Orlando gunman, was born in New York, the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan, a country not among those banned.\n\nIn San Bernardino, Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers, was born in Illinois. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, who came to the United States on a fiance visa, was born in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia, two countries not covered by the ban. According to the FBI, Farook had been radicalized and plotting attacks years before he met her.\n\n\n\nProtesters demonstrate in Richmond last month as a federal appeals court examined the travel ban. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombers \u2014 Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \u2014 were brothers born in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Dzhokhar, the younger of the two, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Several news outlets and politicians incorrectly reported that their parents were refugees; they instead came to the United States on travel visas and applied for political asylum.\n\nIn addition to Saudi Arabia, the ban also left out other countries that did have connections to extremist attackers or plots. Pakistan \u2014 birthplace of Faisal Shahzad, the attempted Times Square bomber, and Najibullah Zazi, a man who plotted to bomb New York\u2019s subway system \u2014 was not included. Neither was Kuwait, birthplace of Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, the gunman who killed four Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\n[Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented]\n\nTrump\u2019s second ban also included a suspension of refugee resettlement, arguing that \u201cmore than 300\u2033 people who came into the country as refugees are the subjects of FBI counterterrorism probes. The Supreme Court\u2019s actions Monday mean that the administration can also impose a 120-ban on refugees entering the United States, except those covered by the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d exception.\u201d\n\nRefugees from the countries included in Trump\u2019s ban weren\u2019t responsible for any attacks in the United States between 1975 and 2015, according to a report published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nThe report examined 154 people described as foreign-born terrorists who carried out attacks during that period; 20 were found to be refugees, and the only three who successfully carried out deadly attacks were Cubans admitted before the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nThat report came before Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a refugee from Somalia, drove his car into a crowd on the Ohio State University campus late last year and injured 11 people before being fatally shot by a police officer. The FBI has said Artan might have been inspired by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack. (The chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee later alleged Artan should have received more thorough vetting when his family was seeking refu\u00adgee status in the United States years earlier.)\n\n[What Trump changed in the new travel ban]\n\nThe text of Trump\u2019s new order went on to argue that the danger is posed not only from those who carried out successful attacks, but also those who were convicted of terrorism-related crimes and may have plotted attacks.\n\n\u201cRecent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security,\u201d the order states. \u201cSince 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States.\u201d\n\nIt offers two examples for this, one of which involves refugees from a country \u2014 Iraq \u2014 that was on the overall ban list for the original order and removed from the new version.\n\nThat case \u2014 the so-called \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d cited by Conway during a widely criticized television appearance \u2014 involved two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green, Ky., who were sentenced to prison in 2013 after admitting to using makeshift explosive devices in Iraq and trying to send money to fund terrorism.\n\nThe other example is accurate and points to Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia who was convicted of plotting to bomb the Portland Christmas tree lighting in 2010. According to federal officials, he began communicating with a Saudi national to discuss traveling to Yemen for training before undercover FBI operatives reached out and they began corresponding about plotting an attack. Mohamud was arrested after trying to detonate his bomb, which was inert.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nFact-checking Trump\u2019s claim that \u2018more than 300\u2019 refugees are subjects of counterterrorism investigations", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["partially", "travel", "trump", "restores", "ban", "supreme", "terrorist", "wouldnt", "deadly", "court", "united", "trumps", "countries", "version", "states", "attacks", "kept"], "summary": "President Trump's travel ban has been challenged in court at every turn.\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to let a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban take effect, so we are republishing an updated version of this story.\nThere have been 10 fatal attacks in the United States tied to Islamist extremist ideology or otherwise deemed international terrorism since 2001.\nThe two more recent mass shootings cited both involved people born in the United States.\nProtesters demonstrate in Richmond last month as a federal appeals court examined the travel ban."}
