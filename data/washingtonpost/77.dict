(John Woods/Canadian Press via AP)\n\nCanada\u2019s largest school system is calling off all future trips to the United States, citing uncertainty over President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nThe Toronto District School Board announced Thursday that no student or staff outings south of the border would be booked until further notice, saying it wasn\u2019t clear when the restrictions would come into effect.\n\nCanada isn\u2019t named in the ban, but the board expressed concerns that some of its students would face trouble on U.S.-bound trips, even if they had the proper paperwork. The district serves about 246,000 students and includes nearly 600 schools throughout Toronto, home to one of Canada\u2019s largest immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border,\u201d Director of Education John Malloy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to monitor this situation very closely and should we receive additional information or clarification with regards to what students could expect at the U.S. border, we may revisit these decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, based on all the information we currently have available to us, we feel this is the right action to take at this time.\u201d\n\nTrump unveiled his first executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries in January. After sparking widespread protests and creating confusion for untold numbers of foreigners, the order was blocked by federal judges at the request of several states that challenged it in court.\n\nThe administration issued a revised ban in February seeking to bar nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from obtaining visas to the United States and suspend the admission of new refugees. That order has also been temporarily frozen by federal judges, who said it appeared to discriminate against Muslims specifically.\n\nThe Toronto board said 24 already-approved trips involving about 800 students would proceed as planned, although it warned that if U.S. authorities turned away any students with appropriate documentation, the entire group would return to Toronto.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t have trips going across the border and a student for no legitimate reason being denied entry to the U.S.,\u201d Ryan Bird, a spokesman for the board, told the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not going to leave that student and continue on.\u201d\n\nWith a population of 2.6 million people, Toronto is home to 30 percent of Canada\u2019s recent immigrants, according to the city\u2019s website. In 2006, half of Toronto residents reported being born outside Canada. In 2013, it became the first Canadian city to declare itself a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d allowing undocumented immigrants to live, work and access services there, although a recent report questioned whether it could truly claim that status.\n\nToronto joins other school districts and Canadian groups in canceling trips to the United States over concerns about Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nThe Greater Essex County District School Board of Windsor, Ontario, suspended field trips in February, citing uncertainty over Trump\u2019s initial executive order, as The Washington Post\u2019s Amy B Wang reported. The board\u2019s worries mirrored those expressed by Toronto school officials Thursday.\n\n\u201cParamount for us is student safety,\u201d Clara Howitt, a school board superintendent, told the Windsor Star last month. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know what will happen to our students at the border.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with the Detroit Free Press, Howitt said canceled trips included one to watch \u201cThe Lion King\u201d at the Detroit Opera House and to the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\nEssex County\u2019s school board in southwestern Ontario canceled several trips in February, and the Ottawa-Carleton District school board sent a letter to parents asking whether their children would take part in planned trips to the United States, according to the Associated Press.\n\nJust last week, Canada\u2019s Girl Guides \u2014 the Canadian version of the Girl Scouts \u2014 canceled all future U.S. travel, citing their \u201ccommitment to inclusivity.\u201d They stopped short of mentioning the travel ban specifically, but the move was widely interpreted as a stand against Trump\u2019s executive order, as The Post\u2019s Brian Murphy reported. Among the canceled outings was a summer camping trip in California.\n\n\u201cThese values are reflected in all we do, including the Girl Guide travel experiences we offer girls and women,\u201d the Girl Guides said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that members will appreciate this reflects our commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunities for all girls and women.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix\n\nTrump\u2019s talk \u2014 \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 \u2018Islam hates us\u2019 \u2014 comes back to bite him in court again\n\nAppeals court judges rebuke Trump for \u2018personal attacks\u2019 on judiciary, \u2018intimidation\u2019\n\nIncreasing numbers of Muslim migrants trek north to Canada, sometimes through freezing temperatures and snow", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "type": "article"}
