They do nothing to make us safer \u2014 and may, in fact, make us less safe \u2014 but they punish Muslims, and that is his whole point.\n\nFear and loathing of Islam was one of Trump\u2019s campaign themes. He appealed to those who wrongly see the fight against terrorism as a clash of civilizations between Christian and Muslim worlds \u2014 and see Muslim immigrants as a kind of fifth column intent on destroying America from within.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d He later modified this position into a call for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants, including Syrian refugees. But he continued to cite a discredited survey, conducted by a stridently anti-Muslim group, purporting to show that many Muslims in this country support \u201cglobal jihad\u201d and the replacement of our legal system with Islamic sharia law.\n\n[Did you attend a protest? Tell us what you plan to do next.]\n\nIs Trump just playing politics or is he truly an anti-Muslim bigot who believes this rubbish? At this point, it hardly matters. He has fulfilled his campaign promise by striking a gratuitous blow against would-be immigrants and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen.\n\nEven more shamefully, Trump has barred entry by refugees from all nations worldwide. Perhaps he will have the Statue of Liberty toppled and sold for scrap.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Muslim ban,\u201d the president claimed in a statement. But unquestionably it is.\n\nFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, an early Trump supporter, said Saturday on Fox News that \u201cwhen [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said the ban is based not on religion, but rather \u201con places where there [is] substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\u201d\n\nThe countries covered by Trump\u2019s executive order were indeed singled out by the Obama administration for extra scrutiny. But if \u201csending terrorists\u201d were the major criterion, surely Trump would have included Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks came from.\n\nAnd as for the supposed goal of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for refugees, President Barack Obama already put such a system in place. In 2011, Obama paused the refugee flow so that authorities could reinvestigate tens of thousands of refugees who had already come to the United States. Homeland Security officials instituted rigorous vetting procedures for new refugees that require multiple interviews, and many months of waiting, before an applicant is cleared for entry.\n\nWhat, then, is the point of Trump\u2019s executive orders? To kick around some Muslims who are too weak to kick back \u2014 and to further the pernicious narrative of global conflict between Muslim and Christian worlds.\n\nTrump\u2019s orders carve out an exemption for religious minorities, which in this context clearly means Christians in majority-Muslim countries. By all means, I believe, the United States should be a haven for Christians or any other religious group that is persecuted. But the vast majority of those who have suffered at the hands of the Islamic State, the Syrian regime, al-Shabab and other evil forces in the affected countries are Muslims. If you prick them, do they not bleed?\n\nTrump\u2019s action was abominable; the reaction, however, has been heartening. Thousands of people spontaneously gathered at airports around the country in protest. Immigration lawyers set up shop in busy terminals and worked to gain entry for passengers who were detained. Federal judges intervened to keep travelers from being sent home. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his nation would welcome any refugees the United States turned away. Other world leaders criticized the move, as did \u2014 cautiously \u2014 a few Republican senators. Iran and Iraq warned they would reciprocate and close their borders to Americans.\n\nTrump\u2019s orders were not circulated through the normal interagency process before being issued, and it showed; key questions were left open, such as the status of green-card holders from the affected countries. But while the administration\u2019s incompetence might have blurred the orders\u2019 impact, it did not soften their intent.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about making America safe. It was about nationalism, xenophobia and punishing innocent Muslims for the vile acts committed by terrorists. It was a betrayal of our most fundamental American values. And he\u2019s been president for barely a week.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
