(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s temporary ban on refugees and other foreigners has significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, as GOP leaders on Capitol Hill complained angrily Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued.\n\nAt least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump\u2019s order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries does not amount to a \u201creligious test.\u201d And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored written statements expressing concerns about the order.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Monday that he was not briefed before the order was signed.\n\n\u201cI know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill \u2014 not in our office,\u201d he said.\n\nThe disarray over Trump\u2019s fulfillment of a core campaign promise underscored the increasingly strained relationship between the new White House and the Republican congressional majority. It comes after a rocky first week-and-a-half punctuated by confusion over health care and tax reform, as well as frustration with the president obsessing over crowd size and his loss of the popular vote in November.\n\nSen.

(Drew Angerer)\n\nAsked if he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said simply: \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPressed on when he first learned about the order, Corker answered that it was Friday, after it was signed. \u201cI guess one of you guys probably told me about it \u2014 thank you for that,\u201d Corker told reporters.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he could not confirm whether his staff was consulted \u2014 but he personally did not weigh in on the executive order as it was being drafted. Grassley\u2019s committee is responsible for overseeing the majority of immigration-related legislation in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if they said they consulted us, they did,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cBut not me personally.\u201d\n\nA member of Grassley\u2019s committee staff worked alongside other congressional staff to assist the Trump transition team on legislative issues, including early drafting of the executive order, one Senate GOP aide said. However, that staff member did not participate in writing the final order. The White House did not share details of the order with the committee before its release on Friday, the aide said.\n\nThe statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\n\n\u201cThere were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved,\u201d Spicer told reporters at a briefing. He refused to specify which committees were involved in the decision-making.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., joined by, from left, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, speak with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2017. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nPolitico reported Monday night that senior House Judiciary Committee staffers helped Trump\u2019s team draft the executive order without informing party leadership. A committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in a statement following the report: \u201cLike other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law. However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll out and implementation.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told reporters that his staff \u201cwas told the State Department, as of today, was ordered not to talk to Congress\u201d about the order. Asked about Rubio\u2019s remark, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement: \u201cThe Department remains in contact with Members of Congress who have reached out regarding the Executive Orders, and will continue to provide information and assistance as we are able.\u201d\n\nSenior House leaders, including Ryan (R-Wis.), did not see the text of the order until after it was signed Friday, according to a GOP aide. Antonia Ferrier, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said \u201cit was public\u201d that executive orders \u201cwere coming\u201d but declined to offer further clarity on the level of interaction with the White House.\n\nSpokespeople for Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the senators were not consulted at all about the order.\n\nSeveral GOP aides who requested anonymity to speak openly about the sensitive discussions said they were frustrated and surprised by the order and were forced to scramble to respond as chaos spread at airports across the country. Many said they felt the administration was moving too swiftly and without respect for critical protocol for vetting executive actions that have been in place for decades.\n\n\u201cThis is emblematic of a new, power-hungry White House staff flexing its muscles without consulting the public servants responsible for implementing their fiats. If this type of behavior continues, then this administration is going to lose all of its friends very quickly,\u201d said one Senate GOP aide.\n\nAs Republicans sparred over the formulation of the ban, they also tried to head off intense criticism that the order unfairly targets Muslims and does little to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nIn a morning email updating backers on various fronts, the head of Ryan\u2019s political organization said Trump\u2019s executive order was \u201cundoubtedly\u201d the \u201ctopic leading the weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to lay out the facts on this order so we can evaluate it from a place of reason,\u201d wrote Kevin Seifert. Two recipients shared the email with The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity.\n\nSeifert went on to argue that the order \u201cis not a religious test\u201dor a \u201cban on people of any religion.\u201d He wrote that \u201cfrom the perspective of Congress, this is an extension of the bill the House passed with a bipartisan veto-proof majority following the Paris terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nEven as Ryan was defending Trump\u2019s move, other Republicans on Capitol Hill were voicing growing anxiety about it. After many GOP elected officials stayed silent in the 24 hours after the order was issued, a flood of written statements started pouring in Sunday as lawmakers returned to Washington from their states and districts, and it continued Monday. Many statements included heavy doses of skepticism.\n\n\u201cWhile I support thorough vetting, I do not support restricting the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents,\u201d Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, there was some clear support for the measure in the party ranks, highlighting the how divisive it has been in the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t see these executive orders coming, you weren\u2019t looking very closely,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.). \u201cI don\u2019t know why my colleagues would be so negative toward it.\u201d\n\nDuncan, a member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs, said that everyone wanted to make sure that Americans with legal status would be able to travel freely but that that issue has since been resolved. He also dismissed criticism that the Trump administration did not execute the order smoothly.\n\n\u201cNot all of the Cabinet-level positions have been filled or confirmed by the Senate,\u201d Duncan said in an interview. \u201cYou have a lot of flux within the agencies that were implementing it.\u201d\n\nThe uproar over Trump\u2019s ban comes at a critical moment when congressional Republicans are looking to resolve other matters that many see as much more pressing. Among their most challenging tasks: formulating a consensus plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and shepherding a Supreme Court nominee to confirmation in the face of expected heavy Democratic resistance.\n\nCongressional Democrats on Monday continued fighting the ban, both through proposed legislation that would reverse it and a planned protest in front of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThis executive order was mean-spirited and un-American, it made us less secure, it put our troops in the field at increased risk, and it was implemented in a way that caused chaos and confusion across the country,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor.\n\nFor many Republicans, this was not an episode they relished.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of things we need to do, and I\u2019m focused on the long term and not these little battles that spring up along the way, so I\u2019m going to keep my powder dry so we can accomplish our overall agenda rather than to comment on each and every dust-up like this,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nMike DeBonis and Carol Morello contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "type": "article"}
