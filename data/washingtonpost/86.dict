Now, the government is finally taking action, only it\u2019s in the wrong direction. It has decided to make it more difficult \u2014 not easier \u2014 for foreign scientists and students to come to the United States and for U.S. scientists to collaborate with colleagues in other countries.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s travel ban is creating turmoil in U.S. laboratories. It is discouraging foreign scientists from coming to the United States, and it is creating a climate of insecurity and fear among many of those who are already here. It is threatening collaborative research projects involving U.S. and foreign scientists. And it is disrupting the flow of international students to U.S. universities.\n\nAs reported in the journal Nature, foreign-born scientists are reconsidering their plans to work or study in the United States because of Trump\u2019s actions on immigration. Meanwhile, administrators at Harvard University have cautioned foreign students and faculty about potential problems of reentry after traveling outside the United States. Such fears could have serious consequences for research and education in this country. Although the administration limited the scope of its 90-day travel ban to six majority-Muslim nations, the president\u2019s heated rhetoric has raised fears and created a climate of uncertainty about his administration\u2019s longer-term plans and intentions.\n\nWe have already seen a precipitous drop in applications to some U.S. engineering schools from international students, who are vital to science, technology, engineering and math graduate programs at universities. According to data from the National Science Foundation, foreign nationals represent more than 70 percent of full-time graduate students in electrical engineering, 63 percent in computer science and about half of all engineering faculty members. But the latest figures from many universities are worrisome. International applications for Dartmouth College\u2019s master\u2019s in engineering management are down 30 percent; at Vanderbilt University, engineering graduate applications from international students have declined 18 percent. The timing and application deadlines suggest that these drops may be due to Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric rather than the recent travel bans.\n\nThe United States has long benefited from the contributions of foreign-born scientists and engineers. Examples abound: Nearly a third of all science Nobel laureates who won their prizes while working in the United States were foreign born. Approximately 40 percent of Fortune 500 firms \u2014 including such tech-based giants as Google, Intel, eBay, and Apple \u2014 were started by immigrants or children of immigrants. More than five out of six patents in information technology in the United States in 2010 listed a foreign national among the inventors. In view of such contributions, the government should be doing more to attract foreign talent, not driving it away.\n\nScientific organizations have been speaking out on the travel ban. Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, called on the president \u201cto take a balanced approach to immigration that protects national security interests and advances our scientific leadership.\u201d Leaders of the biotechnology industry, heavily dependent on foreign talent, were more forceful. A letter \u2014 published in Nature Biotechnology and signed by 166 industry executives \u2014 stated bluntly: \u201cIf this misguided policy is not reversed, America is at risk of losing its leadership position in one of its most important sectors, one that will shape the world in the twenty-first century.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that anyone in the White House is listening. In previous administrations, the president\u2019s science adviser and his staff in the Office of Science and Technology Policy would have offered a scientific perspective on issues of this nature. That point of view might not have shaped the final outcome, but its presence would have suggested at least the possibility of informed decision-making. So far, the Trump administration has not named a science adviser or given an indication of how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the White House science office will be structured and staffed.\n\nThe travel ban set to go into effect this month highlights the need for establishing a channel of high-level scientific advice to the president in the form of an appointed science adviser. It also demonstrates the need for a concerted, unified effort by the scientific community to speak out and oppose such misguided policies. The president needs to turn his attention to this situation soon. It is essential that, as we seek to secure our borders and protect the nation against terrorism and other threats to our security, we do not allow the strength and international reputation of our scientific enterprise to become collateral damage.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-10", "type": "article"}
