(Jeff Chiu/Associated Press)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s losing streak on his travel ban continues. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld almost entirely the ruling from a district court in Hawaii (\u201can island in the Pacific\u201d) striking down the second version of his travel ban. The time spent in defending thinly disguised efforts to stoke Islamophobia has long surpassed the time he originally laid out in the original plan to devise a super-duper vetting plan to examine people from the seven (later six) countries he identified.\n\nAn ACLU spokesman told me, \u201cTwo appeals courts have now looked at the Muslim ban and both have forcefully ruled that the ban is unlawful. Although the Fourth and Ninth Circuits used different rationales, both courts were clear that there is no justification for this type of ban.\u201d\n\nThe Ninth Circuit once again rejected his claim that he has near-unlimited power to ban certain groups:\n\nImmigration, even for the President, is not a one-person show. The President\u2019s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress. In suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit nationality-based discrimination and require the President to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees. On these statutory bases, we affirm in large part the district court\u2019s order.\n\nIn months of litigation, the administration seems not to have learned that courts simply do not buy arguments that his actions are unreviewable. As to the first, the court instructed the administration: \u201cWhatever deference we accord to the President\u2019s immigration and national security policy judgments does not preclude us from reviewing the policy at all. \u2026 We do not abdicate the judicial role, and we affirm our obligation \u2018to say what the law is\u2019 in this case. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).\u201d Why the government persists in the arrogant argument that courts have no place in this legal debate defies logic and competent legal strategy.\n\nOn the specific legal grounds, the court found the president did not \u201cfind that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d The court slams the administration for failing to provide minimal support for its draconian action: \u201cWe reject the first three reasons provided in Section 2(c) because they relate to preservation of government resources to review existing procedures and ensure adequate vetting procedures. There is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests. These identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests.\u201d It is as if the government\u2019s lawyers aren\u2019t bothering to or cannot get their client to collect data that the government certainly would have in its control \u2014 unless, of course, it has no evidentiary support for a purely political gesture.\n\nAs for the national security justification, the court likewise finds the government didn\u2019t come up with much of anything to justify excluding people from these countries. (\u201cThe Order does not tie these nationals in any way to terrorist organizations within the six designated countries. It does not identify these nationals as contributors to active conflict or as those responsible for insecure country conditions. It does not provide any link between an individual\u2019s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness. In short, the Order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d) Turning to the ban on refugees \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the court likewise doesn\u2019t see any rationale for the broad claim that such people are a threat to the United States.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said the White House stands by President Trump's travel ban, even after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against his administration on June 12. (Reuters)\n\nMoreover, the court also finds that the president\u2019s power is restricted by legislation passed in 1965 that prohibits discrimination in the visa issuance process. Supporters of the ban have argued that this statute didn\u2019t curtail the president\u2019s more general authority over immigration. The court didn\u2019t buy it.\n\nBecause the court found the administration did not meet its statutory requirements, there was no need to look at the constitutional infirmities of the ban.\n\nThe only \u201cwins\u201d here were the court\u2019s recognition that the government could continue its inter-agency review of vetting and that it was not necessary to enjoin the president specifically.\n\nWe find it hard to understand why the government\u2019s lawyers do not prevail upon the government to collect necessary data and make a persuasive showing as to why the travel ban is required for these six countries or why all refugees need to be banned. \u201cI\u2019m struck by the cumulative effect of the president\u2019s losses,\u201d says former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller. \u201cHe\u2019s lost on statutory grounds. He\u2019s lost on constitutional grounds. He\u2019s lost in the east, the west, and even on an island floating in the Pacific. He\u2019s lost on his first order, and he\u2019s lost on his second \u2018politically-correct, watered down\u2019 version.\u201d He adds: \u201cFor a president who promised we\u2019d get tired of all of his winning, his travel ban has been a catastrophe from day one.\u201d\n\nOne might conclude that the administration is too incompetent or lazy to make the required showing. We prefer a different theory: These orders have no national security or other justification, but rather are blatant appeals to prejudice that have no factual, rational basis. No lawyer in the world can defend that in court.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "type": "article"}
