Clifton, top, William Canby Jr. and Michelle Taryn Friedland. (AP)\n\nThe list of evidence-free claims from President Trump and his administration is long and growing. \u201cMillions\u201d of people voted illegally. Inauguration turnout was the \u201cbiggest ever.\u201d All negative polls are \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nNo matter how hard the administration is pressured to support its assertions, no matter how many \u201cfour-Pinocchio\u201d and \u201cpants on fire\u201d ratings follow, Trump doesn\u2019t relent. It\u2019s hard to imagine he feels the need to, especially when polls such as one this week out of Emerson College show registered voters find his administration more truthful than its interlocutors in the news media.\n\n'Trump administration seen as more truthful than news media'https://t.co/6LmsR5JOSW \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s defiance might work well as political theater, and there\u2019s no denying that it made for an effective presidential campaign. But as a legal strategy, it\u2019s already hitting roadblocks.\n\nThe first came last week, when a federal judge froze his controversial executive order shutting U.S. borders to refugees and migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries.\n\nBut the real blow came Thursday, when an appeals court upheld that freeze. In a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit found that the government had failed to show why the travel ban needed to be immediately reinstated, as The Washington Post\u2019s Matt Zapotosky reported.\n\nPresident Trump said on Feb. 9 that he looked forward to seeing the judges \"in court\" after a federal appeals court upheld the suspension of his controversial immigration order. (Editor's note: Audio only.) (The Washington Post)\n\nTo arrive at that decision, the appeals court did something close to what fact-checkers, journalists, scholars and others do every day when Trump and his surrogates make extraordinary claims: It demanded extraordinary evidence \u2014 or at least some evidence \u2014 for the administration\u2019s arguments.\n\nAnd it got none, the judges said.\n\nThe court asked the government to explain the \u201curgent need\u201d for the order to be restored, but Justice Department lawyers offered \u201cno evidence,\u201d the opinion read.\n\nIt asked for evidence in the form of legal precedents that noncitizens affected by the order \u201chave no rights\u201d under the Constitution. The court found the government\u2019s examples unconvincing.\n\nIt also asked for evidence that immigrants from the countries named in Trump\u2019s order had committed terrorist attacks in the United States. Instead, the government merely argued that the court \u201cmust not review its decision at all,\u201d according to the opinion.\n\n[Read the 9th Circuit\u2019s opinion on the travel ban]\n\nIn court papers, the government argued that the president\u2019s authority to suspend immigration was \u201cunreviewable,\u201d meaning the court couldn\u2019t check his power. That seemed to alarm the judges.\n\n\u201cThere is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability,\u201d the opinion read, \u201cwhich runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\u201d\n\nA federal appeals court ruled 3 to 0 against President Trump's controversial immigration ban that barred refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nThe only thing at issue in the case right now is the temporary order blocking Trump\u2019s travel ban. A decision on whether the travel ban is legal or constitutional could be a long way away.\n\nThe Trump administration says the travel ban is necessary to protect national security and defend the country against terrorism. Trump has even gone so far as to assert on Twitter that if a terrorist attack did happen, the judiciary would be to blame.\n\nWhile language like that might play well with the base, it didn\u2019t impress the court, suggested Mary Fan, an immigration and refugee law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.\n\n\u201cThe court can\u2019t abdicate responsibility in the face of fear-filled words like \u2018terrorism\u2019 or terms of deference like \u2018national security.\u2019 These are, of course, important interests, but you have to have substance behind the words,\u201d Fan told The Post.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just play upon these fears without giving the court a substantial reason to justify extreme exercises of power,\u201d Fan said. \u201cThe Trump administration made the 9th Circuit\u2019s job easier in the sense that they were so extreme in what they claimed about unreviewability that they made themselves into a straw man easy to knock down.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement it was reviewing the 9th Circuit\u2019s opinion.\n\nTrump reacted angrily on Thursday, accusing the judges of making a \u201cpolitical decision.\u201d He had previously used the phrase \u201cso-called judge\u201d to refer to U.S. District Judge James L. Robart, who penned the lower court decision that paved the way for the appeals court\u2019s ruling.\n\n[How Trump\u2019s travel ban broke from the normal executive order process]\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary will likely continue, but he\u2019ll have a hard time bashing individual judges on the appeals court because the opinion was unanimous and unsigned, said Jonathan Hafetz, a constitutional law professor at Seton Hall University School of Law. Writing on the legal blog Balkinization, Hafetz described the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling as an \u201cimportant moment in the defense of judicial independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, from his reckless implementation of the Executive Order to his flagrant attacks on the integrity of federal judges hearing these challenges, has transformed the case into an early \u2014 and critical \u2014 showdown over the independence of the judiciary in the United States,\u201d Hafetz wrote. The judges, he added, may have penned the opinion unanimously because they \u201crecognize the real and grave threat Trump poses to the foundations of the constitutional order.\u201d\n\nIn a case such as this one, the government faces a heavy burden. To lift the stay on Trump\u2019s executive order, it had to show both that it was likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and that leaving the stay in place would cause \u201cirreparable injury.\u201d It failed on both fronts.\n\n\u201cAlthough we agree that \u2018the government\u2019s interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order,'\u201d the court said, citing a past Supreme Court opinion, \u201cthe government has done little more than reiterate that fact.\u201d\n\nThe judges continued: \u201cDespite the district court\u2019s and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States\u2019 argument that the district court\u2019s order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.\u201d\n\nIn a damaging aside, the court raised questions about whether it could trust the administration\u2019s credibility on the status of the order itself, saying that the administration, through the White House counsel, had shifted positions on whether the order would apply to lawful permanent residents.\n\n[Trump\u2019s travel ban is the controversial policy almost nobody was begging for]\n\n\u201cThe White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cWe cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\u201d\n\nIn short, the court found the administration essentially unbelievable, as have many of Trump\u2019s critics.\n\nThough the court\u2019s ruling represents a significant setback for the administration, some legal observers cautioned about reading too much into it. The court has yet to rule on the merits of the case, including whether the order discriminates against Muslims specifically, as the plaintiffs \u2014 the states of Washington and Minnesota \u2014 argue.\n\n\u201cAre there tea leaves to read in this opinion? There sure are, particularly with respect to the judges\u2019 analysis of the government\u2019s likelihood of prevailing on the merits and its blithe dismissal of the government\u2019s claims of national security necessity,\u201d wrote Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s worth emphasizing that the grounds on which this order was fought are not the grounds on which the merits fight will happen,\u201d Wittes wrote. \u201cEventually, the court has to confront the clash between a broad delegation of power to the President \u2014 a delegation which gives him a lot of authority to do a lot of not-nice stuff to refugees and visa holders \u2014 in a context in which judges normally defer to the president, and the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n7 key take-aways from the court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s immigration order\n\nTrump\u2019s loose talk about Muslims gets weaponized in court against travel ban\n\nHow all-caps came to signify shouting, as in Trump\u2019s \u2018SEE YOU IN COURT \u2026\u2019", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["ruling", "travel", "judges", "trump", "ban", "appeals", "evidence", "court", "twitter", "opinion", "trumps", "confronts", "order", "administration", "gap"], "summary": "But the real blow came Thursday, when an appeals court upheld that freeze.\nIt also asked for evidence that immigrants from the countries named in Trump\u2019s order had committed terrorist attacks in the United States.\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)The only thing at issue in the case right now is the temporary order blocking Trump\u2019s travel ban.\nA decision on whether the travel ban is legal or constitutional could be a long way away.\nThe Trump administration says the travel ban is necessary to protect national security and defend the country against terrorism."}
