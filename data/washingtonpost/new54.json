Brinkema concluded, probably violates the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of religion.\n\nBrinkema\u2019s order applies only to Virginia residents and students, or employees of Virginia schools. A nationwide freeze has been in place for several days, having been issued in Washington state and upheld by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nIn her opinion, Brinkema wrote that the Commonwealth of Virginia \u201chas produced unrebutted evidence\u201d that the order \u201cwas not motivated by rational national security concerns\u201d but \u201creligious prejudice\u201d toward Muslims. She cited Trump\u2019s statements before taking office, as well as an interview in which former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (R) said that the president wanted a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Muslim Ban\u2019 was a centerpiece of the president\u2019s campaign for months, and the press release calling for it was still available on his website as of the day this Memorandum Opinion is being entered,\u201d Brinkema wrote.\n\nThe case against the order in Virginia is being litigated by the state\u2019s attorney general, Mark R. Herring (D). It was originally brought by lawyers for the Legal Aid Justice Center who were representing two Yemeni brothers turned away after landing at Dulles International Airport. The brothers have since been allowed into the country.\n\n\u201cI saw this unlawful, unconstitutional and un-American ban for what it is, and I\u2019m glad the court did too,\u201d Herring said Monday night. He said the decision \u201clays out in stunning detail the extent to which the Court finds this order to likely violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for the brothers, Tareq and Ammar Aziz, said the judge was \u201ccalling out the ban for what it really is, a Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nThe decision is significant, he noted, because a preliminary injunction requires a higher burden of proof than the temporary restraining order issued in Washington.\n\nAt a hearing Friday, Brinkema said judges throughout the country were \u201cbegging\u201d for evidence from the government to defend the ban. At the hearing, a lawyer for the Justice Department produced only a copy of the order as evidence, while arguing that Virginia has no standing to challenge the ban and federal courts have no power to weigh in on its rationale.\n\nBrinkema rejected that argument. \u201cMaximum power does not mean absolute power,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEvery presidential action must still comply with the limits set by Congress\u2019 delegation of power and the constraints of the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nShe also dismissed the idea that a halt on the ban would cause any harm. On the other hand, she said, the Commonwealth produced evidence that the ban is having a negative impact on students and faculty who can no longer leave the country for fear of losing their visas or who are no longer sure they can study in the state.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIronically, the only evidence in this record concerning national security indicates that the [order] may actually make the country less safe,\u201d Brinkema wrote, a reference to a letter from a bipartisan group of national security professionals decrying the impact of the ban abroad.\n\nThe judge concluded it was irrelevant that the ban does not cover all or even most Muslims, as long as Muslims were the target.\n\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory purpose that matters, no matter how inefficient the execution,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHowever, Brinkema declined Herring\u2019s request that the order be national, saying she did not want her order to be so broad as to infringe on other courts. The order from Washington, she noted, offers nationwide relief.\n\nTrump has said he is considering rewriting his executive order on the travel ban.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "wrote", "trump", "national", "ban", "issues", "evidence", "judge", "brinkema", "strong", "rebuke", "federal", "order", "power", "muslim", "virginia"], "summary": "The executive order, Judge Leonie M.
