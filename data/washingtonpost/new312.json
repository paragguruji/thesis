Mohammed Rashid, a refugee since age 14 and now 38 years old, had become an authority on the U.S. process of screening and resettling refugees. It was a niche that begot his nickname, which stirred some mixture of pride and sadness in him each time he heard it: \u201cMr. Resettlement.\u201d\n\nNow, in the wake of President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending admission of refugees, Rashid\u2019s expertise had become even more vital to the people of Dadaab, asprawling agglomeration of tents and stick huts the size of 12,000 football fields. It was his role to translate Trump\u2019s policy to those who had been waiting years for their flights to the United States. About 14,500 people in the camp are in the U.S. refugee pipeline, including Rashid\u2019s family of five.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen with Trump?\u201d Rahma Noor Farrah, a 25-year-old with bright purple eye shadow and a pink headscarf, asked Rashid. It was three days after the executive order had been issued, and she had spotted him in the camp\u2019s market, a dusty street lined by corrugated metal stalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a rough time together,\u201d he said.\n\nRashid had applied for resettlement in 2010. Farrah had applied in 2007. They had inched forward in the process, interview after interview, promising that they weren\u2019t terrorists, recounting the horrors that had broken their families.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hope as long as Trump is there,\u201d Farrah said.\n\n\u201cWe need to see what happens after 120 days,\u201d Rashid said, feigning optimism. That was how long Trump had said he would suspend the refu\u00adgee program, while U.S. officials reviewed its anti-terrorist provisions. The order also banned most visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days.\n\nRashid had stayed up late over the weekend, reading about the new policy on his 5-year-old Nokia phone, a quest he began by typing \u201cTrump News\u201d into Google.\n\nHe read about travelers stuck at U.S. airports and protests at arrival terminals, trying his best to imagine those places, even though he\u2019d never been on an airplane. He read @SenJohnMcCain criticizing the order. He read @realDonaldTrump saying the United States was now safer. He tried not to curse.\n\nAt night, during the few hours of electricity in the camp, Rashid watched CNN on his television, a gift from his brother, who had been resettled in Seattle four years ago and told Rashid upon arriving there, \u201cWe are behind the world, brother.\u201d\n\nNow, Rashid waited for any indication that the airport protests had been successful. He would fall asleep in front of the TV, then wake up and check his phone.\n\n\u201cAll day with him it is news, news, news,\u201d said his wife, Dahabo Abdulahi, shaking her head.\n\n***\n\nDadaab is a constellation of four camps, separated by bursts of thorny acacia trees and wide expanses of orange sand. Some areas remain as empty as they were when Rashid fled Somalia in 1992, as it was devoured by a civil war that left his mother and two sisters dead. But much of Dadaab is now a vast city of mud huts, tents, market stalls and U.N. offices. Nearly 300,000 refugees live here, most of them Somalis.\n\nThe Kenyan government has threatened for years to close the camp. Its new deadline is May.\n\nRashid grew up in the camp, attending school in white tents donated by foreign aid groups. But even after 25 years, it doesn\u2019t feel like home. His wife was raped here in the late 1990s when she went to collect firewood. His father was beaten and robbed while transporting food on a donkey cart. Rashid secures his hut, made of mud, sticks and corrugated metal, with a makeshift fence of tree branches and a metal door with a padlock.\n\n\n\nFood distribution at Dadaab becomes violent as men run for their rations. Food rations at the camp were recently cut in half, making life for the 270,000 refugees there even more difficult. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2010, the United Nations acknowledged his family\u2019s procession of traumas with a one-page letter \u2014 they had been chosen for resettlement in America.\n\nRashid learned as much as he could about the U.S. refu\u00adgee screening system, a labyrinthine process that involves eight federal agencies, six security databases, five background checks and four biometric security checks. His family got their medical exams. They sat for interviews with American caseworkers, who asked whether he had ever been a terrorist. Rashid said no. He said he was an English teacher.\n\nWhile he was waiting for his final approval in 2015, Rashid and his wife had a third child. According to U.S. policy, American officials would have to meet the baby before Rashid\u2019s family got on a plane. The visit still hasn\u2019t happened, because of the limited number of caseworkers and the many people waiting for the relatively few refu\u00adgee approvals each year.\n\nOn his Nokia, Rashid checked his status on the U.S. refu\u00adgee resettlement website every other day. The words never changed.\n\n\u201cSecurity status: currently clear,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOn hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease be patient.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOn Tuesday, four days after Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement, Rashid rode his bicycle, a clunky brown contraption with a red plastic flower on the handlebars, to the Horyaal Primary School.\n\nOn the blackboard he wrote: \u201cThe eye is a sense organ. It is used for seeing.\u201d\n\nThe students read the line aloud. Rashid walked around the room, where 40 children, all native Somali speakers, were crammed onto eight benches.\n\n\n\nMohammed Rashid teaches an English class in the Dadaab refugee camp. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nHe was trying to focus on the lesson, but his mind was on Trump\u2019s new policy. While the children copied notes from the board, Rashid pulled out his Nokia.\n\nHe read on CNN.com that the protests were gaining strength.\n\nHe read on Facebook that more than 100 Somali refugees, whose flights were scheduled for the following week, were stuck in Nairobi.\n\nAfter class, he walked outside.\n\n\u201cMr. Resettlement,\u201d Abdi Nasir Abukar, another teacher, called to him from a bench. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go crazy thinking about America. You\u2019re going to become a mad old man picking rubbish from the ground.\u201d\n\nAbukar, 29, had a different plan. He was going back to Somalia. The United Nations was offering about $400 as humanitarian assistance for each person who returned to parts of Somalia it considered relatively secure.\n\nRashid thought a move back to Somalia was too risky. In late January, al-Shabab militants had set off a car bomb at a hotel in Mogadishu, killing 28. Weeks earlier, they had attacked the city\u2019s port, leaving 16 dead.\n\n\u201cYou made your own choice,\u201d he said to Abukar.\n\nOut of earshot, Rashid said softly:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the crazy one.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nMohammed Rashid talks to two young women who also applied for refugee status in the United States. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring a lunch break, Rashid went to a restaurant in the camp with sky-blue wallpaper and a television playing a Somali-language news channel.\n\n\u201cPut on CNN,\u201d Rashid said.\n\nA waiter slid a metal plate of rice on his table as the television flashed to a reporter at an American diner, asking a bearded man what he thought about Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad people in those countries,\u201d the man said.\n\nRashid looked down at his rice.\n\n\u201cSome Americans don\u2019t seem like they know anything about the world,\u201d he said.\n\nBehind him, at a different table, an old man recognized Rashid.\n\n\u201cWhat can we expect to happen?\u201d the man asked. \u201cWill the Europeans take us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am advising everyone to be patient,\u201d Rashid said, and then he thumbed his phone again.\n\nA stream of pictures and headlines passed in front of him. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had said the executive order wasn\u2019t a Muslim ban. The Somali-born British track star Mo Farah had been detained at an airport. On Facebook, Rashid\u2019s friends in Seattle had posted a photo in front of the Space Needle.\n\n\u201cLook at them enjoying,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he pulled up the U.S. refugee resettlement website. It took a long time to load. His hands shook.\n\n\u201cPlease be patient,\u201d it said.\n\n***\n\nAs the week continued, it appeared to Rashid that the world\u2019s interest in the refugee suspension was fading.\n\nOn his phone, he read that the protests were shrinking. On television, the coverage shifted to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick.\n\nHe was running out of answers for the people who stopped him in the camp.\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking me, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 \u201d Rashid said, his expression suddenly severe. \u201cBut I\u2019m just a refugee like them.\u201d\n\nBut then Saturday morning, he woke up to a flurry of news articles about a judge\u2019s decision to halt the executive order. He read as much as he could. Then he went to the monthly food distribution, where he and hundreds of other refugees waited for bags of donated corn and beans in the 100-degree heat.\n\nWhile they waited, people kept coming up to Rashid, he recalled.\n\n\u201cI told them: \u2018It\u2019s finally good news. The judge has stopped Trump.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe knew the court order was tenuous. He kept checking his phone to see whether the news had changed again. But by late afternoon, he read that passengers from the seven banned countries were allowed to board their fights to the United States.\n\nThe door had cracked open again. This time, Rashid hoped, it would last long enough for his family to pass through.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about America,\u201d he explained over the phone. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s refu\u00adgee ban is a matter of life and death for some\n\nThey were freed from Boko Haram\u2019s rape camps.
