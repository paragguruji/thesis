(Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA Virginia federal judge ruled in favor of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban Friday, saying the president\u2019s inflammatory comments about banning Muslims do not erase his broad national security powers.\n\nThe decision hands the administration a symbolic victory, but the attempt to forbid travel from several majority-Muslim countries remains blocked by two other federal courts.\n\n[Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban]\n\nUnlike judges in Hawaii and Maryland, Judge Anthony J. Trenga concluded that the newer executive order differs enough from its predecessor that it is likely to pass constitutional muster.\n\n\u201cThis Court is no longer faced with a facially discriminatory order coupled with contemporaneous statements suggesting discriminatory intent,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe newer order is free of explicit religious discrimination, offers a national-security rationale for the six specific countries included and offers exceptions for individuals in the form of waivers, he noted.\n\nTrump\u2019s past statements, Trenga said, could not forever undermine the deference the president is legally owed in national-security matters. Nor, he argued, did more recent comments made by Trump and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller connecting the two orders.\n\n\u201cThe Court cannot conclude for the purposes of the Motion that these statements, together with the President\u2019s past statements, have effectively disqualified him from exercising his lawful presidential authority,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nSarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said officials there were pleased with the decision.\n\n\u201cAs the Court correctly explains, the President\u2019s Executive Order falls well within his authority to safeguard the nation\u2019s security,\u201d Flores said in a statement.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, Gadeir Abbas, an attorney representing the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the ruling was disappointing but had little practical significance. CAIR plans to appeal.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t change much for us,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cWhile we disagree with the decision, it doesn\u2019t affect any of the other injunctions that have been put in place, and it allows us now to take the next step, which is to get the full hearing before the Fourth Circuit.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has already appealed the Maryland judge\u2019s decision blocking the ban to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. The appeal of Trenga\u2019s ruling will go to the same court, where the cases could be combined.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said it was \u201cnot at all surprising\u201d that courts have been divided on the newer travel ban.\n\n\u201cThe second version of the executive order is certainly on stronger legal footing than the original,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball is very much now in the 4th Circuit\u2019s court.\u201d\n\nDefending the ban in a court hearing on Tuesday, Chad Readler, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, concurred with Trenga that the \u201ctaint\u201d of Trump\u2019s comments on Muslims must at some point end.\n\n\u201cThe president has power to deny entry to this country,\u201d Readler said.\n\nAbbas responded in court that both the order itself and the statements made around it were so discriminatory that national-security deference cannot apply.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no unringing of the bell; they can\u2019t erase history,\u201d he argued. \u201cWhat the government has done is so unprecedented. We\u2019ve never dealt with a president issuing an executive order restricting travel from certain countries on religious grounds. This order, because it\u2019s so deviant, is not what it says it is.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s own comments form a \u201csingle causal chain,\u201d he argued, from a desire to ban all Muslims to the latest order. After the judge in Hawaii issued his preliminary injunction, Trump called the new travel ban a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the first one. Miller said there were \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d between the two but the \u201csame policy outcome.\u201d\n\nAbbas also contended that the national-security justification is flimsy and that it makes the order\u2019s discriminatory purpose clear. A Department of Homeland Security report on the countries involved, Abbas noted, found that citizens from those countries are \u201crarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism\u201d and that citizenship itself is an \u201cunreliable indicator of terrorist threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nTrenga concluded that such criticisms were not enough to overcome the president\u2019s broad national-security powers.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not whether [the executive order] is wise, necessary, under- or overinclusive, or even fair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is not whether [the order] could have been more usefully directed to populations living in particular geographical areas presenting even greater threats to national security or even whether it is politically motivated. Rather, the core substantive issue of law \u2026 is whether [the order] falls within the bounds of the President\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d\n\nCAIR sued the president on behalf of activists who say that all Muslims are victims of an order designed to stigmatize Islam. The executive order violates the Constitution\u2019s ban on religious discrimination, they believe, as well as a 1965 law barring discrimination in visa approval based on nationality.\n\nThe plaintiffs also include two students in the United States on visas, two citizens who hope to bring their wives to the country and several people who want family abroad to be able to visit. Readler argued that none of those plaintiffs had standing to challenge the ban because they are not suffering imminent, irreparable harm. Assuming the order takes effect, their relatives could apply for waivers, he said, which would be incorporated into the existing visa interview process.\n\nTrenga did side with the plaintiffs on that issue, saying they have standing as American Muslims to challenge the ban.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "type": "article"}
