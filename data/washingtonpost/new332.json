(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe fallout Monday from President Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration order exposed painful rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet and fueled suspicions among his top advisers.\n\nThat left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame \u2014 capped by Trump\u2019s remarkable decision late Monday to fire the acting attorney general because she refused to enforce the order as potentially unlawful.\n\nFor all the promises of Republican bonhomie, Trump and his aides kept GOP congressional leaders almost completely in the dark about the most consequential act of his young presidency: a temporary ban on refugees and on anyone from seven majority-Muslim nations.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them.\n\nInside the West Wing, tensions flared as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nMiller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move in television interviews.\n\nAs it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump\u2019s orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public.\n\n\u201cThe problem they\u2019ve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump.\n\n[The first days inside Trump\u2019s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot]\n\nThe infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller.\n\n\u201cThis weekend was a disgrace and it\u2019s all on your shoulders,\u201d Scarborough intoned.\n\nHis commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) recently appeared, he received a congratulatory call from Trump just moments later.\n\n1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Protest at New York\u2019s JFK airport against Trump\u2019s order halting refu\u00adgee admissions View Photos Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president, and some travelers were detained at U.S. airports.

It\u2019s not realistic. It\u2019s not practical,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI strongly agree with the general direction we\u2019re going, but I think this particular fight doesn\u2019t emotionally make any sense.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Trump\u2019s leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials \u2014 Bannon and Miller chief among them \u2014 are actively shaping policy and guiding the president\u2019s decisions. Others \u2014 such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions.\n\nThe Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus\u2019s wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception.\n\nThe competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues\u2019 motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.\n\n\u201cA little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing,\u201d one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. \u201cWe have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he\u2019s seeing shadows where there are no shadows.\u201d\n\nDuring the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions.\n\nBut Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House.\n\nWhite House officials reject the notion that chaos has overshadowed the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency. They say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order.\n\n\u201cWhile false narratives circulate, the White House staff is busy working, together, to implement President Trump\u2019s agenda for the betterment of our country,\u201d said a White House spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nTrump fired off angry tweets attacking the media and lawmakers who criticized his ban, from mocking Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for his \u201ctears\u201d to labeling Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u201csadly weak.\u201d\n\nLate Monday evening, Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates, who had instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump\u2019s immigration order. The White House said in a statement that Yates had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Justice Department and called her \u201cvery weak on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nPrivately, the president seethed, venting about what he saw as unfair news coverage on a second straight weekend of mass protests, and quizzing confidants about their impressions of how his senior staffers were performing.\n\n[Donald Trump waits in his tower \u2014 accessible, yet isolated]\n\nAs the controversy swirled, Trump, who has taken to giving visitors mini-tours of his new residence, found comfort in a trio of loyalists who share a room just steps from the Oval Office \u2014 Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman who has been at Trump\u2019s side since before his campaign launch; Johnny McEntee, a former college football quarterback who is now the president\u2019s personal aide; and Keith Schiller, a retired New York police officer and head of Trump\u2019s personal security detail who now directs Oval Office operations.\n\nNonetheless, some of Trump\u2019s friends as well as his critics fear that his agenda may be compromised by mismanagement.\n\n\u201cFrankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff,\u201d said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump\u2019s primary rivals. \u201cIf I were the president, I\u2019d be very upset with the staff \u2014 that they didn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, wait, hold on a second.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, \u2018Hey, your message is fine but here is what\u2019s going to come from it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, many Republicans close to leadership were frustrated that they received little to no guidance, or advance notice, about Trump\u2019s immigration and refu\u00adgee directive. One top House office said it was able to glean the president\u2019s plan only through unofficial back channels to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAsked if he was consulted in drafting the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) replied simply, \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 an echo of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who told reporters Monday that the White House had not briefed him before signing the order.\n\nThe first substantive guidance to congressional Republicans came late Saturday \u2014 well after protesters had descended on the nation\u2019s airports \u2014 in a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy but, to the chagrin of several Capitol Hill aides, very little political guidance. At the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on \u201cvictims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals.\u201d\n\nIt was not only Trump\u2019s immigration order that rankled official Washington. His presidential memorandum that restructured the National Security Council to elevate Bannon to a seat on the Principals Committee, alongside the secretaries of state and defense, worried many in the national security community. Also concerning was language suggesting that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could only attend certain Principals Committee meetings.\n\nBut Spicer told reporters Monday that Trump was revising the directive to also include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he insisted that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chairman would be included in any Principals Committee meeting they wish to attend.\n\nThe confusion out of the White House about the president\u2019s intentions left some of the government\u2019s most decorated officials scrambling to assert their relevance. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs, took the unusual step of issuing a statement to emphasize that he will \u201cfully participate\u201d in giving the president military advice.\n\n\u201cI remain honored and humbled to represent the extraordinary men and women of the Joint Force in serving the president and our nation,\u201d Dunford wrote.\n\nKaren DeYoung, Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["trump", "bannon", "gop", "priebus", "immigration", "president", "trumps", "directive", "rifts", "disorder", "staff", "order", "white", "house", "exposed"], "summary": "(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)The fallout Monday from President Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration order exposed painful rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet and fueled suspicions among his top advisers.\nPresident Trump signed an executive order that halted refugees and residents from certain predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.\nBut Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House.\nThey say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order.\nAt the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on \u201cvictims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals.\u201dIt was not only Trump\u2019s immigration order that rankled official Washington."}
