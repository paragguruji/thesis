(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nDozens of State Department officials are expected to sign a memo opposing President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries, activating the famous \u201cDissent Channel,\u201d which diplomats have used for decades, to oppose what they see as wrongheaded policies put forth by the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cA policy which closes our doors to over 200 million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans from using the visa system to enter the United States will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,\u201d reads a draft of the Dissent Channel memo, which I obtained. \u201cMoreover, such a policy runs counter to core American values of nondiscrimination, fair play, and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s half-baked travel ban is a picture of American shame]\n\nThe memo focuses on Section 3 of the executive order Trump signed Jan. 27, which temporarily suspends the issuance of visas and other immigration benefits for citizens from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. As of Monday morning, edits and signatures were still being collected in advance of submitting the memo to State Department leadership.\n\nThe memo argues that the executive order is poorly conceived and poorly drafted and that its implementation will damage U.S. relationships with Muslim countries, U.S. standing in the Muslim world and the U.S. fight against terrorism and radicalization both at home and abroad. The diplomats point out that \u201ca vanishingly small number\u201d of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil have been committed by terrorists coming from abroad on a visa, and in those cases, they came from countries not covered by the executive order.\n\nWhile the order will have little or no benefit to American security, it will have negative effects, the diplomats argue. Soured relations with the Muslim world will harm cooperation with allied countries in the fight against terrorism. The ill will created by the moves will alienate citizens in these countries and fuel radicalization of their mostly younger populations.\n\nIn addition to the harmful effects to the fight against terrorism, the executive order also undermines America\u2019s moral leadership in the world, the dissent memo states.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered at the arrivals gate of Washington Dulles International Airport to push back against President Trump's executive order that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

The diplomats refer back to dark times in American history when nationality was a litmus test for immigration and certain citizens, such as Japanese Americans during World War II, were subjected to discrimination and mistreatment.\n\n\u201cDecades from now, we will look back and realize we made the same mistakes our predecessors: shutting borders in a knee-jerk reaction instead of setting up systems of checks that protect our interests and our values,\u201d the memo states.\n\n[Trump\u2019s refugee ban could get much, much worse. That\u2019s why it must be stopped \u2014 now.]\n\nThe memo suggests alternative methods for improving visa and immigration screening, including through expanded interagency cooperation and increased vetting procedures not based on nationality alone.\n\nThe Dissent Channel was created in 1971 during the controversies surrounding the Vietnam War. State Department regulations stipulate that all Dissent Channel messages must be conveyed to all the top leaders of the State Department, including the secretary of state, who must formally respond. Last year, more than 50 officials signed a Dissent Chanel memo opposing the U.S. policy in Syria.\n\nThe diplomats signing the Dissent Channel memo are taking a risk by putting their names to their opposition to a White House that has been openly hostile to the foreign policy establishment in Washington and suspicious of government employees in federal agencies.\n\n\u201cFreedom from reprisal for Dissent Channel users is strictly enforced,\u201d the regulations state. \u201cOfficers or employees found to have engaged in retaliation or reprisal against Dissent Channel users \u2026 will be subject to disciplinary action.\u201d\n\nBut many in the State Department want to be on record expressing their disagreement with the Trump White House\u2019s actions. Several told me they felt they had no choice but to stand on principle.\n\n\u201cThis dissent cable illustrates a widespread sense of outrage and alarm throughout the building,\u201d one State Department official said. \u201cMost State Department career staff signed up for these jobs with a sense of duty and pride in America on the world stage. One role is to uphold and represent American values and strategic interests on the world stage. This executive order is contrary to that mission.\u201d\n\nThis is not the end of their activity either; I\u2019m told more Dissent Channel memos are in the works and are expected to receive widespread support.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["executive", "channel", "world", "ban", "state", "better", "memo", "american", "countries", "order", "department", "dissent"], "summary": "The State Department building.\nAs of Monday morning, edits and signatures were still being collected in advance of submitting the memo to State Department leadership.\nState Department regulations stipulate that all Dissent Channel messages must be conveyed to all the top leaders of the State Department, including the secretary of state, who must formally respond.\n\u201cThis dissent cable illustrates a widespread sense of outrage and alarm throughout the building,\u201d one State Department official said.\n\u201cMost State Department career staff signed up for these jobs with a sense of duty and pride in America on the world stage."}
