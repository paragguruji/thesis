(Damian Dovarganes)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 The NFL Players Association expressed its support Thursday for Muslim players in the league amid the controversy generated by President Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nNFLPA officials said the union reached out to the families of Muslim players in the NFL at the behest of Eric Winston, the veteran offensive lineman for the Cincinnati Bengals who serves as the union\u2019s president. About 15 players and their families were contacted, a union official said.\n\n\u201cAt Eric\u2019s direction, we notified and sent information to all of those families who are members of the National Football League just to tell them that if they need anything from their union that we\u2019re there 100 percent,\u201d said DeMaurice Smith, the NLFPA\u2019s executive director.\n\n[Roger Goodell refuses to express a view on Trump\u2019s immigration order]\n\nWinston expressed strong support publicly on Thursday for the league\u2019s Muslim players. That came a day after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell declined to express a view on the Trump administration\u2019s order temporarily banning entry into the U.S. for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world.\n\n\u201cOur Muslim brothers that are in this league, we have their backs,\u201d Winston said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. And we\u2019re gonna do whatever we can. I\u2019ll go stand with them. If people want to come to our house or family or whatever, I\u2019ll be there with them. It\u2019s simple. But the idea that \u2014 and not to get too broadly into this\u2014but we\u2019re starting to turn away from our values as a country. But these guys that are players in the National Football League, their families are our families. And I take that seriously.\n\n\u201cI think about them like that, in that we are going to do whatever it takes to protect them and their families. And so they can call on us. They can call on me. They can call on De. They can call on any of these guys and we\u2019ll be there for them. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who we are as a people. But I\u2019ll leave that discussion for another day.\u201d\n\nWinston spoke at the union\u2019s annual news conference during Super Bowl week.\n\n\u201cWhether you agree or not, there\u2019s a personal side,\u201d Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson, a member of the union\u2019s ruling executive committee, said following the news conference. \u201cI\u2019m always aware of and have compassion for people\u2019s feelings whether I agree with them or not. I think that obviously this is an issue that a lot of people feel very passionately about, and I think their voices should be heard. . . . My biggest thing with this whole issue is how it played out.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to lay out something like this that is going to be received in this way and you know it\u2019s going to be received in this way, I think it behooves you as the leader of our country to lay these things out practically, with uniformity. And it\u2019s okay with taking your stand. But be considerate when you tell people the why and when you explain those things because the constituency wants to know.\u201d\n\n[Mark Cuban on NBA Trump protests: \u201cIt\u2019s country first, basketball second\"]\n\nWatson said he did not take issue with Goodell saying Wednesday that he was \u201csingularly focused on the Super Bowl right now\u201d when asked during his annual state-of-the-league news conference about the immigration order.\n\n\u201cSo far as the league and their response, whatever they want to say and not say, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI think Eric said it best: We have guys on our panel who agree and disagree with politics. We\u2019re all over the board on the political spectrum. But we all care about people\u2019s feelings. We care about people\u2019s lives. And we want people to know that even if we agree or don\u2019t agree, we hear you and we love you regardless, and then we get to the other stuff later.\u201d\n\nWinston also said during Thursday\u2019s news conference that there must be better compliance with the NFL\u2019s concussion protocols.\n\n[The NFL\u2019s concussion protocol can\u2019t protect Matt Moore from football, but it should have done better]\n\nThe Miami Dolphins were cited by the league and union for failing to comply fully with the concussion protocol with their handling of a case involving quarterback Matt Moore during the AFC playoffs. Moore left a game in Pittsburgh after absorbing a hit to his jaw but was allowed to return after only one play. The NFL and NFLPA found that Moore should have been taken to the locker room for further evaluation.\n\n\u201cWe have to work with the teams and the teams have to work and do their jobs when it comes to concussion protocol,\u201d Winston said. \u201cThere has to be a better adherence to the concussion protocol. Even though it\u2019s a handful of times that we\u2019ve had to issue things or investigate, it\u2019s still too many. We\u2019ve got to get that number down to zero.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["expresses", "travel", "nfl", "wake", "players", "ban", "union", "league", "agree", "support", "think", "families", "trumps", "muslim", "protocol", "concussion"], "summary": "DeMaurice Smith and NFLPA expressed support Thursday for the league\u2019s Muslim players.\n(Damian Dovarganes)HOUSTON \u2014 The NFL Players Association expressed its support Thursday for Muslim players in the league amid the controversy generated by President Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n[Roger Goodell refuses to express a view on Trump\u2019s immigration order]Winston expressed strong support publicly on Thursday for the league\u2019s Muslim players.\n\u201cWe have to work with the teams and the teams have to work and do their jobs when it comes to concussion protocol,\u201d Winston said.\n\u201cThere has to be a better adherence to the concussion protocol."}
