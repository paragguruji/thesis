Her aim: To find personal stories that humanize a larger political conflict.\n\nNow, it is with a similar purposeful focus that Glidden has responded to President Trump\u2019s travel ban from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s executive order, Glidden \u2014 author of the nonfiction graphical narrative \u201cRolling Blackouts: Dispatches From Turkey, Syria and Iraq\u201d (Drawn & Quarterly) \u2014 responded by creating fundraising art to battle the ban.\n\nOver the weekend, anyone who donated at least $50 to the ACLU could send their receipt to the Seattle-based Glidden, who was delivering a comic of a character modeled after herself reading the news. She helped raise more than $8,000 in donations, she says.\n\nThe ACLU just filed a challenge to Trump's Muslim ban. Donate $50 bucks to them and send your receipt and address to sarahgliddencomics at gmail dot com and I'll mail you a drawing.

(The ACLU says it received $24 million in total online donations this past weekend \u2014 six times its yearly average.)\n\n(H/t @sarahglidden ) Donate to @ACLU and I\u2019ll draw u a wrestler pic.twitter.com/j0sIOMWDME \u2014 Box Brown (@boxbrown) January 28, 2017\n\n[The ACLU says it got $24 million in online donations this weekend, six times its yearly average]\n\n\u201cIt seems like everyone I know is trying to figure out how they can help fight back\u201d against Trump, Glidden tells The Post\u2019s Comic Riffs. \u201cFor cartoonists, I guess we feel like using our drawings to join that fight is the best we can do.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Sarah Glidden (@sarahglidden) on Jan 29, 2017 at 9:12am PST\n\nGlidden says she was \u201cabsolutely horrified\u201d when she learned of the travel ban, which she calls \u201ca complete disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we knew this was coming \u2014 he told us he was going to do this and we didn\u2019t believe him,\u201d the cartoonist says. \u201cI\u2019m glad that the ACLU is going to fight it through legal means.\n\n\u201cBut even if it eventually gets repealed, so much damage has already been done and we can never take it back,\u201d continues Glidden, who drew The Nib\u2019s new comic, \u201cWhy the Refugee Vetting Process Is Already Too Tough.\u201d \u201cThe message that this sends to Muslims and refugees all over the world is that Americans don\u2019t want them here. We were already sending this message, but now Trump has taken this to a new extreme. There are people who already felt unsafe and now it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe expanded version of my comic on the refugee vetting process is up on the Nib.

Is this the new normal in Trump\u2019s America?]\n\nGlidden, whose international comics journalism follows in the path of such greats as Joe Sacco, notes that numerous cartoonists have recently drawn to raise awareness of refugee plights.\n\n\u201cA lot of us have been pushing for refugee rights for a long time \u2014 the U.S. has a history of accepting refugees, but we also have a history of not doing our fair share compared to other developed nations, so we already had a lot of work to do before Trump came into power,\u201d she says.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s executive order \u201chas taken things to such an extreme that I felt like I would go nuts if I didn\u2019t do something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a drop in the bucket though. I\u2019ve been really inspired to see how people have been responding to this news. Hundreds of people heading to their local airports to protest, lawyers volunteering in droves to give legal aid to those detained, and refugees who already live here and have every reason to lay low who are sticking their necks out and telling their stories to journalists so that others can learn about their experiences.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s way more than a drawing can do.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/comicriffs", "type": "article"}
