(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThroughout Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and now into the first weeks of his presidency, critics suggested that he cool his incendiary rhetoric, that his words matter. His defenders responded that, as Corey Lewandowski said, he was being taken too \u201cliterally.\u201d Some, like Vice President Pence, wrote it all off to his \u201ccolorful style.\u201d Trump himself recently explained that his rhetoric about Muslims is popular, winning him \u201cstanding ovations.\u201d\n\nNo one apparently gave him anything like a Miranda warning: Anything he says can and will be used against him in a court of law.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now in the epic court battle over his travel ban, currently blocked by a temporary order set for argument Tuesday before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nThe states of Washington and Minnesota, which sued to block Trump\u2019s order, are citing the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric as evidence that the government\u2019s claims \u2014 that it\u2019s not a ban and not aimed at Muslims \u2014 are shams.\n\nIn court papers, Washington and Minnesota\u2019s attorneys general have pulled out quotes from speeches, news conferences and interviews as evidence that an executive order the administration argues is neutral was really motivated by animus toward Muslims and a \u201cdesire to harm a particular group.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to stop all Muslims from coming into the United States. Here's what he has said about Muslims since 2011. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nHis words, the two states say in their brief, show \u201cthat the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims.\u201d The courts, they say, \u201chave both the right and duty to examine\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201ctrue motives.\u201d\n\nThe states offer a multitude of exhibits, starting with a December 2015 release from the Trump campaign calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nThey cite his August speech advocating screening out people \u201cwho believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.\u201d\n\n[Trump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked travel ban]\n\nAnother exhibit: His Jan. 27 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he said he wanted to give priority to Christians in Syria.\n\nThey even hauled out Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s comment on Fox News that Trump wanted a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and requested he assemble a commission to show him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nIn response, government lawyers are trying to have Trump\u2019s rhetoric treated, so-to-speak, as inadmissible and irrelevant. It is inappropriate and contrary to precedent, they say in their brief, for the court to \u201c\u2018look behind\u2019 the stated basis for the Order to probe its subjective motivations.\u201d The states, they complain, are asking \u201cthe courts to take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national security judgment made by the President himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.\u201d\n\nHow the appeals court and ultimately, no doubt, the Supreme Court, respond remains to be seen. Both sides have their precedents to cite on probing presidential motive.\n\nAnd there are numerous other issues in the case, including the government\u2019s argument that the states do not have standing to sue. If the appeals court and the Supreme Court agree, this particular case could come to an abrupt halt without a decision on whether Trump\u2019s order violates anyone\u2019s rights under the Constitution.\n\nHowever it comes out, it may or may not sink in with Trump that his words can be used to wreak havoc with his policy agenda.\n\nHis remarks could hurt the government\u2019s key argument as it seeks to reinstate the order \u2014 that there was a \u201crational basis\u201d for issuing it \u2014 said Jayashri Srikantiah, an immigration law professor at Stanford Law School.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a record of evidence, as there is here, of the president making discriminatory comments about Muslims, the question is, does that animate the executive order?\u201d Srikantiah told The Washington Post. \u201cIf it does, it raises some serious concerns, and it reflects an intentional discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unusual for a president to make those kinds of statements so candidly or publicly,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn some ways, this is new territory.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s call for a Muslim ban came just days after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino in 2015, in which a Muslim couple shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others at a holiday party. In December, during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Trump suggested that the proposed ban was \u201cno different\u201d than President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nTrump again called for a \u201cban\u201d after the Pulse nightclub shooting in June, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. He framed the attack as an immigration issue, even though the shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan parents. The ban, Trump said in a speech in New Hampshire, would be lifted \u201cwhen we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen\u201d people entering the country.\n\n\u201cWe are importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.\u201d\n\nThe plan seemed to shift later in the summer, when Trump said he intended to suspend immigration from \u201cany nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\u201d When asked in an appearance on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in July if the change marked a \u201cpull-back on his Muslim ban,\u201d Trump responded that it didn\u2019t, saying it could be viewed instead as an \u201cexpansion.\u201d\n\n[What happens next with Trump\u2019s travel ban?]\n\nIn a foreign policy speech the following month, Trump proposed an ideological test for new immigrants, saying government should screen out any travelers \u201cwho believe that sharia law should supplant American law.\u201d He seemed to temper his remarks as the election drew closer, calling for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of people entering the country as opposed to an outright ban. But late last month, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said he wanted to give priority to Christian refugees over Muslims fleeing conflict in the Middle East.\n\nAll this and more have been submitted as exhibits in the case to illustrate that the travel restrictions aren\u2019t what the administration claims in court: A lawful \u201cexercise of the President\u2019s authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees\u201d that is neutral on nationality or religion, based not on any hostility toward Muslims but on a congressional determination of countries that are hotbeds of terrorism.\n\nIt is unknown what advice President Barack Obama gave to President Trump in the traditional letter left in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day. But he could have given Trump a lesson in how words come back to haunt presidents, as that\u2019s exactly what happened to Obama in his own immigration case when it reached the courts.\n\nWhen Texas and 25 other states successfully sued to temporarily block Obama\u2019s attempt to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation in 2015, among their chief arguments was that the president\u2019s executive actions were an overreach, an end-run around the Republican-controlled Congress that had refused to go along with his proposals.\n\nAmong their best pieces of evidence were some of Obama\u2019s own words, uttered at a moment of frustration when he was getting heckled for his deportation policy: \u201c\u2026 I just took an action to change the law,\u201d he responded.\n\nBoth the U.S. District Court in Texas and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit used those and other words against him when they ruled against Obama.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court deadlocked in the case, the lower court decisions stood.\n\nIt was, as The Post\u2019s Robert Barnes reported in June 2016, \u201cthe biggest legal defeat of his administration.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018If something happens\u2019: Trump points his finger in case of a terrorist attack\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll do better\u2019: Trump\u2019s White House tries to gain a sense of order amid missteps\n\n\u2018We are all Americans,\u2019 says Corona ad, meaning not just folks in those 50 states", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
