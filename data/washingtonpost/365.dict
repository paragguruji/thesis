{"title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s travel tweets do not hurt the legal case for his executive orders", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/05/trumps-travel-tweets-do-not-hurt-the-legal-case-for-his-executive-orders/", "text": "A fairly bizarre series of tweets by President Trump criticizing the Justice Department for its handling of his executive orders on visas has lead most observers to conclude that he has cemented the constitutional challenge to his own policies, blown up the government\u2019s case and confirmed his own bigotry.\n\nBut reading the actual tweets reveals absolutely none of this: To the contrary, they may actually buttress the government\u2019s defense of the travel restrictions in the Supreme Court. Certainly any reading of them as confirming a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d policy reads them through the same presumption of animus that informed the lower court readings of his campaign statements. However, animus is the thing to be proven \u2014 and it cannot be found in these tweets.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets were certainly Trumpian in tone, and the criticism of his own Justice Department for submitting an executive order he signed does not make him look good. But there is nothing in these tweets that should weaken the Solicitor General\u2019s case before the Supreme Court, or that supports the view that the policies were unconstitutional because of an impermissible motive on the president\u2019s part.\n\nFirst, he says that the measure is a \u201ctravel ban.\u201d That seems both obvious and uncompromising. Not issuing visas, capping refugee quotas and suspending travel by some foreigners obviously \u201cbans\u201d travel by those falling with the scope of the measure. But that is not remarkable; President Barack Obama did it too. The ACLU has tried to equate \u201ctravel ban\u201d with \u201cMuslim ban\u201d but obviously that is not what the tweet says, or even hints at.\n\nNext, he says that the new executive order is \u201cwatered down\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d This is all merely descriptive. The second measure is less broad and more limited than the first executive order; that is a fact. The first order was \u201cwatered down\u201d to respond to judicial and political opposition. They took something and made it less strong. That can also make it quite different, from a legal perspective.\n\nCommentators are reacting as if Trump said that the revised version is a \u201cwatered down\u201d Muslim ban. He did not. He said it is a watered down version of the first order, which everyone already knew.\n\nNor is it a constitutional offense to be politically incorrect. The first order was clearly politically incorrect, in the sense that it contradicted established pieties, as demonstrated by the reaction to it. But if the courts conclude that \u201cpolitical incorrectness\u201d constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause, they will be taking an even more unprecedented leap than when they held the executive orders unconstitutional because they were issued by Trump.\n\nFinally, the tweets may actually bolster the government\u2019s legal case (rather than purposefully undermine it, as Jack Goldsmith suggested). The tweets imply that Trump had little or no role in the drafting of the current executive order \u2014 the Justice Department is responsible. If we accept that, then any animus that may infect him would not attach to the order of which he is not the author, unless one is to say the administration is generally disabled from carrying out non-permissive immigration policies with respect to a quarter of the world\u2019s nations. And if one does not take his statement that the Justice Department is responsible for the order to mean the most it can mean, how can one read his campaign statements for their maximal, and worst, possible meaning?", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "type": "article"}
