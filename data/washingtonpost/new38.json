(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nJihadist groups on Sunday celebrated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam.\n\nComments posted to pro-Islamic State social media accounts predicted that President Trump\u2019s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists. One posting hailed the U.S. president as \u201cthe best caller to Islam,\u201d while others predicted that Trump would soon launch a new war in the Middle East.\n\n\u201c[Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a \u2018blessed ban,\u2019\u201d said one posting to a pro-Islamic State channel on Telegram, a social-media platform. The writer compared the executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a \u201cblessed invasion\u201d that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world.\n\n[Trump promised disruption. That\u2019s what he\u2019s delivering]\n\nSeveral postings suggested that Trump was fulfilling the predictions of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American born al-Qaeda leader and preacher who famously said that the \u201cWest would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhen U.S. President Donald Trump says \u2018We don\u2019t want them here\u2019 and bans the Muslim immigrants from Muslim countries, there is one thing that comes to our mind,\u201d said another posting, beneath a banner of Awlaki and his quote.\n\nAnother posting on the Telegram channel \u201cAbu Magrebi\u201d said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cclearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government\u2019s hatred toward Muslims.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the Islamic State speak frequently of their intention to drive a wedge between Western governments and their Muslim populations, and have welcomed outside help \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 in fulfilling that goal. In a 2015 essay in the Islamic State\u2019s English-language magazine Dabiq, the group said that its motivation for launching terrorist attacks in Europe was to provoke an anti-Muslim backlash that would force ambivalent Muslims to enlist with it.\n\n\u201cJihadists would have to argue to lengths that Obama, Bush, and others held anti-Islam agendas and hated the religion \u2014 not just radical terrorists,\u201d said Rita Katz, founder of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private organization that monitors jihadist websites. \u201cTrump, however, makes that argument a lot easier for them to sell to their followers.\u201d\n\n[Top Republicans fret about ban\u2019s execution, possible consequences ]\n\nThe reaction to the ban from Islamic State sympathizers came as current and former U.S. officials also expressed concern that the temporary ban would undermine the global fight against violent Islamist militants. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he worried about the ban\u2019s impact on Muslim troops fighting alongside Americans to destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cThe effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nRobert Richer, a 35-year CIA veteran and former chief of the agency\u2019s Near East division, said the ban was a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that could undermine future efforts to recruit spies and collect vital information about terrorists and their plans. How, he asked, can CIA officers persuade Iraqi and Syrian nationals to risk their lives to help the United States?\n\n\u201cThis was a win for jihadists and other anti-U.S. forces,\u201d said Richer, the deputy chief of the agency\u2019s Operations Directorate during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIt fuels the belief out there that Americans are anti-Islam. Otherwise, it accomplishes nothing, because the ones we are most concerned about can still get to the United States.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOfficials worry that U.S counterterrorism defenses will be weakened by Trump actions\n\nThe Islamic State has been oddly quiet about Trump\n\n\u2018Donald Trump destroyed my life,\u2019 says barred Iraqi who worked for U.S.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "muslims", "posting", "trump", "ban", "state", "united", "jihadist", "trumps", "victory", "hail", "president", "groups", "bans", "muslim", "islamic"], "summary": "President Trump signs a memorandum in the Oval Officer directing the Pentagon to come up with a plan to defeat the Islamic State.\n(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)Jihadist groups on Sunday celebrated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam.\nComments posted to pro-Islamic State social media accounts predicted that President Trump\u2019s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists.\n\u201cThe effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\nHow, he asked, can CIA officers persuade Iraqi and Syrian nationals to risk their lives to help the United States?"}
