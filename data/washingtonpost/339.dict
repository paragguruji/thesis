(Reuters/Yeganeh Torbati)\n\nFederal judges throughout the country are playing a highly visible role in the fight over President Trump\u2019s immigrant travel ban, issuing a series of rulings that temporarily put the order on ice. But apart from the few folks who can snag a coveted seat in the courtroom, the public rarely hears directly from those judges in real-time.\n\nNot so at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where the court is live-streaming audio from a key hearing on Tuesday that will help determine whether Trump\u2019s order affecting travelers from seven countries will be reinstated. Oral arguments before three appeals court judges will be broadcast from the court\u2019s website.\n\nThat broadcasting is common practice for the 9th Circuit \u2014 which hears appeals from federal courts in nine states, including California and Washington \u2014 but not for federal courts in much of the rest of the country. No other federal appeals courts stream live audio of arguments, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. And the 9th Circuit is one of only two circuit courts that have long allowed audio and video recordings of oral arguments. The hearing set for 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday will include only audio because it is being conducted as a conference call, with lawyers on phones not in court.\n\nThe federal judiciary system leaves it to individual circuit courts to decide whether to allow recordings of its proceedings, according to David Sellers, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Nearly all of the 13 circuits that handle appeals from the federal courts post audio recordings of their proceedings, according to a GAO report released last year. But most are not live-streamed, and instead are posted hours later or sometimes on the next day.\n\n\n\nSummary of video and audio recording coverage at federal courts of appeals.\n\nOnly the 9th Circuit and 2nd Circuit, located in New York City, have long allowed audio and video coverage of oral arguments. The Third Circuit, based in Philadelphia, began posting video recordings of select cases in January, and according to the court\u2019s website will make available video of cases \u201cdeemed to be of significant interest to the public.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the decision, Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith said the videos open \u201ca window through which the public will see the essential role that our federal judiciary plays in ensuring equal justice for all.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit prohibits the use of any electronic devices during regular court proceedings. Those attending oral arguments in the wood-paneled courtroom are repeatedly reminded to power off their cellphones, and it is not uncommon for people to be removed from the courtroom for trying to sneak a peek at their electronic devices.\n\nAt the Richmond-based 4th Circuit, members of the public who are not lawyers \u2013 including journalists \u2014 may not bring electronic devices into the courthouse. Cellphones must be stored in a cabinet in the courthouse lobby. Audio recordings are posted by the next business day, according to the 4th Circuit\u2019s website.\n\nThe three 9th Circuit judges hearing the case over Trump\u2019s travel ban on Tuesday are William C. Canby Jr., Richard Clifton and Michelle Taryn Friedland. After the appeals court rules, either side could appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThen, of course, all bets are off for any real-time listening or viewing. The camera-averse high court does not allow video or live-audio coverage of oral arguments.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
