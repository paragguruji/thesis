The White House claims the rules are needed because of security gaps in the six countries cited.\n\nHow Trump\u2019s travel ban broke from the normal executive order process\n\n\n\nBut Trump\u2019s latest comments possibly undercut that stance by calling the revised order a \u201cpolitically correct version\u201d \u2014 leaving open suggestions that religion was an element of the original order.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\u201d Trump wrote, using initials to refer to the Supreme Court.\n\nMinutes earlier, he posted: \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d\n\nTrump also called on the Justice Department to seek an \u201cexpedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court ,\u201d and study options for a \u201cmuch tougher version\u201d in the meantime.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2014 & seek much tougher version!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nBut it was Trump who put forward the revised travel ban provisions \u2014 dropping Iraq from the list and making other changes \u2014 after the original executive order was blocked by court challenges.\n\n[Trump\u2019s London reaction: stoking fears and rekindling feuds]\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Sunday, several lawmakers suggested in TV interviews that Trump\u2019s proposed ban is no longer necessary since the administration has had the time it claimed it needed to develop beefed-up vetting procedures to screen people coming to the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.\u201d\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the panel, said Trump\u2019s administration has had plenty of time at this point to examine how immigrants are let into the United States and make any improvements that are needed. \u201cIf the president wanted 90 days to re-examine how individuals from certain countries would enter the United States, he\u2019s had more than 90 days,\u201d Warner said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nTrump argued repeatedly on the campaign trail and after his victory that a better system for screening immigrants is imperative to national security. He signed an executive order in mid-March to temporarily suspend the U.S. refugee program and block visas for citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. He promised to develop more-comprehensive screening that would render the temporary ban unnecessary once in place.\n\nTrump renewed his call for the ban Sunday in response to the Saturday attacks near London Bridge, which left seven dead and dozens injured. The president tweeted: \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nThe travel ban was to last only 90 days, purportedly to buy agencies time to explore new procedures. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii have since suspended the ban, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed with the Maryland judge that the order was discriminatory.\n\nThe Justice Department interpreted the Hawaii court\u2019s decision to mean federal agencies couldn\u2019t work on new vetting procedures.\n\n\u201cWe have put our pens down,\u201d acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall told the told the 4th Circuit last month, when questioned about work on new procedures during a separate hearing about the travel ban. Wall said the administration has \u201cdone nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u201d\n\nTo get the travel ban reinstated, the Justice Department filed two emergency applications with the Supreme Court last week. If the court allows the development of new vetting procedures to go forward, that could start the clock on another 90 days for the administration to review vetting procedures. But that could also render a Supreme Court decision on the travel ban moot, since the court is not likely to hear that case before October.\n\nThat time frame has left some legal experts puzzled about the Trump administration\u2019s intent.\n\n\u201cThe enhanced procedures would be in place by the beginning of October,\u201d said Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard University. \u201cBy that time, the travel ban would not be in effect.\u201d\n\nAs more time goes by with no appearance of effort toward stronger vetting, it could undermine the administration\u2019s legal justification for a temporary travel ban.\n\n\u201cI think the travel ban is too broad, and that is why it\u2019s been rejected by the courts,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThe president is right, however, that we need to do a better job of vetting individuals who are coming from war-torn countries into our nation \u2026 but I do believe that the very broad ban that he has proposed is not the right way to go.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-04", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "hardens", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "justice", "vetting", "ramps", "court", "twitter", "trumps", "push", "procedures", "opposition", "order", "barrage"], "summary": "In a series of tweets, Trump circled back on his push for the travel ban in the wake of Saturday\u2019s terrorist attack in London \u2014 even as new opposition emerged from Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\nshould ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2014 & seek much tougher version!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nWe need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201dThe travel ban was to last only 90 days, purportedly to buy agencies time to explore new procedures.\nBut that could also render a Supreme Court decision on the travel ban moot, since the court is not likely to hear that case before October.\n\u201cBy that time, the travel ban would not be in effect.\u201dAs more time goes by with no appearance of effort toward stronger vetting, it could undermine the administration\u2019s legal justification for a temporary travel ban."}
