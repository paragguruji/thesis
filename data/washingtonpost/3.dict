Warren/AP)\n\nONCE AGAIN, a federal court has ruled against the Trump administration\u2019s temporary ban on admission into the United States of refugees and citizens of six majority-Muslim countries. And once again, the Justice Department is appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court \u2014 this time arguing that the government should not have to exclude from the ban grandparents or other close family members of people within the United States, along with refugees sponsored by American resettlement organizations, while the case is pending before the court.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the Justice Department hopes to gain by appealing this injunction against Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, as the Supreme Court was already set to hear arguments on the ban\u2019s legality on Oct. 10. What\u2019s more, a significant portion of the ban will likely have expired by that date \u2014 and the rest before the justices can even rule on the case.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order halts entry into the United States by citizens of the six banned countries for 90 days and suspends refugee admissions for 120 days. After courts blocked the ban, Mr. Trump clarified that these clocks would begin ticking as soon as the policy was allowed to go into effect. Because the Supreme Court lifted in part the lower-court injunctions against the order on June 26, the refugee ban will expire in late October, and the entry ban at the end of September.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Supreme Court can\u2019t rule on a case that no longer presents an ongoing issue. Yet the Justice Department hasn\u2019t given any indication of awareness that the court might well dismiss the case without deciding whether the ban is legal. Not only is the department now battling over an injunction on a policy that likely expires in two weeks, but its opening brief before the Supreme Court didn\u2019t even address the issue.\n\nIf the White House wants to keep the case alive, Mr. Trump could declare that the clock has yet to start with respect to those immigrants and refugees with \u201cbona fide\u201d connections to the United States, for whom the ban has remained on pause. Or he might extend the order on the grounds that the government has been unable to conduct reviews of vetting procedures \u2014 ostensibly what the halt in travel was meant to allow \u2014 without the ban fully in place. He could even issue a new ban or make the existing order permanent.\n\nYet the government\u2019s best option would be to allow time to run out on an executive order lacking in any security benefit to justify its cruelty. Permitting the ban to expire would let the administration save face while avoiding the risk of a damaging Supreme Court decision that could not only strike down the order but also place lasting constraints on presidential power over immigration and national security. Let\u2019s hope that, despite its choice to appeal the injunction, the Justice Department\u2019s silence on the ban\u2019s expiration is a sign that the government recognizes the opportunity to take the graceful way out.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-10", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "type": "article"}
