(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nBy a 10-to-3 majority, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2014 not some fringe \u201cso-called\u201d judge or a judge from an island or the wacky 9th Circuit \u2014 handed President Trump another loss, upholding the Maryland district\u2019s court striking down the second iteration of his travel ban. Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory slapped down the administration\u2019s argument that its executive order was not reviewable. The 4th Circuit found that \u201cthe Court has made clear that despite the political branches\u2019 plenary power over immigration, that power is still \u2018subject to important constitutional limitations,\u2019 . . . and that it is the judiciary\u2019s responsibility to uphold those limitations.\u201d The court reiterated that \u201cthe political branches\u2019 power over immigration is not tantamount to a constitutional blank check, and that vigorous judicial review is required when immigration action\u2019s constitutionality is in question.\u201d (You may recall that this same argument was rejected in litigation over the first travel ban.)\n\nIn rather candid terms, the court dismissed the administration\u2019s claim that national security necessitated the ban:\n\nPlaintiffs point to ample evidence that national security is not the true reason for EO-2 [the 2nd executive order], including, among other things, then-candidate Trump\u2019s numerous campaign statements expressing animus towards the Islamic faith; his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States; his subsequent explanation that he would effectuate this ban by targeting \u2018territories\u2019 instead of Muslims directly; the issuance of EO-1 [the original executive order], which targeted certain majority-Muslim nations and included a preference for religious minorities; an advisor\u2019s statement that the President had asked him to find a way to ban Muslims in a legal way; and the issuance of EO-2, which resembles EO-1 and which President Trump and his advisors described as having the same policy goals as EO-1.\n\nOnce again, the president and his advisers\u2019 own words proved to be their undoing. (\u201cWe cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face, for \u2018there\u2019s none so blind as they that won\u2019t see.\u2019 Jonathan Swift, Polite Conversation . . . If and when future courts are confronted with campaign or other statements proffered as evidence of governmental purpose, those courts must similarly determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether such statements are probative evidence of governmental purpose.\u201d)\n\nHaving decided to look for the actual motive behind the executive order, the court readily found that its actual purpose racial animus, plain and simple. The court held: \u201cThe evidence in the record, viewed from the standpoint of the reasonable observer, creates a compelling case that EO-2\u2019s primary purpose is religious. Then-candidate Trump\u2019s campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney general vows to take the case to the Supreme Court, but to what end? The purpose of the ban was to give the administration time to come up with super-duper vetting procedures. Surely, they could have accomplished that in four months (longer than the suggested ban on travel to seven countries in the first ban).\n\nMoreover, Trump just visited Saudi Arabia where he waxed eloquent about the Muslim religion and the need for peoples of all faiths to combat radicalized Islamic terrorists. He told Arab leaders from 55 countries, including five named in the original ban (Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya), \u201cTo the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce.\u201d He cannot expect his words to be taken seriously if, days later, he pursues an appeal seeking to uphold a ban on those traveling from these very same countries. He cannot on one hand commend the gathering as \u201ca symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect\u201d and promise that \u201cthe United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce,\u201d while continuing to seek to bar their citizens.\n\nWhy does Trump then pursue this useless, counterproductive ban? Most importantly, he cannot stand to lose. Regardless of the ban\u2019s utility, he\u2019ll not drop appeals and concede he was wrong. Second and more important, this is red meat for his crowd, the xenophobic, shiny object he can use to convince his core base that he is \u201cdoing something\u201d about foreigners, Muslims in particular.\n\nThe Muslim ban(s) revealed both the ineptness and the mean-spiritedness of this administration. But it also underscored the power of an independent judiciary, which remains a bulwark of liberty against bigoted, power-hungry leaders.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-26", "type": "article"}
