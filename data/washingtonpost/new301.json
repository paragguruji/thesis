(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nGoing into the latest court battle over President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, government lawyers were well aware that the administration\u2019s incendiary \u2014 many say bigoted \u2014 rhetoric about Muslims would be a liability.\n\nBefore the initial executive order was even issued, opponents had pulled together a list of public statements by Trump and his surrogates calling for a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and blaming Islam for the nation\u2019s problems. The states that challenged the order in court did the same, saying the remarks were evidence that the administration intended to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nIn response, the government\u2019s lawyers asked a federal judge to, effectively, look the other way. Instead of focusing on Trump\u2019s past remarks, they argued, the judge should only consider the plain language of the revised order in deciding whether it violated the Constitution.\n\nBut in his blistering opinion Wednesday freezing the new travel ban, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson said statements by Trump and his senior advisers were precisely what called its legality into question.\n\n[Appeals court judges rebuke Trump for \u2018personal attacks\u2019 on judiciary, \u2018intimidation\u2019]\n\n\u201cThese plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order, and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the Executive Order\u2019s stated secular purpose,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nAnd early Thursday morning, a federal judge ruling in a related case in Maryland said the order was \u201cthe realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\u201d as The Washington Post reported. Though U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang\u2019s opinion was narrower in scope than Watson\u2019s, he still found room to take aim at statements by Trump and his advisers, saying they showed \u201canimus toward Muslims and intention to impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nIn short, Trump\u2019s loose talk had come back to bite him yet again. Only this time the criticism was coming straight from federal judges.\n\nWatson\u2019s opinion was remarkable given that other judges who have ruled on the travel ban have stopped short of saying that the Trump administration\u2019s statements showed discriminatory intent, according to Mary Fan, an immigration and refugee law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.\n\n\u201cThe judge actually tackled the big elephant in the room, which has drawn so much consternation,\u201d Fan said.\n\nIndeed, as legal challenges to the ban advance, the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric may become the albatross the government can\u2019t shake.\n\n\u201cThe history and the many, many statements from Trump and his senior advisers will haunt this travel ban however long the language of it evolves,\u201d Fan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t rewrite history, all the many quotes and tweets that are already out there.\u201d\n\n[Read the federal judge\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s new travel ban]\n\nIn his opinion, which came in response to a lawsuit by the state of Hawaii, Watson said Trump\u2019s remarks on the campaign trail, along with commentary from his advisers, amounted to \u201csignificant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus.\u201d\n\nThe judge pointed to a March 2016 interview then-candidate Trump gave on CNN, in which he said \u201cI think Islam hates us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States,\u201d Trump said in the interview, \u201cand of people that are not Muslim.\u201d\n\nWatson also cited a July 2016 interview in which Trump said changes to his proposed ban really amounted to \u201can expansion,\u201d and a moment in the Oct. 9 presidential debate when Trump suggested the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d had morphed into \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s original travel ban, issued in January, sought to shut U.S. borders to refugees and migrants from seven mostly Muslim countries. The revised ban, issued in February, seeks to bar new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the admission of new refugees.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit halted the original order shortly after Trump signed it. In its ruling, the court didn\u2019t take a stance on whether the order discriminated against Muslims, but noted that the states of Washington and Minnesota had \u201coffered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.\u201d\n\nBracing for those claims to come up again in litigation over the revised order, government lawyers argued that it wasn\u2019t Watson\u2019s job to investigate the \u201cveiled psyche\u201d and \u201csecret motives\u201d of policymakers. Nor should the judge undertake a \u201cjudicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\u2019s heart of hearts,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cGovernment need not fear,\u201d the judge responded in his opinion. \u201cThe remarkable facts at issue here require no such impermissible inquiry. For instance, there is nothing \u2018veiled\u2019 about this press release: \u2018Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNor was there anything secret about the White House\u2019s motive, according to the judge.\n\nThe opinion read: \u201cRudolph Giuliani explained on television how the Executive Order came to be. He said: \u2018When [Mr. Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnother example, Watson wrote, came in a Feb. 21 interview senior policy adviser Stephen Miller granted Fox News. In it, Miller said the revised ban would contain \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d from the original, and would result in \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cA reasonable, objective observer \u2014 enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance \u2014 would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nResponding to the ruling Wednesday evening, Trump said the administration would fight the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. He questioned whether the opinion was politically motivated and lamented that he had been pressured to sign a \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of his original travel ban.\n\nHis remarks, delivered at a rally in Nashville, may not do him any favors as the litigation moves forward.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nTrump adviser Roger Stone said he was a victim in Florida hit-and-run, possibly \u2018deliberate\u2019\n\nDid Trump have his own tax return leaked?
