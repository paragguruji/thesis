(Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Monday, late-night television hosts reacted to President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from across the globe from entering the United States. As the hosts tell it, the order made a lot of people very angry, but it also brought a lot of people together. At airports, no less!\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some of the memorable late-night commentary about Trump\u2019s immigration order and the resulting protests.\n\nJust about everyone made an airport joke\n\nConan O\u2019Brien: \u201cThis weekend, the nation\u2019s airports were filled with people protesting President Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. It was the largest collection of angry people at an airport since every United Airlines flight.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d Trevor Noah asked correspondent Hasan Minhaj, who had recently landed at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport, what he thought of the order.\n\n\u201cUsually, being a Muslim in an airport sucks,\u201d Minhaj explained. \u201cBut this weekend, it was like I was The Weeknd. I mean I land at JFK, I get to the arrival section. Literally, three white people run up to me, hug me and say \u2018thank you for being Muslim.\u2019 I\u2019m 31 years old. That\u2019s the first time anyone has thanked me for being Muslim.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel: \u201cThere were demonstrations in just about every major city yesterday, people went to the airport to protest \u2014 that\u2019s when you know people are mad. It\u2019s Sunday, they have no travel plans, and they go to the airport.\u201d\n\nJimmy Fallon: \u201cHere in New York, thousands of people showed up at JFK airport over the weekend to protest Trump\u2019s immigration ban. People who were actually at the protest said \u2018This is awful,\u2019 while the people at LaGuardia were like, \u2018You think you got it bad? We\u2019re at LaGuardia.\u2019\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert: \u201cNow, all of this is upsetting, if you\u2019re one of those people who thought about it. Which is why tens of thousands of protesters spontaneously demonstrated \u2014 do you have any idea how angry people have to be to voluntarily go to JFK?\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers: \u201cHe was detained for 18 hours at JFK and he still loves America,\u201d the \u2018Late Night\u2019 host said of an Iraqi man who once worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army. \u201cIf you can spend more than two hours at JFK without losing your s\u2014, you should get automatic citizenship.\u201d\n\nThere were also \u2018Finding Dory\u2019 jokes (Trump reportedly held a private screening of the animated film over the weekend)\n\nKimmel: \u201cWhile all this was happening, President Trump was hosting a screening at the White House of the movie \u2018Finding Dory,\u2019 which, ironically, is a movie about a fish trying to find her parents. To his credit, he was so moved by the film that he lifted all travel restrictions on clownfish.\u201d\n\nConan O\u2019Brien: \u201cKind of a turbulent weekend, but you should feel good about this, Donald Trump did find time to relax. True story, yesterday, Donald Trump spent the afternoon at the White House watching \u2018Finding Dory\u2019 with his family \u2026 apparently, in this version, Dory couldn\u2019t be found because she was being detained at the airport.\u201d\n\nNoah (in a Trump-esque voice): \u201cShhh, don\u2019t disturb me I don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening at the airports. I\u2019m watching a movie about families being separated. It\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\nNoah: \u201cBy the way, who hasn\u2019t watched \u2018Finding Dory\u2019 yet?! It\u2019s 2017! This man is not fit to be president. Not fit!\u201d\n\nFallon: \u201cWhile all this was going on, yesterday at the White House, Trump hosted a screening of the movie \u2018Finding Dory.\u2019 Trump said he actually related more to \u2018Finding Nemo\u2019 because that was about an orange and white cartoon.\u201d\n\nThe hosts analyzed how Trump and White House staffers responded to criticism\n\nColbert: \u201cNow Trump has responded to criticism that the plan was rushed, tweeting, \u2018If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u2019 I don\u2019t think President Trump has ever used quotation marks before.\u201d\n\nKimmel: \u201cTravelers from the seven restricted countries, most of them got a plane, had no idea they would be stopped or detained by immigration, including a 5-year-old boy who was detained for hours while his mother, who was born in Iran, waited at the gate for him. And that meant lucky Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had the unenviable job today of trying to explain how to detaining a 5-year-old helps to keep the country safe.\u201d (Cut to Spicer saying \u2018 \u2026 to assume that someone\u2019s age or gender or whatever that they don\u2019t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.\u2019) UNLESS THEY\u2019RE 5-YEARS-OLD.\u201d\n\nColbert: \u201cAt Dulles Airport, a 5-year-old Iranian boy was detained for hours and kept from his mother. Or as Kellyanne Conway calls it, alternative day care.\u201d\n\nThey suggested that maybe Trump didn\u2019t write the executive order after all\n\nMeyers: \u201cWhen Trump first announced the order at a signing ceremony over the weekend, he read it aloud like he was seeing it for the very first time. Hey man, it\u2019s not comforting to us when you seem shocked by the stuff you\u2019re signing. That\u2019s the way people look before they sign the injury waiver on \u2018American Ninja Warrior.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoah: \u201cHey Donald, I know you don\u2019t actually write or read any of those boring papers so let me explain to you what you did. You banned everyone from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. Even though you said your ban was to protect America from outside threats, that ban included people with green cards. It even seemed to include dual citizens of Canada or Britain or any other country you didn\u2019t plan to ban, you silly billy. Now go back to watching CNN.\u201d\n\nThey got serious\n\n\u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent Minhaj: \u201cHere\u2019s the beautiful irony. For years, Donald Trump has been terrified of the spread of Islam in America.\u201d (Cut to photos of protest signs including one that read \u201cWe are all Muslim now.\u201d) \u201cWell, congratulations, Mr. President. Mission accomplished.\u201d\n\nJames Corden\u2019s \u201cLate Late Show\u201d began with of the host breezily making his way through a terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. The video was followed by this message:\n\n\u201cToday James flew out of Los Angeles, so all of our shows this week have been pretaped. Freedom of movement should be this easy for all legal immigrants. Not just the white and Christian ones.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018He knows he won, right?\u2019: Late-night TV hosts mock Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/emily.yahr", "type": "article"}
