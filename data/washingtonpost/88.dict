(Jeff Chiu/Associated Press)\n\nIT IS possible to debate whether President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order was callous and counterproductive, as we believe it was. But there is no question that its rollout was sloppy and arrogant \u2014 and that includes the legal defense the government mounted when inevitably challenged in court. Four federal judges have now rejected several untenable claims the Trump administration made, and rightfully so.\n\nA three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled Thursday that the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on travel from seven majority-Muslim countries will remain on ice while the courts work through whether the restrictions are legal. This is only the beginning of a long battle, but there are a few arguments the judges dispensed with upfront.\n\nFor example, the government argued that the president has \u201cunreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens.\u201d The court easily batted down this dangerous contention: \u201cThere is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\u201d the panel wrote. \u201cAlthough courts owe considerable deference to the President\u2019s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.\u201d\n\nIn short: Mr. Trump needs to accept that he cannot rule by decree, without regard for judicial checks. The courts can and must block him when he overreaches, especially on matters of civil liberty and national security.\n\nThe government also argued that the court should ignore a glaring problem with the president\u2019s executive order \u2014 that it appeared to apply to green-card holders and others with legal status that rightly led them to expect that they would be able to travel into and out of the United States \u2014 because the White House counsel\u2019s office later issued an \u201cauthoritative guidance\u201d lifting restrictions from lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe court fired back: \u201cAt this point, however, we cannot rely upon the Government\u2019s contention that the Executive Order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cThe White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments. Moreover, in light of the Government\u2019s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Trump administration\u2019s erratic behavior has earned it no credibility with the judiciary, and it deserves no trust that any lawful elements of the order will be executed properly without supervision.\n\nAs if to illustrate that very point, Mr. Trump responded to the court ruling in his unsettlingly juvenile fashion, condemning the decision as \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d GOP critics pilloried President Barack Obama for issuing a relatively mild criticism of the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision. Mr. Trump, by contrast, continues to treat the judicial branch as yet another political enemy to bully into submission \u2014 behavior that reportedly led his own Supreme Court nominee to comment that attacks on judges are \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening.\u201d\n\nThe independence of and trust in the judiciary are prerequisites for a free society. What sort of society does Mr. Trump want?", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "type": "article"}
