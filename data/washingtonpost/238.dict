The American Civil Liberties Union said one reason the court should rule now on the travel ban is because the latest version \u201ccontinues to relay a message of disparagement\u201d to Muslims.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the justices will decide what to do with the case.\n\nBoth sides in the dispute that has raged almost since Trump took office in January filed letters with the high court Thursday addressing whether the case should be dismissed.\n\nThe justices canceled an argument session that was set for next week and asked the parties to weigh in on whether the court should sidestep, at least for now, ruling on the legality of a travel ban that affected visitors from six mostly Muslim countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Also at issue is a ban on refugees that expires on Oct. 24.\n\nThe travel ban lapsed Sept. 24. It was immediately replaced by a revised policy that the administration has said was based on an objective assessment of each country\u2019s security situation and willingness to share information with the U.S.\n\nOpponents have described the changes as window dressing that leave in place the heart of what they call a Muslim ban.\n\nThe administration has taken Sudan off the list and added Chad and North Korea, along with several officials from the government of Venezuela. The new policy takes full effect on Oct. 18.\n\nImmigrant advocacy and civil rights groups already have challenged the new policy.\n\nTrump Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the justices there is no sense in holding arguments or issuing a decision about policies no longer in effect or soon to expire.\n\n\u201cThe United States respectfully submits that both of these appeals are now or soon will be moot,\u201d Francisco wrote the court.\n\nThe two sides also disagreed about what the court should do if it decides not to hear the case now. The administration urged the justices to throw out lower court rulings against earlier versions of the ban. Otherwise, the administration said, opponents will try to use those decisions to bolster their challenges to the new policy.\n\nOpponents argued for leaving the lower court rulings against the ban in place. The administration controlled most of the timing issues that led to this point, and the court should not reward it by throwing out rulings that were unfavorable to the administration, the opponents said.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
