Sam Rasoul (D-Roanoke) began his remarks by bringing up a surprising detail of history.\n\nIn invoking Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Statute for Religious Freedom, Rasoul noted that that document was based on an earlier work by James Madison. And the reason Madison wrote his \u201cMemorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\u201d was, in part, because a religious minority was being regarded with suspicion, dislike and mistrust.\n\nThat religious minority was the Baptists.\n\nIn the years before and after the Revolution, the Anglican majority regarded Baptists as dangerous. Traveling Baptist preachers incited lower-class workers with religious fervor and even welcomed slaves and free blacks to their gatherings.\n\n\u201cThe Baptists were tormented and even imprisoned,\u201d Rasoul reminded the House. A Baptist minister named James Ireland was imprisoned in Culpeper, where the jailer allowed members of the public to urinate on him.\n\n\u201cMadison agreed with Jefferson that a republic without religious freedom was impossible,\u201d Rasoul said. \u201cThis liberty is a core Virginian value\u2026.What good is an American value if we\u2019re not ready to sacrifice for it?\n\n\u201cThe politics of hysteria and division are a distraction from what we should be focusing on...All sides shouldn\u2019t just defend Muslims, women, refugees, Latinos. We must defend our core American values.\u201d\n\nDel. Mark H. Levine (D-Alexandria) also rose to speak about Trump\u2019s actions over the weekend. Citing his own background as a Jew and his ancestors\u2019 success in seeking freedom in the United States, Levine said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the president\u2019s actions, especially the ban of Syrian refugees from entering the country.\n\n\u201cAmerica has always been a refuge for immigrants,\u201d Levine said. \u201cMy guess is that everyone in this chamber is a descendant of someone who came here from somewhere else. This is fundamentally who we are as a country. This is fundamentally who we are as Virginians. I know most of you oppose this. I ask you to speak out.\u201d\n\nBoth Levine and Rasoul were greeted by applause from all around the chamber. Levine\u2019s more emotional plea drew a standing ovation on the Democratic side of the House and in the visitors\u2019 gallery above. While Republicans didn\u2019t stand as a group, many could be seen clapping.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
