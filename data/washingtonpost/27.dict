A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump's executive order to immediately deny entry to the United States to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries has led to impassioned demonstrations at airports, international denunciations and even criticism from some fellow Republicans. It has also suffered two early defeats in the courts, after judges in New York and Virginia late Saturday blocked the deportations of those denied entry.\n\nThe Post's team has all the details here:\n\nTrump\u2019s order reverberated across the world Saturday, making it increasingly clear that the measure he had promised during his presidential campaign was casting a wider net than even his opponents had feared. Confusion and concern among immigrant advocates mounted throughout the day as travelers from the Middle East were detained at U.S. airports or sent home. A lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump\u2019s executive action, which was signed Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants. But as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries \u2014 green-card holders \u2014 who were abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the United States are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from U.S. allies, such as the United Kingdom. The virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions from not only Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Lawyers and advocates for immigrants are advising them to seek asylum in Canada.\n\nWith any other president, it would seem that the law of unintended consequences had begun to apply and that perhaps we might see a softening of the policy. The targeting of green-card holders \u2014 those previously legally allowed to be in the United States who suddenly find themselves in limbo \u2014 in particular seems to have caught everyone off guard.\n\nBut Trump isn't your average president. And his rhetoric on this issue has made clear he's likely to view the backlash and anecdotes of stranded travelers as merely the cost of doing business \u2014 a perhaps unfortunate side effect of keeping the country safe. We shouldn't expect any kind of hasty retreat, barring more successful legal challenges.\n\nA case in point is the response in the wee hours of Sunday morning from the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, it suggested the whole thing has been overblown, declaring that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international travelers were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order. That choice of words says plenty.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTrump himself assured reporters Saturday afternoon, \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were totally prepared.\u201d\n\nTrump also tweeted Sunday:\n\nOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017\n\nChristians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, his aides are reportedly saying behind close doors that all is well.\n\nsources: WH policy director Stephen Miller told govt employees Sat. that the public is behind the Exec Order, ignore hysterical voices on TV \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 29, 2017\n\nThose reactions say a lot about how firm Trump and his team will be on this.\n\nTrump's proposal to deny entry to the United States \u2014 initially to cover all Muslims, and then those from terrorism-prone countries (which are predominantly Muslim) -- shifted over the course of his campaign and transition effort, so we weren't sure exactly what we would be getting when he finally put it into practice as president.\n\nBut the constant was that it would be somewhat, well, extreme. He even called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants and refugees. Trump didn't apologize for this; he cited the need to keep the country safe from terrorism, at whatever cost.\n\nTrump administration officials defended the president's executive order temporarily banning entry to the U.S. from seven mostly Muslim countries, but lawmakers from both parties expressed strong concern or objection. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nOpponents point to the lack of instances of terrorism committed by refugees or foreign nationals from the countries Trump isolated. They also note countries such as Saudi Arabia aren't included, despite the fact that most of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers were Saudi citizens.\n\nBut there's no real way to measure the terrorism that these measures will prevent \u2014 if any. And given Trump's belief in sensationalized numbers when it comes to violence and crime in this country, it seems likely he'll believe he's thwarting plenty of very bad things.\n\nThe specter of terrorist attacks, violence and \u201ccarnage\u201d has always loomed large in Trump's rhetoric. And in our president, we have someone who isn't afraid of a black-and-white, us-vs.-them policy toward Islam and fighting terrorism. Trump ran an unapologetically nationalistic, \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign \u2014 rhetoric that he turned up to 11 in his inaugural address.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the idea that foreigners and/or Muslims are being unfairly targeted by this Trump policy isn't one that's likely to weigh heavily on him. And as with most of the controversies he's spawned, the backlash will probably only make him dig in.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "type": "article"}
