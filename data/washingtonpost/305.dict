Bannon. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nTHE MORNING PLUM:\n\nThe furor over President Trump\u2019s new immigration ban continues to grow, as Trump has now fired the acting attorney general for saying she questioned its legality and would not defend it in court. Faced with an international outpouring of opposition \u2014 including rising consternation among congressional Republicans \u2014 the measure\u2019s chief architect, Steve Bannon, has responded with a crescendo of bluster and defiance, blaming the controversy on out-of-touch media elites, which probably endears Bannon to Trump, who shows no public signs of budging.\n\nYet new reporting indicates that other members of Trump\u2019s team may be going wobbly about the ban, and that Republicans are coming to view the current situation as untenable. Axios reports this morning:\n\nRepublican sources tell us that the Department of Homeland Security may issue \u201cimplementation guidance\u201d that would allow for softening, and even policy changes, to President Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on migrants. The White House insists that any further guidance wouldn\u2019t constitute a walk-back. But the internal conversation, led by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, reflects the widespread view among top Republicans that the current chaotic situation \u2014 beset with blame-casting, backstabbing and unintended consequences \u2014 is untenable.\n\nThe important larger context here is that Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, has already made his dissatisfaction known about this executive order \u2014 leading to internal conflict with Bannon over it. Kelly was reportedly not briefed on the executive order until Trump was basically in the process of signing it. And DHS privately concluded that the ban did not legally apply to green card holders but was overruled by Bannon, who insisted that it did, because, well, because he said so. The White House subsequently reversed course on this point.\n\nTrump administration officials defended the president's executive order temporarily banning entry to the U.S. from seven mostly Muslim countries, but lawmakers from both parties expressed strong concern or objection. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nNow it appears that people at DHS \u2014 or Republicans who are allied with them \u2014 are letting it be known that the agency may put some kind of checks or limits on the policy, via \u201cimplementation guidance.\u201d The executive order would temporarily ban refugees and migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, and those challenging the order in court argue that, based on Trump\u2019s own campaign rhetoric about his desired \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d the intent of it is to replicate such a ban and discriminate against Muslims via legally permissible means.\n\n[Trump\u2019s firing of the acting attorney general sets a dangerous precedent]\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what any DHS effort to soften this via implementation guidance might look like. But one possibility is that DHS could employ the discretion to make exceptions to the executive order in individual cases.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to, DHS could in fact soften this to a certain degree,\u201d immigration attorney David Leopold says. \u201cThey could say that the executive order gives us the ability to decide on a case-by-case basis that it\u2019s in the national interest to let in some refugees or legal immigrants from these countries.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that such a \u201csoftening\u201d could be cosmetic. \u201cDHS could say that they are applying exceptions, to create the impression that they\u2019re being humanitarian, while in fact enforcing a complete ban, just as Trump wants,\u201d Leopold says.\n\nWhatever ends up happening, the core point here is that some senior members of Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 and some congressional Republicans \u2014 want to be seen distancing themselves from the substance and intent of this immigration ban, even though it is viewed by Bannon, the keeper of the eternal flame of Trumpism, as central to Trump\u2019s appeal to his voters. Bannon likes to argue that a massive silent majority of ordinary Americans is rooting for Trumpism \u2014 he has now declared that the current turmoil shows that a \u201cnew political order\u201d is being born before our eyes. According to Bannon, only out-of-touch coastal elites do not get what is happening. Putting aside the contempt this betrays for all the ordinary Americans who are horrified by this first iteration of Trumpism and are resisting it in various ways, the battle over the meaning of the political reaction to it will have important long term implications.\n\nThat\u2019s because there are still plenty of other fights ahead over immigration that will determine how far Trumpism gets in the real world. There is the possibility that Trump could extend this executive order or even expand it to include other countries. It is still not entirely clear what Trump has in mind for the hundreds of thousands of people brought here illegally as children. The degree to which Trump will expand deportations among millions of other undocumented immigrants remains to be seen. The revival of a registry for visitors from select countries remains a possibility. It is not hard to imagine that Trump might be tempted to ratchet some or all of these things up to 11 if there is a major terrorist attack.\n\n[Will backlash to Trump\u2019s travel ban paralyze the executive branch?]\n\nThus, the massive blowback greeting the current measure \u2014 and the fact that some Trump administration insiders and more reasonable Republicans are coming to see being associated with it as substantively, morally and politically untenable \u2014 will hopefully serve as an early warning of sorts. It might make them more reluctant to stand idly by as Bannon and his allies try to convert more of Trumpism\u2019s cruelest and ugliest impulses into reality.\n\n****************************************************************\n\n* WHY ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL REFUSED TO ENFORCE BAN: Monday night, acting attorney general Sally Yates was fired by Trump after she announced she would not defend his refugee ban in court. The Times explains her decision:\n\nMs. Yates \u2026 believed that the department had to consider the intent of the order, which she said appeared designed to single out people based on religion. Mr. Trump had campaigned on a promise to single out Muslims for immigration restrictions. \u2026 Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2026 said in an interview that Mr. Trump wanted a Muslim ban but needed \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d Mr. Trump said in a later interview \u2026 that Christian refugees would be given priority for entry visas to the United States.\n\nIndeed. And Trump himself has even discussed his Muslim ban and this sort of limitation on entry from Mideast countries as in effect the same proposal. The intent is obvious.\n\n* FIRING OF YATES SETS UP BIGGER FIGHT OVER SESSIONS: Bloomberg reports that Trump\u2019s decision to fire Yates gives Democrats a new line of questioning to press on Jeff Sessions before he\u2019s confirmed as Attorney General:\n\nSenate Republicans likely can clear Sessions\u2026with a final vote as early as Friday, if they turn quickly to address his confirmation. But Democrats say they want more time to question him, particularly over whether he\u2019d have the independence to stand up to Trump if he disagreed with the president. Democrats say that\u2019s what\u2026Yates did, and it cost her her job.\n\nNo doubt Senate Republicans will gladly give Dems more time to question the prospective chief law enforcement officer of the U.S. on a matter as important as whether he\u2019ll be independent of Trump.\n\n* TOP NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS KEPT IN DARK ABOUT BAN: The Associated Press reports:\n\nAt least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of the directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials.\n\nBut Steve Bannon knew about it \u2014 indeed, he had a heavy hand in writing it \u2014 and apparently, that\u2019s all that matters.\n\n* TRUMP\u2019S NONSTOP LIES STIR ALARM OVERSEAS: Mark Landler reports that foreign leaders and diplomats are watching Trump\u2019s endless lying and wondering how that might impact international relations:\n\nFrom defense treaties to trade pacts, foreign leaders are struggling to gauge whether they can depend on the United States to honor its commitments. They are sizing up a fickle president whose erroneous remarks on small issues cast doubt on what he might say on the big ones \u2014 the future of NATO, say, or the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 that involve war and peace.\n\nTrump is being unpredictable and disruptive. It\u2019s a brilliant, tremendous strategy, believe me.\n\n* BIGOTRY \u2018INFUSES\u2019 THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE: David Brooks ties Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees to his wall on the Mexican border:\n\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the aroma of bigotry infuses the whole operation, and anybody who aligns too closely will end up sharing in the stench. The administration could have simply tightened up the refugee review process and capped the refugee intake at 50,000, but instead went out of its way to insult Islam. The administration could have simply tightened up immigration procedures, but Trump went out of his way to pick a fight with all of Mexico.\n\nIt does sometimes seem as if creating the impression of a U.S. fight with Islam or Mexico is a feature, not a bug, of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n* AND TRUMP KEEPS DISSEMBLING ABOUT EXEC ORDER: Trump and the White House keep saying that \u201conly 109 people\u201d were impacted by the ban. Glenn Kessler sets the record straight:\n\nThe \u201c109\u201d number is old, and rather dubious. For instance, it does not reflect how many people were prevented from even boarding a plane\u2026.The real number is about 90,000. According to State Department statistics, that\u2019s how many people received either nonimmigrant or immigrant visas from the seven affected countries in fiscal year 2015.\n\nThe pointy-headed elite media fact-checkers just don\u2019t get this. \u201cAlternative facts\u201d cannot be fact-checked by definition.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "https://www.facebook.com/GregSargentWP/", "type": "article"}
