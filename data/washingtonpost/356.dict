(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nA group of lawyers and software developers wanted to find a 21st-century way to connect people flying into the United States from the countries affected by President Trump\u2019s contested travel ban with volunteer attorneys on the ground.\n\nAnd now, there\u2019s an app for that.\n\nAirportLawyer.org, a website whipped up by a team of programmers over the weekend while much of America was watching the Super Bowl, can link travelers landing at U.S. airports with free legal help to maneuver through whatever trouble they might find as they try to clear Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe app, which went live Monday, is being used by volunteer lawyers at airports including Baltimore-Washington International Marshall, Dulles International, Denver International and Seattle-Tacoma International, with other major airports expected to join.\n\nIn the turbulent days since Jan. 27, when Trump signed his executive order banning refugees and other travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 and before a federal judge issued a stay of the ban \u2014 thousands of people have been detained or have run into trouble clearing customs at U.S. airports.\n\nFree legal assistance is offered at Dulles International Airport on Sunday. (Astrid Riecken/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nThat has prompted volunteer lawyers to set up temporary shop at international-arrival terminals, working around the clock and waving placards announcing \u201cFree Lawyer.\u201d Most have no way of knowing who is arriving from countries affected by Trump\u2019s ban, except for information they gather in conversations with anxious family members nearby.\n\nThat dilemma spurred Seattle lawyers Greg McLawsen, Takao Yamada and Tahmina Watson to team up with software developers to create a tech solution: an app.\n\nAt AirportLawyer.org, travelers or their family members can upload personal information and travel plans, including arrival date, time and airport. That information is then securely shared with volunteer lawyers who can track the arrivals and meet the travelers.\n\n\u201cThose of us at the airport will know who\u2019s coming in, and we\u2019d be better prepared with information to work on their behalf,\u201d said Yamada, who has been volunteering his legal services at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He is also a co-founder of a Seattle tech start-up.\n\nWith the information that immigrants and other travelers provide through the website, volunteer lawyers may be better able to answer family members\u2019 questions about why, for example, an immigrant whose flight landed at noon hadn\u2019t cleared customs screening five hours later.\n\nThey may also be able to get word to Customs and Border Protection officers that attorneys are available to answer questions, provide documentation and find interpreters, if necessary, the lawyers say.\n\nTrump\u2019s ban left thousands of travelers stranded around the world. On Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart reversed Trump\u2019s order, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was set to hear arguments Tuesday evening.\n\nA decision \u2014 either way \u2014 could shake things up once again, McLawsen said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that through the rest of the week, while the stay is in place, people will be coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were one of them, I\u2019d be jumping on a plane right now.\u201d\n\nWhile Robart\u2019s order helped ease travel for many, lawyers say some clients still aren\u2019t being allowed to board airplanes overseas and are being detained for long stretches after arriving at U.S. airports.\n\nAmid all the uncertainty, McLawsen said, he received a message Friday from a colleague at Clio, a British Columbia-based legal-data-management company, asking how they might help.\n\nMcLawsen got in touch with Yamada, who had begun getting calls from worried family members and lawyers asking if he could use his contacts at the Seattle airport to check on one arriving passenger or another.\n\nClio then connected the lawyers with New York-based legal-software firm Neota Logic. The team worked over the weekend to create the app in 48 hours.\n\n\u201cTwo of the scariest things for people waiting at the airport are not knowing what\u2019s going on with their loved ones, and if something is going on, not knowing what to do about it,\u201d Yamada said. \u201cWe can help them find out and get them some help.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
