Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE MORNING PLUM:\n\nPresident Trump awakened this morning (if he slept at all last night) and decided it would be a good idea to seize on the London terror carnage to launch a fresh Twitter attack on the courts and on his own Justice Department. In so doing, he may have given opponents of his immigration ban more ammunition against it in court. Beyond that, he confirmed once again that a deep rot of bad faith and a profound contempt for process continue to infest much of what this administration does:\n\nPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nTrump also tweeted that \u201cextreme vetting\u201d is necessary to keep our country safe, and added that \u201cthe courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in now that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a lower court\u2019s temporary hold on the policy. The appeals court ruled that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in demonstrating on the merits that the travel ban is unconstitutional, because it violates the establishment clause and is motivated by an intent to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nJack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who served in various legal posts in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, told me in an email this morning that Trump\u2019s new tweets are \u201csignificant in at least two ways\u201d:\n\nFirst, they give atmospheric support to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, in the various immigration cases, that the immigration executive orders are motivated by invidious discrimination. Second, the attack on courts makes it much harder for courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule for Trump even when the law is otherwise on his side. Courts will want to avoid the appearance of having been bullied into ruling for Trump. The Trump tweets are thus entirely self-defeating for his litigation strategy, assuming he wants to win those cases.\n\nCould Trump\u2019s tweets undercut his administration\u2019s legal defense of the travel ban in some atmospheric sense? Trump made repeated campaign statements confirming his intent to ban Muslims from the United States. At one point he suggested an immigration ban by territory \u2014 which is now the basis for the current one he\u2019s pursuing by executive order banning travel from six majority-Muslim countries \u2014 would essentially be a way for him to get his originally intended ban around legal hurdles.\n\nThe appeals court cited Trump\u2019s own statements as proof of discriminatory intent, and ruled that precedent required it to weigh those statements if there was reason to believe that the president, in promulgating the ban, offered its rationale (national security) in \u201cbad faith.\u201d The government\u2019s lawyers had argued that Trump\u2019s own statements should not weigh on his expansive power to act in an immigration context in defense of the country, and that the courts should not go beyond the text of the executive order \u2014 which doesn\u2019t single out Muslims \u2014 in determining its muster. The Supreme Court will have to decide, among other things, whether those statements \u2014 made before Trump was president \u2014 should be relevant.\n\nAfter the rollout of President Trump's first travel ban, White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted \"it's not a travel ban,\" but rather is a vetting system, on Jan. 31. (The White House)\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets today contradict his own press secretary, Sean Spicer, who had previously insisted the executive order is not a \u201cban,\u201d but is solely a temporary pause only designed to facilitate the improvement of vetting processes. Trump appears to have confirmed that it is intended as a \u201cban\u201d with a few impulsive pokes of the Twitter \u201csend\u201d button. It\u2019s not clear this supports the argument that the ban was discriminatory in intent, but it does suggest in a more general way that the administration\u2019s rationales for the ban have been offered in bad faith.\n\nOmar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants Rights Project and one of the attorneys challenging the ban, told me that the legal team might incorporate Trump\u2019s latest tweets into its argument to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe tweets really undermine the factual narrative that the president\u2019s lawyers have been trying to put forth, which is that regardless of what the president has actually said in the past, the second ban is kosher if you look at it entirely on its own terms,\u201d Jadwat told me.\n\nCorey Brettschneider, a political science and constitutional law expert who helped author a brief against the ban, added that Trump\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpolitically correct\u201d suggested another layer of bad faith. The first version was also blocked by the courts, and Trump put forth the second one to pass legal muster. Trump is \u201ccriticizing his attorney general for convincing him to rewrite the policy,\u201d Brettschneider told me.\n\n\n\n(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)\n\nBeyond whether Trump\u2019s tweetstorm ends up having legal significance \u2014 which it might not \u2014 it shows once again that Trump\u2019s handling of the travel ban has been absolutely saturated with bad faith from the very beginning. Recall the back story here: An almost comically slapdash process went into producing the first travel ban. Then the administration delayed the second one to bask in good press from Trump\u2019s speech to Congress, even though it was supposed to be an urgent national security matter. On top of that, the substantive case for it was undercut by Homeland Security\u2019s own analysts in two leaked documents, yet \u201cnational security\u201d is still its stated substantive and legal rationale.\n\nNow Trump is openly ridiculing the idea that the second, \u201cpolitically correct\u201d version of the ban was designed to deal in a good-faith way with the courts\u2019 concerns about the first one. He\u2019s even attacking the Justice Department for its role in doing that. And in the wake of the London attack, he is renewing his pressure on the courts, suggesting their \u201cslowness\u201d is putting the nation at risk. As Goldsmith notes above, it is not impossible that this could make the high court more reluctant to grant Trump the broad latitude his administration is demanding \u2014 suggesting, once again, that Trump\u2019s own impulsive words and tweets are badly sapping credibility and could undermine his own agenda.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in interviews broadcast on June 4 that the Paris climate agreement hampered the U.S. economy. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n* TOP TRUMP ADVISERS SPLIT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: On Fox News Sunday, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt said Trump believes the \u201cclimate is changing,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t say whether human activity is a primary driver. But on CNN, U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump believes the climate is changing. And he believes pollutants are part of that equation \u2026 He knows that the U.S. has to be responsible with it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Just because we got out of a club doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t care about the environment.\u201d\n\nRemember, Sean Spicer tried to claim he hadn\u2019t had a chance to ask Trump the question. They can\u2019t get it straight on what Trump even believes \u2014 perhaps because he doesn\u2019t know himself.\n\n* TRUMP DISTORTS LONDON MAYOR\u2019S TERROR QUOTES: After the London terror attack, Trump tweeted that London Mayor Sadiq Khan claimed there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed.\u201d Khan said this:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners and bystanders enjoying their Saturday night \u2026 Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police and all of us need to do is make sure we\u2019re as safe as we possibly can be.\u201d\n\nOne wonders if the fact that Khan is Muslim helped induce Trump to do this.\n\n* GOP SENATOR RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT TRAVEL BAN: GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri talks some sense about Trump\u2019s immigration plan on Fox News, noting that the 90 days Trump wanted to put \u201cextreme vetting\u201d in place has already passed:\n\n\u201cMy view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting \u2026 It\u2019s been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.\u201d\n\nYes, but reviewing our vetting procedures without the ban wouldn\u2019t constitute an empty-but-vivid gesture showing Trump\u2019s supporters how tough he is on the Muslims. Duh!\n\n* TRUMP SABOTAGE COULD CAUSE PREMIUMS TO SOAR: The New York Times reports that Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is criticizing Trump\u2019s refusal to say whether he\u2019ll continue paying cost-sharing subsidies, which could cause the markets to melt down. Note this:\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty is extremely problematic,\u201d said Eric A. Cioppa, the superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance, who said carriers could not fix their rates without knowing the fate of those subsidies. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get a subsidy, I fully expect double-digit increases for three carriers on the exchanges here.\u201d\n\nAlso remember: The chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina has also pinned the blame for massive impending premium hikes directly on this Trump sabotage.\n\n* TRUMP\u2019S PARIS DISASTER IS TYPICAL OF GOP: Paul Krugman notes that Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris deal is driven by the same lies and climate denialism that the whole GOP has displayed, which is rooted in a broader GOP contempt for policy:\n\nToday\u2019s G.O.P. doesn\u2019t do substance; it doesn\u2019t assemble evidence, or do analysis to formulate or even to justify its policy positions. Facts and hard thinking aren\u2019t wanted, and anyone who tries to bring such things into the discussion is the enemy \u2026 Can you think of any major policy area where the G.O.P. hasn\u2019t gone post-truth?\n\nTrump has been more visibly crazy on climate, but many Republicans have employed all kinds of evasions on this issue for years, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) actively sought to undermine the Paris deal.\n\n* PARIS DECISION DRIVEN BY TRUMP\u2019S \u2018DIPLOMACY OF NARCISSISM\u2019: E.J. Dionne Jr. has a nice take on how Trump\u2019s Paris decision was driven not just by short-sighted nationalism, but by his own political self-interest as well:\n\nThis choice was partly driven by selfish political motives. This only reinforces how narrow a definition of self-interest is in play here. Trump seems to realize how much trouble he is in from the metastasizing Russia story. So he sought to appeal to his political base, shrunken though it is, by re-embracing his \u201cnationalist\u201d side. He said he\u2019d pull out of the Paris agreement and, by God, he did it! Doesn\u2019t that make him look strong?\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cAmerica First.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cTrump First.\u201d Before the rest of the planet.\n\n* AND THE GOP HAS A BRILLIANT STRATEGY FOR 2018: McClatchy reports that Republican officials are hatching a concerted strategy of making the news media the foil in the 2018 elections:\n\nThe hope, say these officials, is to convince Trump die-hards that these mid-term races are as much a referendum on the media as they are on President Trump. That means embracing conflict with local and national journalists, taking them on to show Republicans voters that they, just like the president, are battling a biased press corps out to destroy them \u2026 The strategists interviewed say they don\u2019t want their candidates imitating Republican candidate Greg Gianforte, who last month was charged with assaulting a reporter in Montana.\n\nOh. GOP strategists don\u2019t want their candidates physically assaulting members of the media as the candidates \u201cembrace conflict\u201d with them.
