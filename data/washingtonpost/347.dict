(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe flight from Dubai to Dulles International Airport took 15 hours. The whole way, Mustafa Aidid, 22, worried that he would not be permitted to enter the United States.\n\nBut there he was, walking bleary-eyed through the international arrivals gate Monday, one of several passengers turned away last week because of President Trump\u2019s far-reaching entry ban. They got a reprieve after a federal judge in Washington state blocked the executive order \u2014 at least temporarily.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I am so happy,\u201d Anab Ali said, wiping away a tear and wrapping her nephew in a hug. Aidid, a Somali citizen who was coming to the United States to marry his childhood sweetheart, held his aunt tight, saying nothing.\n\nOn the third day of the preliminary injunction against Trump\u2019s order, the scene at Dulles was one of angst and celebration. All day, as flights arrived from Dubai and Doha and Addis Ababa, clusters of immigrants carrying flowers or balloons reading \u201cWelcome Home\u201d waited anxiously and, eventually, erupted in cheers.\n\nIn addition to Aidid, there was Hassamedin Agabani, 35, who was supposed to emigrate from Sudan to the United States next week but sped up his departure after aides to Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told his mother, a Maryland resident, that he should get out while he could. There was Nabila Alhaffar, 26, a Syrian citizen who lives in Falls Church, Va., but found herself unable to return home last week from Qatar, where she had gone to visit her ailing mother.\n\nZahro Warsame of Louisville, Ky., second from right, has a moment with daughter Najmo Shakur, left, holding her child Mirhaan Kaafi, 3.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd there was Zahro Warsame, who had borrowed $2,625 to buy new plane tickets for her daughters and granddaughter after they were forced to stay in Ethiopia because of the ban.\n\nShe drove overnight from Lexington, Ky., with other family members, arriving at 5 a.m. Monday, hoping that this time her daughters would make it through.\n\n\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Warsame, who works at a chicken processing plant in Kentucky, said through an interpreter. She stared at the doorway through which travelers were arriving, at times clutching her headscarf over her mouth.\n\nAidid and his fiance, Hoda Abdi, met in the United Arab Emirates when they were toddlers. Their mothers were friends. When Abdi\u2019s family immigrated to the United States, she and Aidid lost touch. As they grew older, their families agreed that the two should be married. They were easy to persuade.\n\n\u201cSlowly, slowly, we started seeing each other outside and things took off from there,\u201d Aidid said.\n\nIn December, Aidid was approved for a K-1 temporary visa, which allows him to marry Abdi, a U.S. citizen. They were planning their wedding for June, giving him time to find a job, perhaps using his new degree in business administration. She is studying speech pathology.\n\nThen, last Wednesday, Aidid was turned away at Dubai International Airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. We had waited so long,\u201d he said.\n\nHe returned to the airport Sunday night. Although he boarded the plane without incident, he was convinced that someone would pull him off.\n\nAt Dulles, Aidid nervously moved through the U.S. Customs line. A federal agent read his paperwork, stamped the visa and waved him through. Then it was on to Ashburn, Va., to join his fiancee.\n\nWarsame\u2019s daughters moved to Ethiopia from Somalia about three years ago, after she immigrated to the United States.\n\nThe 18-year-old has a child who is 3. The other daughters are 16-year-old twins. All four were approved for family visas on Jan. 11, sponsored by another Warsame daughter, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nWhen they were turned away from their scheduled flight at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport last week, Warsame \u201cbasically gave up hope,\u201d said Luul Sheikh-Ali, a niece. \u201cWe were worried about her health.\u201d\n\nShe, Warsame and other relatives waited for hours Monday, long after the flight from Addis Ababa had landed.\n\n\u201cDid something else happen?\u201d Sheikh-Ali said.\n\nThe flood of passengers became a trickle. Warsame and her family were the last ones waiting near the baggage carousel. Finally, daughters and granddaughter appeared, and everyone wept.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle, because I never thought I\u2019d see my mother again,\u201d said Roodo Abdinasir, one of the twins.\n\nAsma Abdinasir, the other twin, breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cI still don\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
