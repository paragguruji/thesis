Giuliani arrives at Trump Tower in 2016. A federal judge in Michigan this week ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from the former New York mayor on the president\u2019s controversial travel ban. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA federal judge in Michigan this week ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from Rudolph W. Giuliani and other advisers on the president\u2019s controversial travel ban. Those suing over the matter hope the documents will bolster their bid to prove the ban was motivated by animus toward Muslims.\n\nGiuliani has been a key figure in the ban even before the first version was signed, and judges across the country have pointed to statements by the former New York mayor and close Trump ally as they have ordered the ban frozen. The judges have noted particularly a comment Giuliani made on Fox News in January, in which he seemed to suggest he helped the president craft a legal way to prevent Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\n\u201cSo when first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said at the time.\n\n[7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court]\n\nU.S. District Judge Victoria A. Roberts ordered the government to turn over to those suing a memo that Giuliani crafted, along with all \u201cdocuments or communications\u201d about the travel ban from him and several other Trump advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller during the period just before the election, before they were in their current roles.\n\nJudges have noted Miller\u2019s comments, too, in putting the latest version of the ban on hold.\n\n\u201cWe believe these documents will show exactly how the Muslim ban that Donald Trump called for on the campaign trail turned into the executive order he issued a week after taking office,\u201d said Miriam Aukerman, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, in a written statement. \u201cIf the administration now still refuses to turn over these papers, the question will be: What is it trying to hide?\u201d\n\nThe case in Michigan is not one of the two that have put Trump\u2019s latest travel ban on hold. It is proceeding at a slower pace and it could be significantly impacted by rulings elsewhere. On Monday, a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit Court is scheduled to hear arguments in one of those cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard arguments this week.\n\nIn an interview, Giuliani said he was willing to turn over whatever documents he still had \u2014 but he noted the court\u2019s order was directed to the government, not to him personally. \u201cBasically, the advice was you can\u2019t ban, based on any religion,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nGiuliani also said his comment on Fox News had been misinterpreted, and that Trump had not asked him how to craft a legal Muslim ban.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the incorrect interpretation,\u201d Giuliani said. He said Trump more accurately asked, \u201cwhat can he do legally to keep the country safe\u201d or \u201cHow can I do whatever I\u2019m going to do legally?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, what we told him is he shouldn\u2019t do a Muslim ban,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe way I interpreted it, it was, \u2018Tell me what I can do legally,\u2019 not, \u2018Tell me how I can get around and do a Muslim ban and find some kind of legal justification for it.\u2019 We did just the opposite.\u201d\n\nRoberts ordered the government to turn over Giuliani\u2019s memo by May 19 and the rest of the materials by June 2.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-05-13", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "turn", "trump", "ordered", "orders", "ban", "judge", "documents", "rudy", "michigan", "muslim", "york", "giuliani"], "summary": "Former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
