A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post)\n\nActing Attorney General Sally Yates has ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend challenges to President Trump\u2019s immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world, declaring in a memo Monday she is not convinced the order is lawful.\n\nYates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure the department\u2019s position is both \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote. She wrote that \u201cfor as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\u201d\n\nYates\u2019s view is perhaps unsurprising; she was second-in-command at the Justice Department under President Obama, held over until a new attorney general can be confirmed. Still, her announcement is remarkable for its defiance. It was not immediately clear who would defend the president\u2019s order in the Justice Department\u2019s place.\n\n[Trump has fired the acting attorney general who ordered Justice Dept. not to defend president\u2019s travel ban]\n\nThe Trump administration sought to stop former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about links between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on President Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), whose views align much more closely with the president\u2019s.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump continued on Monday to adamantly defend his order, despite mounting criticism, legal challenges and questions that stretched from Capitol Hill to the United Nations.\n\nTrump\u2019s order has sparked protests from coast to coast, court cases challenging its constitutionality, unease in cities worldwide and a host of questions about the limits of its scope. Even as the White House remained defiant, former president Barack Obama became the latest high-profile voice to weigh in on the issue, offering his first public criticism of his successor while backing protesters.\n\nThe ban\u2019s impact continued to reverberate around the world. The United Nations said that some 20,000 refugees could be affected by the 120-day suspension of refugee admission. Lawyers sought to confirm how many people remain detained in the United States, while a lawsuit argued that dozens of people may have been forced to give up their green cards by Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\n[Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented]\n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the situation at airports remains \u201cchaotic and fluid.\u201d Lawyers are \u201chaving trouble independently verifying anything because the government will not provide full access to all the detainees,\u201d he said.\n\nGelernt said that by Monday afternoon, no list of detainees had been turned over, adding that the ACLU could be back in court within a day to get the list so it could obtain more definitive information.\n\nOn Monday, in what could be the first volley in an intense legal battle, Bob Ferguson, Washington state\u2019s attorney general, said he plans to file a federal lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the order\u2019s implementation.\n\nFerguson is the first state official to declare plans to file such a suit, but he may not be the last. A day earlier, Ferguson joined 15 other state attorneys general in calling the measure unconstitutional. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who joined in that message, is reviewing possible options, \u201cand that could certainly include litigation,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman, said Monday.\n\n[Some international passengers entering the U.S. more easily, but members of Congress say they\u2019re still not getting answers]\n\nWhite House officials have played down the anger and chaos over the order, holding a briefing with reporters Sunday evening to argue that the rollout was \u201ca massive success story.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the ban and its implementation.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when the next attack\u2019s coming,\u201d he said during the briefing. \u201cAnd so the best you can do is to get ahead of it because if you wait, you\u2019re going to be reacting. And what I think I want to be clear on is the president\u2019s not going wait. He\u2019s going to make sure he does everything in his power when he can to protect the homeland and its people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order was followed by two days of intense protests at airport terminals across the country, meaning both weekends of his presidency so far have been marked by heavy public demonstrations against him. In his now-customary morning tweets, Trump blamed others for the disorganized implementation and sought to minimize its impact on travelers.\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cbig problems at airports\u201d were caused by the demonstrators themselves, an airline\u2019s technical problems and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who teared up while discussing the ban. (Delta Airlines suffered technical issues Sunday evening \u2014 48 hours after Trump signed the immigration order \u2014 that canceled about 150 flights.)\n\n\u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBig problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage\u2026..protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.\u201d\n\n1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.

Williamson/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nHours later, Obama \u2014 who had not weighed in on Trump since leaving office 10 days ago \u2014 endorsed the protests that have emerged nationwide and rejected his successor\u2019s attempt to link the travel ban to the Obama administration.\n\nObama feels \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, said in a statement. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d\n\nAlluding to Trump\u2019s questionable claim that his ban was based on Obama administration decisions, Lewis said the former president \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d\n\n[Scholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration]\n\nA group of former U.S. officials who served under presidents of both parties wrote a letter released to Politico asking the Trump administration to rescind the order, calling it \u201cinhumane, unnecessary and counterproductive from a security standpoint.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats sought to capitalize on the growing public outcry and said they were hoping to pass legislation rescinding the ban and planning to delay confirmation votes for Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. Some Republicans have also spoken out against the ban, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.), top defense hawks who issued a joint statement bluntly worrying that the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nCriticism also emerged in other quarters. State Department diplomats have been circulating a document objecting to Trump\u2019s order since he announced it Friday. According to a draft version of the memo, first reported by the Lawfare blog, the dissenters say the ban will not deter attacks on American soil, but will generate ill will toward U.S. citizens.\n\n[Jihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory]\n\nIraqi parliament leaders called for retaliatory visa restrictions on American citizens, while a petition called on Britain to cancel a planned state visit by Trump amid the furor.\n\nIn a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed concern about \u201cthe uncertainty facing thousands of refugees around the world who are in the process of being resettled to the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, more than 800 refugees were set to go to America this week but are barred, and the 120-day halt on refugee resettlement could impact as many as 20,000 refugees.\n\n\u201cRefugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process,\u201d the agency said.\n\n[Officials worry that U.S counterterrorism defenses will be weakened by Trump actions]\n\nIn airports around the world, sorrow and relief mixed together as travelers entered an unknown future. Trump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to travelers and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, lawyers and Democratic members of Congress were unable to get information from Customs officials. Late Sunday, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said he was told there were no people in Customs custody at Dulles.\n\nDozens of demonstrators gathered at Dulles to welcome international visitors, joining volunteer lawyers who gathered to monitor any potential problems.\n\n[Share your thoughts on the travel ban]\n\nCustoms agents at Dulles forced lawful permanent U.S. residents to give up their green cards this weekend, according to a complaint filed Monday in federal court in Alexandria. Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz were flying from Yemen to the United States. Both had been granted immigrant visas because their father, who lives in Flint, Mich., is a U.S. citizen.\n\nWhen they arrived at Dulles Saturday morning, the Aziz brothers were handcuffed and their immigration paperwork was seized, according to the complaint.\n\nThey were given documents to sign and allegedly told that if they did not, they would be removed from the United States and barred from coming back for five years. They were not allowed to see attorneys.\n\nUnder pressure, their attorneys said, they signed documents they did not understand, giving up their American visas, and agents stamped \u201ccancelled\u201d on those visas. Attorneys are asking for their visas to be returned, the forms they signed to be invalidated and for them to be returned to the United States.\n\nAttorneys said they believe it is possible that many of 50 to 60 other legal permanent residents at Dulles were likewise tricked into giving up their status there. The lawyers said they hope to learn the identities of those individuals through the discovery process.\n\nThe Aziz brothers were compelled to buy tickets, at their own expense, for a flight back to Ethiopia, and when they arrived, their passports were confiscated, leaving them in limbo.\n\nAnthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said anyone with a valid visa should be able to enter the United States, even if they are abroad, and the ACLU is working to investigate reports that this is not happening.\n\nIn the long run, Romero said, ACLU lawyers will work to get the executive order thrown out permanently, and they will seek to have its implementation delayed while they press their case. This court battle could take years, he said.\n\nRomero said they believe the executive order violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, some ratified treaties and \u2014 perhaps most acutely \u2014 the First Amendment, because it seems to target Muslims. The order\u2019s exception for those from minority religions in majority-Muslim countries \u201cis clearly the smoking gun that this has targeted individuals of the Muslim faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat dooms it from a First Amendment perspective, in our view,\u201d Romero said.\n\nThe Council on American\u2010Islamic Relations on Monday filed a sweeping challenge to the executive order, alleging its \u201cpurpose is to initiate the mass expulsion of immigrant and non-immigrant Muslims lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit lists 27 plaintiffs, some of them activists and council officials and others students with visas, lawful permanent residents, refugees and others who allege Trump\u2019s order will deny them citizenship or prevent them from traveling abroad and returning home.\n\n[Here\u2019s where Republicans stand on the travel ban]\n\nAmong them is a doctor who the suit alleges is working in an underserved area in the United States.\n\n\u201cIn the event he is prevented from returning to the United States, the area he serves will be lacking an essential physician to provide critical care to a substantial population in the United States,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nGadeir Abbas, who joined with others to file the suit, said the lawyers are \u201cconfident that we can win, and fortunately, President Trump and those around him make it very easy to reveal that bigotry. They can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials said the executive order does apply to green-card holders, who may be let into the country with a waiver. The directors of each large port of entry, such as airports, have the authority to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a green-card holder may be admitted.\n\nSince Friday, dozens of green-card holders at large airports in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been admitted, officials said. The officials also said Friday\u2019s confusion has abated in these large airports because people subject to the ban are not being permitted to board flights overseas and so are not arriving at American airports.\n\nIn Seattle, two men whose visas were revoked and who were put on plane to be deported were allowed to enter the United States after a federal judge issued an emergency ruling in their favor, said Matt Adams, the men\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAdams said the men \u2014 one an engineer from Sudan who was coming to the United States for a conference, the other a visitor from Yemen who was coming to see family \u2014 \u201cliterally had to get pulled off the plane as they were deporting them.\u201d\n\nThe men dropped their lawsuit after they were allowed to enter the United States, Adams said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is now with the national stay in effect, if anyone were to arrive, then the government\u2019s precluded from trying to immediately deport them like they were doing on Saturday,\u201d Adams said.\n\nHowever, Adams said more lawsuits were likely, noting the number of people getting stopped as they tried to board planes abroad.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter that Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly \u201csaid that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\u201d In other messages, Trump again cast his order as necessary to protect the country:\n\nThere is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nThe seven countries under Trump\u2019s ban do not include several that have been tied to terrorists involved in major attacks or attempted plots in the United States.\n\nWhite House officials through the weekend and Monday continued to justify the ban by citing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Boston Marathon bombing and San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage. None of these attacks involved people born in countries listed on the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order to halt U.S. entry for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals for 120 days starting Jan. 27. Fiery protests and lawsuits made for a tumultuous weekend. Here's what you need to know.
