Christensen, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement that it had \u201cnot been subject to the extensive interagency review process required of finished intelligence products\u201d and did not \u201cinclude data from other intelligence community sources.\u201d She confirmed there was debate over the matter, as CNN reported, but disputed that debate was because of political concerns.\n\n\u201cAllegations by opponents of the president\u2019s policies that senior DHS intelligence officials would politicize intelligence is unfortunate and untrue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dispute with this product was over sources and quality, not politics.\u201d\n\nShanez Tabarsi, right, is greeted by her daughter Negin at Logan Airport in Boston after traveling to the U.S. from Iran following a federal court's temporary stay of Trump's executive order travel ban.

Here\u2019s why that number keeps changing.]\n\nThe report is three pages long and does not address head-on whether the temporary ban on people entering the United States from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Libya is an effective measure. But it asserts that citizens from those countries are \u201crarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism,\u201d and citizenship itself is an \u201cunreliable indicator of terrorist threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nBased on an analysis of Justice Department press releases, it says of 82 people \u201cwho died in the pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorism-related federal offense,\u201d more than half were U.S.-born citizens.\n\nThe report referenced eight people from Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Yemen who it said were convicted of or died in pursuit of terrorism. It said none had done so from Syria and did not specifically mention Libya. It also excluded those merely traveling or attempting to travel to join a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe report also concludes that while terror groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat of attacks in the United States, the other four countries are \u201cregionally focused.\u201d That conclusion is based on another, non-classified report.\n\nTrump has said he plans to re-write his executive order \u2014 which courts have ordered frozen \u2014 and a White House official has said the new version is expected next week. Those suing over the matter said the original order represents an unconstitutional targeting of Muslims, disguised as a national security measure. In one court case, 10 former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials attached their names to an affidavit declaring there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries, which are all Muslim-majority.\n\nThe new report could prove a boon to those challenging Trump\u2019s ban, as they seek to demonstrate it was motivated not by national security concerns, but by religious animosity. They also will likely be able to use as evidence comments by Trump himself and ally Rudy Giuliani suggesting the administration wanted to ban Muslims from entering the United States.\n\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nThough not addressing that directly, Christensen offered a defense of the ban\u2019s national security purpose.\n\n\u201cThe seven countries were identified by the previous administration as being countries of concern for foreign terrorist travel to the Unites States. Consequently, these countries were the focus of this administration\u2019s initial efforts to enhance vetting for foreign travel to the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-24", "source": "washingtonpost", "top_words": ["travel", "casts", "trump", "national", "ban", "intelligence", "security", "report", "terrorist", "united", "need", "dhs", "countries", "states", "doubt"], "summary": "(Brian Snyder/Reuters)[The government now says 746 people were held due to the travel ban.\nThose suing over the matter said the original order represents an unconstitutional targeting of Muslims, disguised as a national security measure.\n(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)Though not addressing that directly, Christensen offered a defense of the ban\u2019s national security purpose.\n\u201cThe seven countries were identified by the previous administration as being countries of concern for foreign terrorist travel to the Unites States.\nConsequently, these countries were the focus of this administration\u2019s initial efforts to enhance vetting for foreign travel to the United States,\u201d she said."}
