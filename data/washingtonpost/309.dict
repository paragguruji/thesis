Here\u2019s what happened over the past three days.\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked enforcement of the ban nationwide, allowing travelers previously barred from entering the country to board U.S.-bound planes. Trump, as you might expect, was not happy with the decision, and he used Twitter to criticize the judge who made it. \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d he tweeted Saturday morning.\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nOn Saturday night, lawyers for the Trump administration filed a notice to appeal the decision. On Sunday, a federal appeals court ruled against the government, saying the immigration ban will remain suspended for now. Monday and Tuesday are expected to see more action as lawyers for both sides file written arguments. After that, the court could schedule a hearing or rule whether the ban should remain suspended. And the developments won\u2019t stop there: Remember, this is just one of the many legal battles springing up over Trump\u2019s ban across the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump\u2019s criticism of U.S. District Judge James L. Robart as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d continues to reverberate, drawing rebuke from some Republicans.\n\nVice President Pence on Feb. 5 defended President Trump's travel ban while senators questioned Trump's criticism of the federal judge who temporarily blocked the ban. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t understand language like that,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said Sunday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges, we don\u2019t have so-called senators, we don\u2019t have so-called presidents.\u201d\n\nTRUMP RAISES EYEBROWS WITH STRONG DEFENSE OF PUTIN\n\nThe other matter distancing Trump from would-be Republican allies is Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump mounted a strong defense of Putin over the weekend during an interview with Fox News, even attempting to neutralize host Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s description of Putin as a \u201ckiller.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of killers,\u201d Trump said, seeming to equate the United States with Russia. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nVice President Pence and senators of both political parties on Feb. 5 reacted to President Trump's comments about Russia and the United States in a Fox News interview. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rejected any comparison in a separate interview Sunday, calling Putin a \u201cformer KGB agent\u201d and a \u201cthug.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think America is exceptional. America is different,\u201d McConnell said on CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t operate in any way the way the Russians do. I think there\u2019s a clear distinction here that all Americans understand, and no, I would not have characterized it that way.\u201d\n\nAs for Vice President Pence, he once again found himself veering from Trump on the question of Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019re very troubled by the increased hostilities over the past week,\u201d he said on ABC.\n\nPENCE TO LEAD VOTING INVESTIGATION, TRUMP SAYS\n\nFurthermore, Trump still believes \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that 3 to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote in his election battle against Hillary Clinton. Now, after promising an investigation, he announced who is going to run it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to set up a commission \u2026 headed by Vice President Mike Pence, and we\u2019re going to look at it very, very carefully,\u201d Trump told Fox News.\n\nTrump described the alleged problem like this: \u201cWhen you see people that are registered in two states, that have voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals, people that are not citizens, and they are on the registration rolls.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for voters to be on rolls in more than one state.\n\nTRUMP STILL BENEFITING FROM BUSINESS, DOCUMENTS SHOW\n\nEthics experts urged Trump to set up a blind trust to protect himself against conflicts of interest while in office. And he has set up a trust, but he is much closer to it than those experts would like. According to newly released documents, Trump is the sole beneficiary of the trust created to separate him from his business. The trust is legally controlled by his oldest son and a longtime employee. Trump also retains the legal power to revoke the trust at any time, the documents show.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive for the 60th annual Red Cross Gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nEducation secretary nominee Betsy DeVos is scheduled to receive a floor vote Tuesday, and she has no support to spare after Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) said they would oppose her confirmation. Democrats are hoping they can peel off one pro-DeVos vote and sink her nomination, but it\u2019s unclear whom they could turn at this point. The White House says it\u2019s confident DeVos will be confirmed.\n\nNext up to receive floor votes \u2014 though none has been scheduled yet \u2014 are attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), health and human services secretary nominee Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) and treasury secretary nominee Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nAlso on the calendar for this week is a Tuesday vote in the Committee on Veterans Affairs for VA secretary nominee David Shulkin.\n\nCheck out the full schedule here, and follow the author @eliseviebeck.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
