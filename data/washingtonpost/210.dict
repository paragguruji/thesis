The government has estimated there are about 24,000 refugees with formal assurances.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch\u2019s duty to protect the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe ruling does not get to the heart of whether the travel ban is lawful. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on that next month. And given that the measure was supposed to have been temporary \u2014 90 days for citizens of the six countries affected by the ban and 120 days for refugees \u2014 it is also possible that the dispute will be moot by then.\n\nIn the 9th Circuit, the parties had essentially been arguing over who could be excluded from entering the United States after the justices in June ruled that a limited version of the travel ban could take effect.\n\nThe high court had said officials could not enforce the measure on those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States, but offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify.\n\n\u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d The same standard applied to citizens of the six countries affected by the ban \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 as well as all refugees.\n\n[Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall]\n\nThe government initially sought to block grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the country from entering, along with refugees with formal assurance letters from resettlement agencies, but a U.S. district judge ultimately prevented the government from doing so. The Supreme Court then put on hold the portion of that district judge\u2019s ruling on refugees, but not on grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States. That led to the legal wrangling before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nThe 9th Circuit judges wrote that the government had not offered persuasive evidence that grandparents and other extended relatives did not count as \u201cclose\u201d family members, rejecting the government\u2019s argument that they had drawn their position from immigration law. They rejected similar arguments on refugees with assurances.\n\nThe 9th Circuit opinion was written by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez, all appointed by President Bill Clinton.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-07", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.zapotosky", "type": "article"}
