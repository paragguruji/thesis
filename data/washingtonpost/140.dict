(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nAccording data provided by the associatation, which represents corporate travel managers and travel service professionals, business travel transaction levels increased by 1.2 percent the week prior to the announcement of the executive order, but decreased 2.2 percent the week following the announcement of the ban. The association said that in 2016, 87.3 percent of U.S. business travel was domestic; 12.7 percent was international travel.\n\nAn earlier survey of GBTA\u2019s U.S. members found that about three in 10 expected to see a reduction in business travel over the next three months. Roughly the same percentage said the ban could affect travel for the next six months and beyond. A second survey of international members found they were evenly split on whether the ban would have an immediate impact on travel. The surveys, however were conducted before a U.S. District Judge temporarily halted its implementation allowing travelers and refugees to continuing entering the U.S.\n\nThe longer the debate continues the more difficult it will be for the industry, McCormick said.\n\n\u201cThe cloud of uncertainty could leave a lasting economic impact,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge corporations and small businesses alike will suffer. The biggest driver of our economic recovery of the past seven years from the most recent downturn was international outbound travel.\u201d\n\n[After assailing \u2018obsolete\u2019 airports and transportation system, Trump tells airline execs he\u2019s here to help]\n\nTrump met with airline executives Thursday where he they discussed the need to upgrade and modernize the nation\u2019s airports and air traffic control system.
