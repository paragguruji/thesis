Giuliani said President Trump wanted a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and requested he assemble a commission to show him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, an early Trump supporter who once had been rumored for a Cabinet position in the new administration, appeared on Fox News late Saturday night to describe how Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees came together.\n\nTrump signed orders on Friday not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 is suspended for 90 days. Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nFox News host Jeanine Pirro asked Giuliani whether the ban had anything to do with religion.\n\n\u201cHow did the president decide the seven countries?\u201d she asked. \u201cOkay, talk to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Giuliani responded eagerly. \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' \"\n\nGiuliani said he assembled a \u201cwhole group of other very expert lawyers on this,\u201d including former U.S. attorney general Michael Mukasey, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Tex.) and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cAnd what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger \u2014 the areas of the world that create danger for us,\u201d Giuliani told Pirro. \u201cWhich is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear when the phone call Giuliani took place and when the commission began working. An email to the White House press office was not immediately returned Sunday.\n\n[Meet the rookie federal judge who halted Trump\u2019s refugee deportations \u2014 to save a Syrian]\n\n1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Protest at New York\u2019s JFK airport against Trump\u2019s order halting refugee admissions View Photos Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) called out Giuliani's interview with Pirro from the night before.\n\n\u201cThey can't deny that this is a Muslim ban,\u201d Ellison told Dickerson. \u201cOn the campaign trail, [Trump] said he wanted a Muslim ban. ... Rudolph W. Giuliani who helped him write it said that they started out with the intention of a Muslim ban and then they sort of 'languaged' it up so to try to avoid that label, but it is a religiously based ban.\u201d\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered at the arrivals gate of Washington Dulles International Airport to push back against President Trump's executive order that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a news conference Sunday morning, noting later that his middle name, Ellis, was originally inspired by Ellis Island.\n\n\u201cIt was implemented in a way that created chaos and confusion across the country, and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe those that will do us harm,\u201d Schumer added of the ban. \u201cIt must be reversed immediately.\u201d\n\nTrump's executive order sparked massive protests at airports around the country Friday and Saturday, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders, were being detained.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Saturday morning challenging Trump\u2019s order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nAs Giuliani was speaking, Fox News simultaneously aired an alert that noted federal judge Ann M. Donnelly had issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide.\n\nDonnelly wrote that there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 Executive Order,\u201d Donnelly wrote.\n\n[Senate Democrats vow legislation to block Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nThe ACLU hailed the victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d ACLU executive director Anthony D.

On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying it did not plan to back off enforcing Trump's orders.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the statement read. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\u201d\n\nThe department said that less than 1 percent of daily international air travelers to the United States had been \u201cinconvenienced\u201d on Saturday.\n\n[Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban even as others defend it]\n\nMatthew Kolken, an immigration attorney based in Buffalo said there has been \u201ca systemic bias against individuals from Muslim countries in the U.S. immigration departments\u201d for years, including under the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis isn't unprecedented,\u201d Kolken told The Washington Post by phone Sunday. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is the executive branch does have vast discretionary authority to determine who they are going to [allow in or not].\u201d\n\nStill, Kolken said, he believes \u201cTrump has gone a step further without a doubt\u201d in including even people who are lawful permanent residents and suspending all immigration applications from people from the seven countries on the banned list.\n\nIf there was evidence of disparate treatment of individuals from the same country \u2014 if there were anecdotal evidence of, for example, a Syrian family of one religious background allowed to enter over that of another religious background \u2014 then that is where lawsuits could come into play, he said.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes whether they're trying to do an end-around by couching the ban as a country-specific ban based on a security-related issues when in reality it's a religious ban,\u201d Kolken said.\n\n1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.
