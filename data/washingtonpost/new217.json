(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country has created political turmoil, protest, and confusion for air travelers around the globe.\n\nAmid all the tumult, even some travel experts and travelers\u2019 advocates have been struggling to provide insight and guidance in a quickly changing situation. The original order \u2013 which has been the subject of legal challenges \u2014 has undergone changes in the way it\u2019s been enforced. Meanwhile, airlines have been working to comply with the directive and some, such as United, American Airlines, and others, have taken steps to accommodate affected travelers by refunding and rebooking flights.\n\nSo what will the impact be on tourism and travel? What rights do travelers have? And what should you expect now if you\u2019re traveling overseas?\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Charles Leocha, president of Travelers United, a Washington nonprofit organization that advocates for airline passengers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the problem. The way it was crafted, we have a presidential directive that didn\u2019t take into account a lot of unintended consequences, and now they\u2019re dealing with a lot of unintended consequences piece by piece.\u201d\n\n[Here\u2019s why airlines were scrambling after Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nLeocha said such chaos should have been predictable given the nature of sudden policy shifts on a complex subject. Even travel-related legislation and policies that undergo years of debate and development often contain unforeseen problems once they go into effect.\n\nInitially, the president\u2019s order caused U.S. permanent residents who hold green cards to be halted from entry, but that\u2019s since been lifted, and the military has put together lists of people from the affected countries who have been working with the services and have been vetted for entry, he said.\n\nAirlines for America, an industry trade organization, says through a spokesman Tuesday that the industry remains committed to the well-being of all its customers and has been working diligently to accommodate travelers affected by the ban. Airlines have also been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in seeking to comply with the executive order.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we are not seeing any significant operational impact to the system,\u201d A4A spokesman Vaughn Jennings said in an email.\n\nLeocha\u2019s best advice for U.S. travelers is to sign up for Global Entry, a program of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that\u2019s similar to the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) PreCheck program. Global Entry can take a few months to obtain, Leocha said, but it allows people expedited movement through passport and customs controls, and that could come in handy for the next few months until questions about Trump\u2019s order are sorted out.\n\n\u201cSomething tells me the lines are going to be a mess for at least the next 90 days,\u201d Leocha said. \u201cWhen I land at JFK and there\u2019s a 45 minute wait to get through passports, basically, it takes me about 45 seconds to go through. It\u2019s like magic,\u201d he said referring to Global Entry.\n\nPaul Hudson, president of Flyersrights.org, said the biggest impact on travelers could come when and if other countries react to the U.S. ban with stricter travel policies of their own. That\u2019s what happened after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when the United States imposed stricter visa and entry rules on foreign nationals. Other countries retaliated by making it harder and more expensive for U.S. citizens to obtain visas, Hudson said.\n\n\u201cThere will be some blowback from certain countries,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWhen people travel abroad, there\u2019s an assumption that with an American passport you can pretty much go anywhere. But more and more countries require Americans to have visas.\u201d\n\nHudson also said that it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that Trump\u2019s order will depress tourism and travel.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s going to be a big drop from countries represented in this order, but that only represents 13 percent of the world\u2019s Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be many others that just decide they don\u2019t feel welcome coming here and they don\u2019t want to come.\u201d\n\nRead more of Tripping:\n\n[Trump was among record numbers taking a gun through TSA checkpoint]\n\n[Uber drivers earn about $15.68 an hour but disparities are significant, survey finds]\n\n[Virginia bill addresses the scourge of drunken Segway drivers on roads.
