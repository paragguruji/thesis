Larry Hogan was the target of a protest Saturday by demonstrators who want him to take a hard line against President Trump\u2019s policies. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered Saturday in Annapolis outside the residence of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, demanding that he wield his status as a Republican governor of a moderate state to condemn President Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominations as well as his order temporarily banning the entry of citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries as well as refugees.\n\nChanting \u201cShame, shame, shame!\u201d protesters held signs with messages such as \u201cHogan, we\u2019re WATCHING YOU!\u201d and \u201cYour silence is deafening,\u201d according to videos posted online. On Twitter, the rally gained momentum with the hashtag #WhereIsHogan.\n\nIn an interview, one of the rally\u2019s organizers said that more than 400 people attended, including two state senators. In addition to the travel ban, the crowd rallied against Trump\u2019s choice of education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and chanted its support for the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hogan is particularly well placed to call on Donald Trump to stop these actions. This state is against what Trump is doing, and he hasn\u2019t said anything. It\u2019s actually been incredible,\u201d said Kyle Lierman of Silver Spring, a former senior policy adviser in the Obama administration who helped plan the event.\n\nLierman, whose sister is Maryland Del. Brooke E. Lierman (D-Baltimore), said that demonstrators rallied in front of the governor\u2019s official residence on Lawyer\u2019s Mall from noon to 2 p.m. but that Hogan made no appearance. Lierman said protesters included some of his former White House colleagues.\n\nHogan\u2019s office released a statement that said the governor \u201cis focused on making a better place to live, work, and raise a family. We look forward to seeing these same groups support the administration\u2019s common sense and bipartisan initiatives, including legislation to strengthen our ethics laws, aid in the fight against heroin, and create thousands of jobs for Maryland\u2019s hardworking citizens.\u201d\n\nRegarding the travel ban, his office said, \u201cThe governor appreciates and supports actions to make America safer, but it must be done in a manner consistent with American values.\u201d\n\nProminent state Democrats \u2014 including Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) \u2014 have condemned Trump\u2019s actions and have been calling on Hogan to follow suit, but they have been met mostly with silence. Late last month, after Trump issued the travel ban,spokeswoman Amelia Chasse released a statement saying that the governor\u2019s legal counsel was reviewing the president\u2019s executive order and that Hogan \u201clikes to get the facts before he comments.\u201d\n\n[Maryland Democrats press Hogan on Trump\u2019s travel ban]\n\nLierman recently posted a petition on the MoveOn.org website calling on Hogan to rebuke Trump\u2019s ban, attracting more than 800 signers.\n\nSome demonstrators took part because the ban hits home. Hena Zuberi, the editor in chief of \u00adMuslimmatters.org and a reporter for the Muslim Link newspaper, lives in College Park but was born in Pakistan and raised in Sudan. After Trump\u2019s executive order, the State Department revoked nonimmigrant and immigrant visas of nationals from seven countries, Sudan among them. The others were Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Libya. A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary restraining order to stop the ban, but the Justice Department has indicated that it will fight the order.\n\nZuberi, who came to the United States as a 17-year-old to attend Wellesley College and graduated from the University of New Orleans, said Hogan\u2019s silence has been hurtful.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be politics as usual. He needs to address his constituents \u2014 these are people from all parts of society,\u201d said Zuberi, who is now a U.S. citizen. Citing the president\u2019s remarks about U.S. District Judge James L. Robart, who temporarily halted enforcement of Trump\u2019s travel ban, she added: \u201cWhen Trump calls a federal judge a \u2018so-called\u2019 judge? It shakes the confidence in our checks and balances.\u201d", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": "http://www.facebook.com/ianshapira", "type": "article"}
