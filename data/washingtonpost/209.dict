(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)\n\nThe Post reports how grossly diminished is the new ban, which the usually publicity-hungry President Trump signed out of camera range, and will not take effect for 10 days:\n\nPresident Trump signed a new travel ban Monday that administration officials said they hope will end legal challenges over the matter by imposing a 90-day ban on the issuance of new visas for citizens of six majority-Muslim nations, authorities said. In addition, the nation\u2019s refu\u00adgee program will be suspended for 120 days, and it will not accept more than 50,000 refugees in a year, down from the 110,000 cap set by the Obama administration. The new guidelines mark a dramatic departure from Trump\u2019s original ban. They lay out a far more specific national security basis for the order, block the issuance of only new visas, and name just six of the seven countries included in the first executive order, omitting Iraq. The order also details specific sets of people who would be able to apply for case-by-case waivers to the order, including those previously admitted to the United States for \u201ca continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity,\u201d those with \u201csignificant business or professional obligations\u201d and those seeking to visit or live with family.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the reaction from opponents in a moment, but consider this is a mere shadow of Trump\u2019s original plan to \u201cban all Muslims.\u201d Iraq is off the list, as are a slew of other potential visitors. (\u201cThe new order provides other exceptions not contained explicitly in previous versions: for travelers from those countries who are legal permanent residents of the United States, dual nationals who use a passport from another country and those who have been granted asylum or refu\u00adgee status. It removes an exception to the refu\u00adgee ban for members of religious minority groups \u2014 which critics had pointed to as evidence the first ban was meant to discriminate against Muslims \u2014 and it no longer imposes an indefinite prohibition on travelers from Syria.\u201d)\n\nThat does not mean it will now pass constitutional muster, but it shows how egregious was the first order and how preposterous it is to say that the new order protects us from real dangers. It is both overly inclusive (where\u2019s the evidence that these countries are the source of the threat?) and under-inclusive (why not ban, for example, countries which have produced scores of violent terrorists \u2014 from Belgium to Saudi Arabia?). Not a single country that is not a majority-Muslim country appears on the list. There is still no rationale for suspending all refugees, who are the most thoroughly vetted immigrants. The ban is, in a word, irrational; it serves no coherent purpose other than to appease Trump and his Islamophobic supporters. Under even a low level of constitutional scrutiny, it may fail to meet the \u201crational basis\u201d test.\n\nOpponents of the original ban see the narrower version as embodying the same fatal flaws that afflicted the first version. The American Civil Liberties Union declared, \u201cThe only way to actually fix the Muslim ban is not to have a Muslim ban. Instead, President Trump has recommitted himself to religious discrimination, and he can expect continued disapproval from both the courts and the people.\u201d Its written statement added, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the changes the Trump administration has made, and everything we\u2019ve learned since the original ban rolled out, completely undermine the bogus national security justifications the president has tried to hide behind and only strengthen the case against his unconstitutional executive orders.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez blasted the decision. \u201cThis second Muslim ban is just as unconstitutional as the last one and it isn\u2019t making us any safer. A memo leaked by Trump\u2019s own Department of Homeland Security flatly contradicts his unfounded claim that citizens of the countries targeted are more likely to pose a terrorist threat. A number of terrorism experts opposed to this ban have also made it clear that it only fuels radicalization and extremism, increasing the likelihood of terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nLike many Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin (Md.) took issue in particular with the mean-spirited and unnecessary ban on refugees:\n\nThere is a real threat that this nation faces from terrorism, and our policy efforts must address that threat. This order does not do that. Instead, it makes us less safe, damages our moral leadership, and strengthens the hand of those who would do us harm either through recruitment or self-radicalization. . . . Refugees entering the United States are rigorously vetted through a long process involving thorough checks by multiple security agencies, and any needed changes can continue to be made without suspending the entire process. A four-month ban will in effect disrupt resettlement for months longer because refugees\u2019 required medical and security clearances will lapse. I fear the Administration\u2019s continued targeting of the refugee program signals their wish to permanently curtail or end what has been for generations a hallmark of American security and moral leadership across the world.\n\nCritic make a strong case that new ban is unwise, provides Islamist jihadists with the same propaganda victory as the old ban (i.e. the United States is at war with Islam), damages our relations with Muslim allies and distracts us from the more acute threats. Whether it now is so narrowly crafted as to avoid obvious constitutional maladies remains to be seen. (It will, for example, be harder to argue that those affected have due process rights). Nevertheless, as the pro-immigration reform group America\u2019s Voice declared, \u201cThe ban remains a cruel, chaotic, and dangerous affront to the principles our country was founded on. Trump\u2019s cynical handling of this entire effort has shown just how reckless and manipulative he\u2019s willing to be \u2014 with our nation\u2019s security and our nation\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nThe new ban is the perfect symbol of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 irrational, inhumane, ineffective and damaging to the United States\u2019 international credibility. Meanwhile, he has not produced military plans or diplomatic initiatives that might actually make us safer. He won\u2019t be able to blame the courts or his political opponents if and when the next terrorist incident occurs.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
