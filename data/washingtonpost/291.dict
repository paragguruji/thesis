Tell us what you plan to do next.]\n\nWhether this bad policy is unconstitutional, or even illegal, however, is a different issue \u2014 and not an easy one.\n\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe basic problem facing the various states and private plaintiffs now flocking to federal court is that the president enjoys extremely wide authority over immigration matters.\n\nUnder the 1980 Refugee Act, the president decides how many refugees the United States will resettle on U.S. soil each year, which is why President Barack Obama could crank the target up from 85,000 in fiscal 2016 to 110,000 in fiscal 2017.\n\nTrump\u2019s order invokes an even broader statutory provision that allows the president to restrict or suspend the entry of \u201cany aliens or . . . any class of aliens\u201d whose admission he deems \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d for pretty much as long as he thinks is necessary.\n\nHistorically, courts have been deferential toward presidents\u2019 exercise of this authority, both because Congress\u2019s delegation is so clear and because of the judicial branch\u2019s traditional, and usually well-founded, reluctance to weigh in on matters affecting foreign affairs and national security.\n\nThe still-forming constitutional case against Trump\u2019s order does not, therefore, deny his broad power. The argument would be that he has abused it \u2014 exercised it in violation of the religious freedom clause of the First Amendment \u2014 by imposing criteria that disfavor Muslims and favor Christians, without showing any actual connection to a policy goal, or making any attempt to achieve that goal though less restrictive alternatives.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be an across-the-board blunderbuss,\u201d says David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThis amounts to a demand that courts flunk Trump\u2019s order under the doctrine of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d that applies to potentially discriminatory measures in the domestic arena.\n\nThe problem is that they have never said anything like that before regarding immigration. To be sure, Trump\u2019s own prejudiced remarks about Muslims undermine his claim to be acting rationally and impartially in the national interest. It will certainly be interesting to watch administration lawyers try to defend their boss\u2019s words, or explain them away, when judges start grilling them in open hearings.\n\nHowever, the fact that the order is only temporary, and could result in nothing more than tweaked procedures, could mitigate that ugly history; what\u2019s more, the actual text makes no reference to Muslims per se.\n\nTrump has made it plain in various comments that he intends to help Christians toward whom, he alleges, the previous administration was indifferent.\n\nBut, again, the order\u2019s text instructs the bureaucracy to \u201cprioritize\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 future refu\u00adgee claims from \u201cminority\u201d religions, implying Middle Eastern Christians without saying so expressly. That leaves the door open to Yazidis, Bahais and even Shiite Muslims from majority-Sunni countries.\n\nNo doubt even that reading entangles the executive branch in the questionable business of defining \u201cmajority\u201d and \u201cminority\u201d religious denominations, and choosing among them. However, courts might well worry that once they start supervising those decisions, they\u2019ll never be able to stop.\n\nLike other wide congressional grants of authority to the executive branch \u2014 the power to levy \u201cemergency\u201d tariffs comes to mind \u2014 the vast discretion over immigration Trump has inherited was a product of a different time.\n\nLawmakers during the post-World War II era assumed presidents of both parties agreed on certain broad lessons of prewar history, such as the need to remain widely engaged through trade and collective security, and the importance of humanitarian values \u2014 \u201csoft power\u201d \u2014 in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThey did not anticipate today\u2019s breakdown in national consensus, much less that heirs to the America Firsters who had failed to attain national power before World War II could ever attain it afterward.\n\nThe judicial protection that plaintiffs seek from Trump\u2019s executive order may be unprecedented; if so, that\u2019s partly because the violations they allege were once unimaginable.\n\nRead more from Charles Lane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
