It warned that upholding Watson's ruling would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe revised order bans new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Hawaii says the policy discriminates against Muslims and hurts the state's economy.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-04-07", "type": "article"}
