The Justice Department said it is reviewing the decision and considering its options. It was the first day on the job for new Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe lower court action so far is temporary and hasn't resolved broader questions about the legality of Trump's order. While the ban is on hold, refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim nations identified in the president's Jan. 27 executive order can continue traveling to the U.S.\n\nThe appellate judges noted compelling public interests on both sides.\n\n\"On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.\"\n\nThe administration could appeal the ruling to a larger 9th Circuit panel or bypass that step and go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. That could put the decision over whether to keep the temporary restraining order suspending the ban in the hands of a divided court that has a vacancy. Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, cannot be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban, which would expire in 90 days unless it is changed.\n\nThe ban also faces dozens of other lawsuits, some filed by would-be refugees directly affected by it.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said two footnotes near the end of the opinion struck him as most significant because they challenged the government's assertion that national security was at stake. Without evidence of the threat migrants would pose to security, the court couldn't balance that assertion against harm they would suffer if not allowed to enter the country.\n\n\"It's not enough for the president to simply proclaim that the executive order is necessary to protect national security,\" Vladeck said, paraphrasing the ruling. \"He needs to give us at least some basis for agreeing with him.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit judges rejected the administration's argument that courts did not have the authority to review the president's immigration and national security decisions. They said the administration failed to show that the order met constitutional requirements to provide notice or a hearing before restricting travel. And they said the administration presented no evidence that any foreigner from the seven countries was responsible for a terrorist attack in the U.S.\n\n\"Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years,\" the panel wrote.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The ban temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump's tweet, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said, \"We have seen him in court twice and we're two for two, that's number one. And in my view, the future of the constitution is at stake.\"\n\nJustice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit after Robart's ruling, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\n\nThe states said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.\n\nThe appeals court sided with the administration on just one issue. The states had argued that 9th Circuit precedent prohibits review of temporary restraining orders. The panel said that the intense public interest and uncertainty over how long the court case might take made it appropriate for the court to consider the federal government's appeal.\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said the ruling was thoughtful and supported by a great deal of legal precedent. More important, though, it was unanimous even though the panel included judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\n\"It's a very important message that judges are not just politicians in robes and not just political hacks,\" Levinson said.\n\nAfter the ban was put on hold, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 with valid visas could travel to the U.S.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Gene Johnson and Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
