From the outset, it was a pitched battle before a notoriously liberal Circuit. That said, the Justice Department acquitted itself well \u2013 and may have won an upset. If not the Super Bowl, there were surprises.\n\nKick off was simple. Justice briefed a three-judge panel on the need for a temporary pause in migration from seven countries identified by Congress and the prior Administration as terrorist risks. They laid out the President\u2019s constitutional authority, equities against the temporary restraining order, and law that supported a swift stay.\n\nSeconds in, the Carter appointee Judge William Canby interrupted proceedings, demanding \u201cevidence of the need for this executive order.\u201d Findings were patiently offered, including the need to review refugee screening and visa process, as well as recent events.\n\nBefore Counsel for the United States could continue, Canby threw a second block: \u201cCan you point to any evidence connecting these countries to terror?\u201d Justice methodically noted that such evidence has existed for years. Moreover, it was acknowledged by Congress and the prior Administration, which is why the seven countries faced visa restrictions. They present a \u201csignificant risk,\u201d making them \u201ccountries of concern.\u201d\n\nCanby then assumed the role of a one-man National Security Council. \u201cIsn\u2019t the concept of risk too abstract? Is there any reason to believe there is a real risk? What changes to support significant risk?\u201d Justice kept to the playbook, kept the drive going. \u201cThe President determined there is a real risk, \u201ccame into office to protect the national security of the country,\u201d and believes \u201cvisa screening procedures are crucial.\u201d The Executive Order is grounded and limited.\n\nThe next hit was for terrorism examples. Where had there been terrorist events in the United States traced to these countries? Of course, the answer was that the Executive Order aims to prevent such incidents. Justice began, \u201cpeople from Somalia have been connected to Al-Shabaab, a terrorist \u2013\u201c\n\nObama\u2019s nominee, Judge Michelle Friedland, interrupted and flew at Justice: \u201cYou appealed before you developed the record?\u201d No, said Justice, we \u201csought immediate relief because a lower court tried to override a presidential decision on level of tolerable national security risk\u201d and \u201cthe President is the official charged with making that judgement.\u201d\n\nA tactical switch. \u201cIs the decision reviewable?\u201d pressed Friedland. Yes, was Justice\u2019s answer, but deciding what is \u201cdetrimental\u201d to \u201cfundamental sovereignty\u201d is a president\u2019s chore. Judicial review is limited to whether the presidential determination of risk is \u201cbona fides\u201d and \u201clegitimate.\u201d\n\nFriedlander quickly slid into \u201cbad faith.\u201d Referring to the President, she asked: \u201cAre there not allegations of bad faith? Don\u2019t we need to look at that?\u201d Justice got firm. \u201cReview needs to be confined to the four corners of the document,\u201d and \u201cstanding.\u201d\n\nJudge Canby now pressed his luck. He now argued that a third party \u2013 a State \u2013 might bring an action for anyone, as they might for clean air. The analogy flopped. The United States observed, in the immigration context, a third party cannot challenge visa denials. That is case law. Canby cited a case where a wife sued for a husband. The United States spun out of the tackle, noting both had constitutional rights.\n\nNow the field got muddy. These Democrat-appointed judges wanted to reach the merits, but were stiff armed. They wanted to argue the Executive Order offended religious freedom, based on favoring one faith over another and violating the \u201cno establishment\u201d clause, or through \u201cequal protection.\u201d They got little traction.\n\nFinally, Friedland asked: \u201cCould the President simply say he would not let Muslims in?\u201d Justice did not fall for the juke. They ran a tight pattern. \u201cThat is not what the Executive Order does.\u201d Later they were blunt, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nNearing halftime, \u201cstanding\u201d got discussed, the United States explaining that only citizens have standing in an immigration case. If States could sue on behalf of anyone at any time, the concept of standing would have no meaning. The restraining order was overbroad, president within his rights, stay required. The Democrat-appointed judges had still made yardage.\n\nNext came the States, Washington and Minnesota. They took the field with enthusiasm, first arguing procedure then the constitution. Some quips were simple, others Hail Mary passes \u2013 all tinged with recrimination toward the President.\n\nArguing that freedom of religion affected everyone, entitling States to standing, they claimed \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to religious liberty. When they fumbled, they were up fast. But now came another player.\n\nAt last, George W. Bush\u2019s nominee Judge Richard Clifton stepped up. He began throwing pinpoint passes. Where was violation of an American\u2019s religious liberty? Where in the \u201cfour corners of the document?\u201d Suddenly, the rejoinder was more \u201cbad faith.\u201d\n\nWhere \u201cbad faith?\u201d The States said, although narrow implementation now preserved rights for visa holders and permanent residents, the order was prejudicial. The text left vulnerable \u201chalf a million in the United States.\u201d Judge Clifton was having none of that. He began a new drive.\n\nWhere was nefarious intent, \u201cdiscriminatory animus?\u201d Where was the constitutional violation, absent text or intent to support the claim? On very weak footing, how did the States claim \u201clikelihood of success\u201d on the merits? Without that likelihood, how could a temporary restraining order stand? The States retreated to remarks about implementation, claims of anti-Muslim.\n\nClifton had them. \u201cA bit of quick pencil math shows that the order only covers 15 percent of worldwide Muslims, how can that produce religious discrimination on either \u2018no establishment\u2019 or \u2018equal protection\u2019 grounds? How can you infer religious animus from that, if the vast majority around the world are not affected?\u201d Bingo! Touchdown!\n\nWhen the States cited campaign headlines, Clifton noted the lower court held those not relevant. Clifton turned to hard facts. Wasn\u2019t terrorism identified with these seven countries? Weren\u2019t they \u201ccountries of concern\u201d based on \u201csignificant risk\u201d \u2013 as assessed by the prior administration? Was the prior administration \u201creligiously motivated\u201d in making that determination? Another surprise touchdown!\n\nIf the underlying restraining order and arguments against the stay required \u201clikelihood of success\u201d on \u201creligious animus,\u201d and there was none, why not grant the stay? The issue was not about the stay \u2013 but about the underlying temporary order. He said the States \u201cmisunderstood the standard.\u201d More points, maybe conversions.\n\nFriedland jumped in. They were fumbling. \u201cWeren\u2019t you going to supplement the record with added exhibits\u201d on religious animus? Oh yes, yes, that\u2019s right. The States said they just had not had enough time to prepare. Wrong argument.\n\nClifton threw for final points. \u201cDon\u2019t tell us that you did not have the time to prove likelihood of success \u2013 that allegation will not cut it at this stage.\u201d The air was thick with possible reversal, now. Friedland jumped again. \u201cYou want a reasoned opinion, right? One that will address your concerns, right?\u201d Yes, yes.\n\nMaybe the winning points \u2013 came last. From Clifton. Arguments of national origin, as a basis for discrimination, flew in the face of past lawful orders. Cuba for example? This is the prerogative of a president, right? Isn\u2019t North Korea different from France? Touche!\n\nSo, could the unlikely happen? Could a Ninth Circuit panel, split two-to-one activist judges, actually issue a stay \u2013 permitting the President\u2019s Order to stand, at least for now? Might Clifton\u2019s questions convert someone, one of the two? Not likely, but stranger things have happened. This has been an unlikely season start to finish, November through last Sunday. Maybe the unlikely is now likely \u2013 or maybe we will meet at the U.S. Supreme Court. We shall all know soon.\n\nRobert Charles is a former assistant secretary of state for President George W.
