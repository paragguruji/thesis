If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" He followed with another tweet saying he had instructed the Homeland Security Department to check people coming into the country but that \"the courts are making the job very difficult!\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Sunday in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the federal judge who halted Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban \u201cmade the wrong decision\u201d and vowed to use \u201call legal means at our disposal\u201d to protect Americans.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset of his campaign and administration, the president of the United States has made it clear to put the safety of the American people first,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe are going to win this argument.\u201d\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and the United States\u2019 Syrian refugee program. The order follows his steadfast argument that radical Islamic terrorism poses a major threat to Americans\u2019 safety.\n\nThe order immediately caused confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the U.S., prompted nationwide airport protests and led to multiple court challenges.\n\nThe federal government has until later today to respond to the state's briefs.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["travel", "lifting", "ban", "immigration", "judge", "chaos", "court", "order", "president", "trumps", "federal", "filed", "states", "halt", "unleash", "say"], "summary": "Lawyers for Minnesota and Washington state told a federal appellate court Monday that it would \u201cunleash chaos\u201d if it lifted an order temporarily halting President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslims countries from entering the U.S.\nCircuit Court of Appeals that Trump\u2019s travel ban harmed residents, businesses and universities and stated that the ban was unconstitutional.\nA federal judge in Seattle imposed a temporary restraining order on Trump\u2019s ban, in response to a case filed last week by Washington and Minnesota challenging Trump\u2019s constitutional authority to unilaterally impose such a sweeping ban.\nOn Saturday night, a federal appeals court denied a Trump administration request to lift the restraining order and allow the immigration ban to continue.\nThat ruling prompted an ongoing Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart as a \"so-called judge\" and his decision \"ridiculous.\""}
