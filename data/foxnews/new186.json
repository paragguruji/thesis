The report, aimed at reforming the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, or USRAP, calls for stricter limits and restrictions on refugees.\n\n\u201cThere is no universal right to migrate, resettlement is not the solution to mass displacement, and U.S. policymakers have a responsibility to ensure that the United States takes in only as many refugees as it can safely vet and assimilate,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe United States operates the program not because it is obligated to resettle refugees, but because the U.S. is a humane country and USRAP serves its national interests.\u201d\n\nThe report, written by policy analyst David Inserra, could lend weight to the Trump administration's effort to curtail the number of refugees who come to the U.S. every year. But perhaps most worrisome, the report warns that no amount of refugee vetting can account for the \"1.5 generation\" -- those who come to the U.S. with peaceful intentions and then become radicalized while living in America.\n\nISIS GUNNED DOWN PREGNANT WOMEN, BABIES, FORMER NAVY SEAL RECALLS\n\n\u201cGiven the threat that we found in the 1.5 generation, more needs to be done in the U.S. assimilation process,\u201d said John Cooper, spokesman for the Heritage Foundation. \u201cWe can\u2019t vet an 8-year-old to see if he will become a terrorist when he turns 18 or 28. Instead, we as a country need to rethink the way we assimilate refugees, and immigrants as a whole for that matter.\n\n\u201cIn the past few decades, the United States has drifted from its strong assimilation ethos, and the terrorism in Europe paints a disturbing picture of where non-assimilation leads,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken measures to both limit and more tightly screen refugees. Earlier this year, the administration reduced the number of refugees that it would accept this fiscal year from the Obama administration\u2019s intended 110,000 to 50,000 \u2013 and that cap has almost been reached.\n\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\n\n\u201cA review is especially critical following the Obama administration\u2019s rapid, and largely unprecedented, expansion of the program in the final year of his administration,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cAny administration has a responsibility to ensure all existing refugee and immigration programs, including the USRAP, best serve U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nA U.S. State Department official told Fox News the administration will soon provide guidance regarding those already scheduled for travel before last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision lifting an injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from six mostly Muslim countries plagued by terror.\n\nEUROPEANS VOW MORE HELP TO STEM LIBYA-ITALY MIGRANT FLOW\n\nBut the report leaves little doubt that the perpetrators of future terror attacks are already here, including some who may not yet be radicalized. It recommends a long-term focus be placed on migrants \u201cembracing an American creed, learning English and gaining an education\u201d which will in turn help them to develop and sustain \u201can American identity and sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nThe report also supported the widely reported claim that refugees coming to the U.S undergo more vetting than any other immigrants coming to the country under other types of programs and visa categories. The vetting process for refugees typically takes 18 to 24 months from the time of the initial referral by the U.N. refugee agency, but \u201cin the waning months of the Obama administration the U.S. reduced the time to as little as three months for Syrians by surging resources to the region.\u201d\n\nIt also mandated that a \u201cfoolproof vetting system\u201d is impossible, with obvious limitations, such as lack of identification or forged documents especially when fleeing war.\n\n\u201cTo be as cost-effective as possible \u2013 which saves the most lives \u2013 the U.S. should focus the majority of its refugee efforts on helping front-line states care for the refugees they shelter,\u201d the report states.\n\nSpecifically, the report suggests that the U.S. can do more to urge Middle Eastern countries \u2013 most notably the oil-wealthy Gulf States \u2013 to resettle Syrian and Iraqi refugees.\n\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\n\n\u201cMany Syrian and Iraqi refugees share similar cultural and religious values with the people of the Gulf States, which have the financial capacity for resettlement,\u201d the report found. \u201cSaudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have donated hundreds of millions of dollars each for relief efforts, but the U.S. should urge the Gulf States to increase their aid for their Arab Muslim neighbors by resettling Syrians with all the rights and protections due to refugees.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, the Gulf States are not signatories to the U.N. Refugee Protocol and thus do not offer refugee status. They will admit some primarily as migrant workers or to reunify families.\n\nFraud is also a cause for concern, according to the report. It cites as an example the Dadaab refugee camp in northern Kenya, which was exposed several years ago for developing an entire industry centered on \u201ccoaching applicants\u201d and selling resettlement slots for as much as $10,000.\n\nThe report goes on to outline ways in which the U.S. could minimize fiscal costs and improve economic outcomes by establishing private resettlement programs on a trial basis rather than relying solely on government. But above all, the report emphasizes the need to ensure the program first and foremost puts America first.\n\nIt argues that refugee resettlement can indeed advance national interests by enabling the U.S. to \u201cassert American leadership in foreign crisis,\u201d providing \u201cthe U.S. with a way to respond positively to intractable crisis\u201d and assisting allies and partners in crisis. But reviews by the Trump team to the program to achieve this objective are crucial.\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.
