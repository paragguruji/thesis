A decision could come at any time.\n\n\"We're in an area where, let's just say, they are interpreting things differently from probably 100 pecent of people in this room,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump read out parts of the federal law outlining presidential powers on the subject, saying it was written clearly and \"beautifully.\u201d\n\nThe part of the U.S. Code he read specifies that when the president \"finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation ... suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\n\n\u201cA bad high school student would understand this,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said he listened to the judges Tuesday and, while vowing not to comment specifically on the hearing, said: \"I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful, it was disgraceful.\"\n\nSupporters of Trump's order say it will help keep America safe from terrorists looking to infiltrate the United States from terror hotspots that often have inadequate vetting procedures. Opponents have argued it is unconstitutional and discriminatory \u2013 claiming that it is a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that Trump campaign statements about a Muslim ban showed discriminatory intent.\n\n\"There are statements that we've quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims, given that we haven't even had any discovery yet to find out what else might have been said in private,\" Purcell said.\n\nTrump has waded into the legal battle before, largely on Twitter. He recently called the judge who halted the order, James Robart, a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and earlier Wednesday warned on Twitter that, \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017\n\nAt the meeting with police chiefs, he indicated he would be ready to criticize the appeals court if it ruled against his administration.\n\n\"I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won\u2019t call it biased and we haven\u2019t had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political,\" he said. \u201cIt would be so great for our justice system if they were able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right and that\u2019s to do with the security of our nation, which is so important.\u201d\n\nHe warned that until the issue was resolved, the nation's security would be at risk.\n\n\"I think it's sad, I think it's a sad day,\" he said. \"I think our security is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as...we get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.
