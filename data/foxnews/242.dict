One soldier says he has bought a plane ticket for his Afghan translator in case that country is added to the list of banned nations.\n\nMany veterans say they feel betrayed by the executive order that President Donald Trump signed Friday.\n\nThey say the fight feels personal since they gave their word to people who risked their lives to aid American troops that the United States would protect them and their families.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said the move is aimed at protecting the nation against extremists looking to attack Americans and American interests.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
