Lawyer Gadeir (geh-DEER') Abbas said a section of the order affecting how waivers are granted for visa applicants remains in force.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler said the remaining provisions of the travel ban have no practical effect on how the government issues visas.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "type": "article"}
