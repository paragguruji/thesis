They also said a third incident, in a southern part of the city named Vauxhall and thought to be connected to the other attacks, has been ruled out as a terror strike.\n\nTrump later tweeted: \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nTrump's executive order to impose a temporary travel on six mostly Muslim nations, training grounds for radical Islamic terror groups, is being held up in federal courts and appears headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nHis most recent tweet was: \"Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said the incidents are being treated as potential terror attacks.\n\nThe White House said Trump spoke with May and personally offered his condolences for \"the brutal terror attacks.\"\n\nTrump also praised the \"heroic response of police and other first- responders,\" according to the White House.\n\nThe incidents come 12 days after a suicide bomber with apparent ties to terror groups killed 22 people and injured scores of others outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England.\n\nWithin minutes of the first incident, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the president had been apprised.\n\nThe State Department said the United States \"condemns the cowardly attacks targeting innocent civilians,\" which the agency understands are being treated by local authorities as terror incidents.\n\nAn agency spokeswoman also said the U.S. \"stands ready to provide any assistance\" and expressed support for the victims and their families.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a statement in which an official said the agency is \"closely monitoring the ongoing situation.\"\n\nThe agency also said it so far has no information to indicate a \"specific, credible terror threat in the United States.\"\n\nHomeland Secretary John Kelly told Fox News said such a attack is \"right around the corner\" in the United States and that DHS and other domestic law enforcement agencies are working tirelessly to prevent another one here.\n\nHe repeated that the biggest threats remain explosives on airplanes and people in the U.S. being \"radicalized\" and committing attacks on American soil.\n\n\"I do toss and turn all night,\" Kelly also said.\n\nDHS also urged Americans in the area to \"heed direction from local authorities and maintain security awareness.\"\n\nIn addition, the agency is encouraging American citizens who need assistance to contact the U.S. Embassy in London and follow State Department guidance.\n\nFox News' Shannon Bream, Jennifer Bowman, John Roberts and Joseph Weber contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-03", "type": "article"}
