That's one fewer than the original ban after Iraq was removed from the list. The order also suspends the entire U.S. refugee program.\n\nBut the measure applies only to refugees who are not already on their way to the United States and people seeking new visas. It also removes language about religious minorities that critics say was written to help Christians.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
