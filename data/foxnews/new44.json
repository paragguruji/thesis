It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nHomeland Security said the order affects a small amount of people traveling internationally.\n\nThe DHS said the order was the \u201cfirst step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban sparked protests around the country at several international airports. Demonstrators ranged from a few dozen people to thousands.\n\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. However, an official with the DHS said Saturday night that no green-card holders from the seven countries cited in Trump's order had been prevented from entering the U.S.\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nTrump's order also drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program.\n\nThe DHS said in the statement that they \u201cwill faithfully execute the immigration laws, and we will treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\u201d They also added that they plan to ensure the safety of the American people by making sure those entering the U.S. pose no threat.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "ban", "security", "statement", "refugee", "trumps", "dhs", "continue", "order", "enforce", "safety"], "summary": "A federal judge issued an emergency order Saturday night temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban, saying travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated.\nStephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said, \"Nothing in the Brooklyn judge's order in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\"\nThe DHS said the order was the \u201cfirst step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\u201dTrump\u2019s travel ban sparked protests around the country at several international airports.\nUnder Trump's order, it had appeared that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days even though they held permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas.\nTrump's order also drew support from some Republican lawmakers who have urged more security measures for the refugee vetting program."}
