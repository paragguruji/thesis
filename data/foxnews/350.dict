The 32-page ruling concludes that President Donald Trump is likely within his rights to temporarily ban immigration from six Muslim-majority countries and suspend the U.S. refugee program.\n\nA lawyer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the suit, said his client will appeal.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "type": "article"}
