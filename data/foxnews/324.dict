All times local.\n\n9 a.m.\n\nHawaii has filed an amended federal lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's revised travel ban.\n\nThe state filed the suit Tuesday night with updates on its existing challenge to Trump's previous order. It says the order will harm the Muslim population of Hawaii.\n\nThe new order, announced Monday, bars new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily shuts down America's refugee program, affecting would-be visitors and immigrants from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.\n\nHawaii's lawsuit says it is suing to protect its residents, businesses and schools, as well as its \"sovereignty against illegal actions of President Donald J. Trump and the federal government.\"\n\nHawaii's lawsuit had been on hold while a nationwide injunction on the initial ban remained in place.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-08", "type": "article"}
