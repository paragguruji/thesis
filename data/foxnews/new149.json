I was wrong. I've consulted with lawyers. I'm now addressing it simply to security needs.' Has he ever said anything approaching that?\" Hawkins asked.\n\n\u201cYes, Judge Hawkins, he has said several things approaching that,\" Wall replied. \"I think that\u2019s detailed in various amicus briefs.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyer Neal Katyal attacked that response. \"I thought his answer was surprising because he couldn\u2019t actually point to any disavowal. He just cited en masse amicus briefs because the truth is there is no such statement,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Richard Paez called the president's pre-inaugurations comments \"profound\" though necessary to view through the perspective of heated campaign rhetoric.\n\nKatyal conceded the point about campaign hyperbole, and then drew attention to comments Trump made since taking office.\n\nThe president\u2019s order, revised from its original text, would suspend travel and immigration from six mostly Muslim countries.\n\nIn March, a federal judge in Hawaii enjoined the order from taking effect, not based on the language of the directive, but rather the \u201creligious animus\u201d of comments Trump and his advocates made about the policy.\n\nWall, however, argues the president\u2019s policy is not a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d but rather Trump\u2019s good faith effort to protect rights while securing the homeland from foreign terrorists.\n\nThe order would temporarily halt refugees from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country. It also freezes refugee admissions so intelligence and security officials can review existing admission procedures.\n\nMonday\u2019s hearing marked the second time the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has heard a government appeal on the matter. Earlier this year, a different panel of judges affirmed a lower court injunction against the president\u2019s initial travel ban order, which he revoked in issuing his second version.\n\nSeveral weeks ago Trump blasted the 9th Circuit, saying his opponents are \u201cjudge shopping\u201d in the court that covers the western United States.\n\nThe three judges hearing Monday\u2019s case were randomly chosen from the circuit\u2019s members--all three were appointed by former President Bill Clinton. While some other 9th Circuit judges have said the president\u2019s order is on sound legal ground, they were not impaneled on either case.\n\nLast week in Richmond, Virginia, another federal appellate court heard similar arguments over the president\u2019s order. Either case \u2013 or both \u2013 could end up before the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Lee Ross"], "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["skeptical", "travel", "judges", "trump", "ban", "circuit", "security", "judge", "9th", "court", "faces", "order", "muslim", "hearing", "presidents", "panel"], "summary": "\"How is a court to know if [the executive order] is a Muslim ban in the guise of national security justification?\"\nThe president\u2019s order, revised from its original text, would suspend travel and immigration from six mostly Muslim countries.\nEarlier this year, a different panel of judges affirmed a lower court injunction against the president\u2019s initial travel ban order, which he revoked in issuing his second version.\nWhile some other 9th Circuit judges have said the president\u2019s order is on sound legal ground, they were not impaneled on either case.\nLast week in Richmond, Virginia, another federal appellate court heard similar arguments over the president\u2019s order."}
