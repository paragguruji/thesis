American Security is # 1! We stand by you.#BoyCottStarbucks #AmericaFirst \u2014 Keep'n It Real!

Supporters also point to the fact that Starbucks also has the Starbucks Veterans & Military Spouses program to create job opportunities specifically for veterans.\n\nY'all really trying to #BoycottStarbucks for trying to help out people in need? Didn't y'all want Starbucks to practice Christian values? \u2014 Samuel Davis \ud83d\udd46 (@SamDavis1997) January 30, 2017\n\nStarbucks hires thousands of vets, pays the tuition for spouse and children of vets to attend college. #DrinkStarbucksToFightBigotry \u2014 Lenabenas (@lenabenas21) January 31, 2017\n\nIn the wake of Schultz\u2019s announcement, Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent have also expressed similar disappointment in the president\u2019s executive order, though neither has announced any specific plans to hire refugees in direct response.\n\n\u201cAmerica has always been a symbol of hope, tolerance and diversity \u2014 and these are values we must work very hard to uphold,\u201d Ulukaya reportedly wrote to Chobani employees in an inter-office memo.\n\nMeanwhile, Muhtar released a statement to Bloomberg in which he stated, \u201cCoca-Cola Co. is resolute in its commitment to diversity, fairness and inclusion, and we do not support this travel ban or any policy that is contrary to our core values and beliefs.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time Starbucks has drawn the ire of Trump supporters. Last year, fans of the then-president elect took to Starbucks, asking baristas to write \u201cTrump\u201d on their cups in a movement known as #TrumpCup. Some customers claimed to have been refused a #TrumpCup and accused the chain of suppressing their right to political expression.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
