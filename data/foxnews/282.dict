In a hearing Tuesday, judges on the appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims.\n\nTrump said he was watching the proceedings on television. He noted that there had not been a decision yet, but said that \"courts seem to be so political.\" He added that it \"would be so great for our justice system if they could just read a statement and do what's right. And that has to do with the security of our nation which is so important.\"\n\nTrump also repeated his promises to reduce violence in Chicago, saying that \"no one in America should be punished\" because of their birthplace. He pledged to provide resources to police departments and promised \"zero tolerance\" for violence against law enforcement.\n\nTrump also promised to work on combating drug abuse and said there should be resources to deal with a \"mental health crisis.\"\n\nHundreds of members of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and Major County Sheriff's Association were in the standing room crowd, some in uniform but the majority in plain clothes.\n\nThey snapped photos with their phones as the president spoke, but clapped sparingly when he asked whether they were in agreement with his views on the immigration ban. His comments about combatting drug abuse and the targeting of police officers drew a more unanimous response from the crowd.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
