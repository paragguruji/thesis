the appeal of President Donald Trump's revised travel ban (all times local):\n\n1:05 p.m.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer expressed confidence that President Trump's travel ban order will be upheld by an appeals court.\n\nSpicer said Monday the executive order is fully lawful.\n\nHe did not address why Trump hasn't disavowed his calls during the campaign for a ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nThe comments came after a three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle heard arguments Monday in a lawsuit filed by Hawaii over the ban.\n\nThe judges are being asked to overturn an order blocking Trump's directive.\n\n___\n\n10:52 a.m.\n\nArguments have wrapped up in a federal appeals court in Seattle over President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nThe

statements calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nThey asked a lawyer for the state of Hawaii challenging the ban about whether the national security rationale spelled out in the president's executive order neutralized any claim that the travel ban was motivated by discrimination.\n\nThe judges gave no indication of when they might rule.\n\n___\n\n10:26 a.m.\n\nA federal appeals court judge is questioning a lawyer for Hawaii about past cases in which he argued that the president has broad authority over immigration matters.\n\nJudge Michael Hawkins pointed to arguments that former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal made in previous cases.\n\nKatyal said he stands by those arguments, but that doesn't mean the president's authority is unbounded.\n\nThe judges in Seattle are hearing arguments over Hawaii's lawsuit challenging the travel ban, which would suspend the nation's refugee program and temporarily bar new visas for citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n___\n\n10:12 a.m.\n\nAn attorney for the state of Hawaii says President Donald Trump has never repudiated his campaigns statements calling for a ban on Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nDuring arguments in Seattle, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Paez questioned attorney Neal Katyal about Trump's statements, calling them \"profound.\"\n\nBut the

legitimate measures.\n\n___\n\n10:06 a.m.\n\nA Trump administration lawyer says the president's travel ban is nothing like the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II.\n\nJudge Richard Paez questioned Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall on whether the case wasn't like one \u2014 now largely reviled \u2014 in which the Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of Japanese Americans.\n\nWall responded that Trump's order is nothing like that, and if it were, he wouldn't be defending it before the court.\n\nThe judges in Seattle are hearing arguments over Hawaii's lawsuit

lawyer for President Donald Trump says he has clarified campaign rhetoric in which he called for a ban on Muslims.\n\nActing Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall told a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.

terrorist groups and the countries that sponsor or shelter them.\"\n\nThe judges in Seattle are hearing arguments over Hawaii's lawsuit challenging the travel ban, which would suspend the nation's refugee program and temporarily bar new visas for citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n___\n\n9:49 a.m.\n\nA federal appeals court is peppering a lawyer for President Donald Trump about whether his travel ban discriminates against Muslims.\n\nActing Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall says the executive order halting travel from six majority Muslim nations doesn't say anything about religion, and neither the state of Hawaii nor an imam from that state who wants his mother-in-law to visit has standing to sue.\n\nJudge Richard Paez asked Wall how Trump's order can be squared with a federal law banning discrimination based on nationality in immigration.\n\nArguments are underway in Seattle over whether to reinstate the travel ban.\n\nThe hearings are being broadcast live on C-SPAN and other cable news stations.\n\n___\n\n9:38 a.m.\n\nArguments are underway in Seattle over whether to reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nActing Solicitor General Jeffrey
