April's number was only a bit higher.\n\nAn executive order signed by Trump in January decreased the refugee limit from 110,000 to 50,000 this fiscal year, but the cap was not blocked in court until mid-March.\n\nThat caused the State Department to tightly rein in monthly arrivals when the cap was in effect.\n\nMany approved refugees had their travel documents expire during that time, forcing them to restart the whole process and leaving them in limbo.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-09", "type": "article"}
