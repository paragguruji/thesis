He added that order in the White House might not be restored until Priebus leaves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff \u2014 and Donald trusted him \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head,\u201d Ruddy told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should\u2019ve been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity.\u201d\n\nRuddy tweeted that he and Trump talked over drinks at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort late Friday, but Ruddy insisted he was only speaking for himself, and not Trump.\n\nRuddy spoke with The Post shortly after he told CNN he thought there was \u201ca lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff.\u201d\n\nRuddy attempted to walk some of the comments he made on network, saying in a tweet that Priebus had briefed him on some of the \"impressive\" new White House plans. He also tweeted that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, was doing a terrific job.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Ruddy had told Priebus that he would stand by his criticisms, but would \u201cmeet up and have dinner in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe White House defended the chief of staff after Ruddy\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe president has made unbelievable progress in just his first 21 days, bringing back jobs, saving taxpayers money and securing the nation. Reince has successfully led the team that has implemented President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d White House deputy communications director Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.\n\nAnother senior White House official told the paper whether Ruddy\u2019s comments were relevant, saying \u201cThis sounds like somebody with an ax to grind who has no real access to the president.\u201d\n\nThough Ruddy had criticism for Priebus, he sang the praises of White House press secretary Sean Spicer and other administration officials who were scrutinized about the travel ban.\n\nClick for more from The Washington Post.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "type": "article"}
