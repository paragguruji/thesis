The administration appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which largely upheld Watson's injunction.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court said the president's ban on visitors from the six countries can be enforced pending arguments scheduled for October, as long as those visitors lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\" Likewise, the justices said, refugees can travel to the U.S. if they demonstrate those connections.\n\nThe high court's majority laid out the \"bona fide\" relationships it had in mind. For individuals, a close family relationship is required: A spouse or a mother-in-law would be permitted. So would a worker who accepted a job from an American company, a student enrolled at a U.S. university or a lecturer invited to address a U.S. audience.\n\nA relationship created for purposes of avoiding the travel ban would not bebona fide, the justices said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sudhin Thanawala in San Francisco and Caleb Jones in Honolulu contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Audrey Mcavoy"], "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["leaves", "fide", "travel", "relationship", "hawaii", "ban", "place", "supreme", "bona", "judge", "rules", "court", "trumps", "watson", "administration"], "summary": "A federal judge in Hawaii on Thursday left Trump administration rules in place for a travel ban on citizens from six majority-Muslim countries.\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson denied an emergency motion filed by Hawaii asking him to clarify what the U.S. Supreme Court meant by a \"bona fide\" relationship in its ruling last month.\nWatson says the relationship question would be better posed to the Supreme Court, not him.\nThe high court's majority laid out the \"bona fide\" relationships it had in mind.\nA relationship created for purposes of avoiding the travel ban would not bebona fide, the justices said."}
