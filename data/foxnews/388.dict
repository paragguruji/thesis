September 11, 2001.\u201d\n\nSome find the billboard hateful, WSOC-TV reported on Friday.\n\n\"I believe in the Christian way and that's to embrace everybody,\u201d a man named Oliver Reitzell told the station. \u201cKind of the hate message behind it. I'm not for that.\"\n\nAn associate pastor Paul Cummings said the billboard contradicts teachings from the Bible.\n\n\"My opinion is that I think these people need the saving gospel of Jesus more than I need to be protected,\u201d Cummings told the station. \u201cI'm perfectly willing for people who are hostile to us, to be in our country, because that's what loving your enemy is all about.\"\n\nA group called the North Carolina Pastors Network paid for the billboard and has refused to remove it.\n\n\"This has nothing whatsoever to do with hatred or hostility toward anyone that comes from a background,\" Dave Kistler, the group\u2019s president, told WCNC-TV. \"I have dear friends that are Muslim.\"\n\nThe station points out that the 19 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Lebanon. Those countries are not part of the president's travel ban.\n\nThe U.S. appeals court in Virginia ruled Thursday that the Trump revised ban violated constitutional rights.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-26", "type": "article"}
