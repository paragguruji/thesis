Sometimes months would go by with no news, but he thought the stress was worth it.\n\nAssured their refugee life was coming to an end, he quit his job working with kids in Zaatari refugee camp, sold his furniture for 150 dinars ($212), bought five suitcases and packed them. His uncle in Rockford, Illinois, rented him an apartment and furnished it in anticipation.\n\nGradually good news for other families came \u2014 an Iraqi family gone, followed by a Syrian. His was one of the last still awaiting permission to go when news of the White House executive order banning travel from six Muslim nations sapped their hope.\n\nTwo months later, Samah gave birth to the couple's second son, two months premature \u2014 a tragedy al-Haji Ali still blames on Trump. The family waited in the hospital for a month as the baby struggled to survive in an incubator with partially formed lungs and an umbilical hernia.\n\nThey named him Laith, after Al-Haj Ali's brother, who was killed by the Syrian regime. The baby's brother, Khaled, had been named after their grandfather, who died in a regime prison.\n\nThe family says they've received no clarification of their status from the coordinating refugee agencies and feel stuck in limbo. Their five suitcases remain in storage.\n\nAs he waits in northern Jordan, mere miles from his hometown in war-ravaged Deraa in southern Syria, jobless in a mostly empty house, Al-Haj Ali is desperate to escape the region.\n\nHe dreams of a better life, proper medical treatment for his infant son, and of pursuing a doctorate in economics. But not in America.\n\n\"Maybe there will be a new law: Refugees aren't allowed to study in universities, refugees aren't allowed in certain hospitals, not allowed to go into New York or some other state,\" he said, sitting in the family's sparse apartment.\n\n\"The future there is not secure.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
