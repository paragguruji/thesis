The group says the new version of the travel ban discriminates against Muslims and raises the same legal issues as the original.\n\nRobart also is overseeing the legal challenge brought by Washington state. He also issued the order halting nationwide implementation of the first ban. Among the plaintiffs in the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project case is a legal permanent resident who has been trying to bring her 16-year-old son from war-torn Syria.\n\nThe Trump administration says it believes its revised order is legal.
