Jafri advises clients on how to navigate the U.S.\u2019s changes in immigration policies.\n\n\u201cIt is still unclear if a national from one of the banned countries will get a visa to visit a family member, participate in a conference, visit schools or come for a job interview,\u201d Jafri said. \u201cWill these be considered bona fide reasons to visit the U.S.? My sense is \u2018no\u2019 and the implication is that U.S. businesses, universities and families will be negatively impacted.\u201d\n\nAll nine justices agreed in the 13-page decision to take up the case in the fall, setting up a showdown over the legality of the order.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito Jr. and Thomas wrote a three-page opinion saying they would have allowed Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect fully, without regard to a foreign national\u2019s connection to the United States. Their dissent could foreshadow a tough road ahead for opponents of the travel ban.\n\nThe justices agreed to hear oral arguments on the merits of the executive order \u2013 whether the ban is lawful or exceeds the president\u2019s powers - during the Court's next term, which begins in October.\n\nThough Monday\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t the final word on the travel ban, Trump touted it as \u201ca clear victory for our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cI want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.\u201d\n\nTrump has been incensed since his original executive order, signed on Jan. 27, was partially blocked by a federal court.\n\n\"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions can come into U.S.?\" Trump tweeted on Feb. 4.\n\nHe added on Feb. 11: \"Our legal system is broken!\"\n\nIn early March, Trump issued a revised executive order -- which also had key provisions blocked by federal courts.\n\nTrump has been spoiling for the Supreme Court to take up the case and eager to get it out of the hands of what he sees as more liberal appellate judges.\n\nFour days after signing the original ban, Trump nominated Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated when Antonin Scalia died.\n\nGorsuch, who has since been confirmed, is largely seen as a conservative, originalist justice in the Scalia mold and could help Trump claim an even more definitive victory after arguments.\n\nOmar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, called the travel ban unconstitutional, saying, \"Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down.\"\n\nFox News Bill Mears' contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "type": "article"}
