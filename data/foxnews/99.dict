And we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists \u2026 That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe.\u201d\n\nThe federal appeals court temporarily blocked parts of Trump\u2019s executive orders and halted the travel ban, then denied the administration\u2019s request to immediately lift the ban. Critics of the ban argue it was hastily crafted with parts lacking adequate constitutional authority.\n\nTo be sure, uncertainty about the status of green card holders caused confusion and sparked major protests at international airports across the country on the Saturday after Trump signed the executive order, which was followed by administration officials promptly issuing guidance on legal permanent U.S. residents, or green card holders, to exempt them from the ban.\n\nFox News' Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-04", "type": "article"}
