Trump, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has now joined the ranks of the Ninth Circuit as one of the most out-of-control federal courts in the nation. Its May 25 decision upholding the injunction against President Trump\u2019s executive order implementing a temporary halt to entry of aliens from six terrorist countries was a political decision, not a legal decision.\n\nThe bias and prejudice that poisons the majority\u2019s political diatribe is encapsulated in an outrageous statement made right on page one. There, Judge Roger Gregory claims that the text of the executive order \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security\u201d but \u201cin context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d Then he makes the astounding claim that the executive order violates the First Amendment because it establishes \u201ca religious orthodoxy\u201d and favors \u201cone religion over another.\u201d The rest of the opinion resides in the same imaginary, Alice-in-Wonderland world that Gregory and his cohorts have created in their own minds about this issue.\n\nHow any judge could review the descriptions of these countries and dismiss them as \u201cvague\u201d can't really be explained \u2013 other than as judges substituting their judgment for that of the president, our intelligence agencies, the State Department, and the Pentagon when it comes to our national security.\n\nExecutive Order 13,780 is very straightforward. I defy any objective individual to read the order and conclude that it establishes a religious orthodoxy or \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d Further, there have been no statements made by any government officials, government agents, or elected individuals \u2013 including the president \u2013 during the term of this administration that provide any evidence of such an intent. (What may or may not have been said by individuals during a campaign when they were not government officials and had no governmental authority has no bearing on the legality and constitutionality of this order \u2013 particularly given the applicable Supreme Court precedent.)\n\nJudge Gregory erroneously asserts that there are only insufficiently \u201cvague words of national security\u201d concerns in the executive order. In fact, it explains why the president was attempting to suspend temporarily \u2013 for only 90 days \u2013 the entry of aliens from six countries (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) while the Department of Homeland Security determined whether its vetting procedures were sufficient to prevent the entry of terrorists into the United States.\n\nAs the text outlines, three of these countries have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism: Iran, Syria, and Sudan. The other three have failing governments and are safe havens for terrorists. The problems this causes range from an inability to trust any information or identity documents these countries provide, to the \u201cillicit flow of weapons\u2026and foreign terrorist fighters\u201d through these counties. Each of them is \u201ca state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.\u201d Any of \u201cthese circumstances diminishes the foreign government\u2019s willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States.\u2019\n\nHow any judge could review the descriptions of these countries in the executive order and cavalierly dismiss the U.S. government\u2019s concerns as \u201cvague\u201d and not sufficient cannot really be explained \u2013 other than as judges substituting their judgment and policy preferences for that of the president and our intelligence agencies, the State Department, and the Pentagon when it comes to our national security and the terrorism threat. And this decision by the Fourth Circuit would make any rational person question their judgment (which should really be referred to as misjudgment).\n\nThe three dissenting judges in this case, let by Judge Paul Niemeyer, point out the mistakes and deliberate errors made by the majority. As to the original district court that issued the injunction, Niemeyer outlines how that court \u201crefused to apply Kleindienst v. Mandel\u2026which held that courts are precluded from \u2018look[ing] behind\u2019 \u2018facially legitimate and bona fide\u2019 exercises of executive discretion in the immigration context to discern other possible motives.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Constitution \u201ccommits the power to make foreign policy, including the decision to permit or forbid entry into the United States, to the President and Congress.\u201d It does not give that power to the unelected judges of the Fourth or Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe district court, they also point out, \u201cseriously erred\u201d by \u201cfabricating a new proposition of law \u2013 indeed, a new rule \u2013 that provides for the consideration of campaign statements to recast a later-issued executive order\u201d and \u201cby radically extending Supreme Court Establishment Clause precedents.\u201d This \u201capproach is not only unprecedented, it is totally unworkable and inappropriate under any standard of analysis.\u201d\n\nMandel is the 1972 Supreme Court decision that governs any actions by Congress and the executive branch affecting aliens outside of our border who are seeking admission. This binding precedent severely limited the ability of courts to second-guess such a decision, holding that when the executive branch has exercised its authority to exclude aliens \u201con the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason,\u201d the courts cannot \u201clook behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against First Amendment interests\u201d of the plaintiffs.\n\nWhile the district court ignored the Mandel holding, the Fourth Circuit majority (according to Niemeyer) simply \u201creworked\u201d the district court\u2019s analysis by \u201capplying Mandel, albeit contrary to its holding, to defer only to the facial legitimacy of the Order but not to its facial bona fides, despite the Mandel Court\u2019s holding.\u201d Further, \u201cthe majority, after violating Mandel, then adopts the same new rule of law adopted by the district court to consider candidate Trump\u2019s campaign statements to find the Executive Order\u2019s stated reasons \u2018pretext[ual]\u2019\u2026and then to rewrite the Order to find it in violation of the Establishment Clause.\u201d That \u201ctoo is unprecedented and unworkable.\u201d\n\nThe Fourth Circuit has engaged in the same type of misbehavior that the Ninth Circuit did, as explained in a scathing dissent written by Ninth Circuit judges Jay Bybee, Alex Kozinski, Consuelo Callahan, Carlos Bea and Sandra Ikuta. As those judges said in that case, the U.S. Constitution \u201ccommits the power to make foreign policy, including the decision to permit or forbid entry into the United States, to the President and Congress.\u201d It does not give that power to the unelected judges of the Fourth or Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nDespite what these courts say, the president\u2019s executive order is lawful and fully within the constitutional authority delegated to him by Congress. It is not discriminatory and it does not violate the First Amendment. When all of these cases finally get to the Supreme Court, the Court will hopefully follow its own binding precedents and reverse all of these wrongly decided decisions. A contrary result would deeply damage our constitutional structure and endanger the safety of the nation.\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Justice Department official.
