On Sunday a federal appeals court denied the Justice Department's request for an immediate reinstatement of Trump's ban on accepting certain travelers and refugees. Formal arguments in the case will begin on Monday.\n\nThe wrestling competition will take place in the Iranian city of Kermanshah.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
