He signed a revised travel ban in March, and that also was blocked from implementation by judges.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump wrote in the first of four tweets. \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's tweets.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets come in the wake of Saturday\u2019s deadly London attacks, and an increasing string of Islamist assaults around the globe.\n\nBoth versions of the Trump travel ban prompted nationwide protests and fierce Democratic opposition. The ban's themselves were \"watered down\" versions of Trump's campaign proposal of a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "type": "article"}
