But there is no doubt about it \u2013 this was a significant and substantial victory despite the fact that the Court left a small portion of the injunctions issued by the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal in place.\n\nThe Court accepted the case for review, and oral arguments on the substantive merits of the claims will be heard when the Court starts its new term in October. Most importantly for the national security and safety of the nation, the Court slapped down the appeals courts by dissolving large portions of the injunctions issued against the executive order until the Court hears the case.\n\nThe March 6 executive order suspended for 90 days the entry of foreigners from six terrorist safe havens -- Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan -\u2013 while the government determines if it has the vetting procedures in place to prevent terrorists from getting into the country. The executive order applied a 120-day suspension to refugees for the same purpose, and capped the number of refugees allowed into the country at 50,000.\n\nThe Court lifted the injunctions on foreigners or refugees who have no connection to the U.S. According to the Court, the \u201cinterest in preserving national security is \u2018an urgent objective of the highest order\u2019\u201d and to prevent the government from \u201cpursuing that objective\u201d by not allowing these restrictions\u201cagainst foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else.\u201d\n\nBut the Court left in place the portion of the injunctions that would apply to any foreigner \u201cwho can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\n\nSome have painted this as setback to the administration, but that is also not true \u2013 it simply recognizes the procedures that the Trump administration had already put in place.\n\nAs the Court pointed out, the executive order \u201citself distinguishes between foreign nationals who have some connection to this country, and foreign nationals who do not, by establishing a case-by-case waiver system primarily for the benefit of individuals in the former category.\u201d Section 3(c) of the executive order provides special consideration for foreigners who have \u201csignificant contacts,\u201d \u201csignificant business or professional obligations,\u201d or family in the U.S., or who are admitted students or have employment offers in the country.\n\nThis is not much different than what the Court outlines would satisfy the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d standard. The Court says that for individuals, \u201ca close familial relationship is required.\u201d For entities, \u201cthe relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading\u201d the executive order.\n\nThus, students admitted to American universities and workers \u201cwho accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience\u201d would qualify.\n\nNo doubt to the annoyance of the advocacy groups who have filed these challenges, those who enter into a relationship \u201csimply to avoid\u201d the executive order will not qualify. For example, according to the Court, a \u201cnonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.\u201d\n\nThe other important detail to keep in mind is that this does not mean that foreigners who meet the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d requirement must be automatically granted a visa and admitted. They just have to be considered despite the ban on entry of other foreigners. Thus, the government will still be able to deny entry due to individual security issues or other problems that are routinely considered.\n\nSomething else that seems to have gotten lost in the reporting: this was a \u201cper curiam\u201d decision. That means that all nine justices agreed to lift the injunctions. The fact that none of the justices disagreed is another sign of how far out-of-line the lower court decisions were.\n\nThe only partial dissent by Justice Clarence Thomas (joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch) was to tell the Courtthat it should have lifted the injunctions in their entirety. He warned that the \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d standard set up by the Court will \u201cinvite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \u2018bona fide relationship,\u2019 who precisely has a \u2018credible claim\u2019 to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed \u2018simply to avoid\u2019\u201d the executive order.\n\nThomas, Alito and Gorsuch may be right about the flood of litigation, but we might have seen a similar such floodcontesting the very similar standards in the waiver program outlined in Section 3(c) of the executive order.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Supreme Court in large part agreed with the president. The tenor of this decision shows that the challengers will have a very hard time in the Fall convincing the Court that the president acted outside his statutory and constitutional authority. Or that federal judges should substitute their judgment for that of the president when it comes to national security.\n\nHans A. von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former Justice Department official.
