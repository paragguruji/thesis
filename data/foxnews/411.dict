The president issued a revised version in March. It never took effect after judges in Maryland and Hawaii put it on hold. Two federal appeals courts have since upheld those lower court orders.\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the ban to take effect immediately.\n\nGorsuch actually has been a member of the high court since April, and he even issued his first opinion on Monday.\n\nThe investiture ceremony typically takes place before a new justice's first day on the bench, but Gorsuch was confirmed and sworn in on a tight schedule.\n\nHe filled the seat that had been held for nearly 30 years by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. The high court seat was vacant for nearly 14 months after Senate Republicans refused to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-15", "type": "article"}
