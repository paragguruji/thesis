Trump revised the order in March, and it too was blocked.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the past decisions on the executive order.\n\nJan. 27\n\nTrump signed an executive order immediately barring entry into the U.S. for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nTRAVEL BAN: WHO DOES TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCK FROM ENTERING THE US?\n\nThe order, dubbed \u201cProtecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\u201d also halted the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, but indefinitely barred all Syrian refugees from the country.\n\nJan. 28\n\nA federal judge in New York issued an emergency order blocking, in part, the executive order. U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly\u2019s order temporarily barred the U.S. from deporting people who arrived with a valid visa or already completed refugee application.\n\nAs dozens of people were detained after their planes landed in the U.S., massive protests erupted at airports nationwide.\n\nJan. 29\n\nTwo federal judges in Boston issued a temporary stay on the travel ban, putting on hold for seven days the enforcement of the executive order.\n\nThe ruling stipulated that previously approved refugees, valid visa holders and lawful permanent residents or travelers from the seven countries included in Trump\u2019s order could not be detained or removed from the U.S. because of the executive order.\n\nJan. 30\n\nSenate Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats to overturn Trump\u2019s executive order. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., objected when Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sought to bring a vote to reverse the order.\n\nFeb. 3\n\nA Boston federal judged declined to extend a temporary injunction against the travel ban, leaving it in effect after the initial seven-day period ended on Feb. 5, pending appeal.\n\nWHO ARE THE THREE JUDGES WHO HEARD ARGUMENTS ON TRUMP TRAVEL BAN?\n\nBut U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle temporarily blocked the travel ban nationwide after Washington state and Minnesota urged a nationwide hold on the executive order. Robart said the state \u201cmet its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury.\u201d\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTrump excoriated Robart on Twitter, calling his ruling \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nFeb. 6\n\nThe Justice Department filed with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, imploring that the court reinstate Trump\u2019s travel ban. The department said Robart\u2019s ruling was \u201cvastly overbroad.\u201d\n\nSixteen state attorneys general filed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit against the travel ban. Those states included: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, D.C.\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE IN DC DECLINES TO ACT ON TRUMP TRAVEL BAN\n\nNearly 100 tech companies, including Apple and Google, also filed an amicus brief in opposition to the ban.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals began to hear oral arguments from the Justice Department as well as lawyers from the states of Washington and Minnesota who opposed the ban.\n\nFeb. 9\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decided to uphold the suspension of the executive order.\n\nThose judges were Michelle Friedland, appointed by former President Barack Obama; Richard Clifton, appointed by former President George W. Bush; and William Canby, appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nFeb. 10\n\nKellyanne Conway, a top advisor to the president, told Fox News that the court ruling \u201cdoes not affect the merits at all\u201d of the executive order.\n\n\u201cWe are fully confident now that we will get our day in court and have the opportunity to argue on the merits, that we will prevail,\u201d she said.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nA federal judge granted an injunction blocking the travel ban from being implemented in Virginia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found an unconstitutional religious bias with the travel ban, thus violating the First Amendment.\n\nUS JUDGE IN HAWAII LEAVES TRUMP TRAVEL BAN IN PLACE\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota argued that their case against the executive order should proceed in lower court. The Justice Department argued in its own filing for a moratorium on the case until the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decides if a full court will review the case.\n\nLater in the afternoon, a federal judge in Seattle ruled that the case could continue in lower court.\n\nFeb. 15\n\nTexas Attorney Gen. Ken Paxton filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of Trump\u2019s executive order and asked the court to reconsider its decision to block the travel ban.\n\nMarch 6\n\nTrump signed a new executive order which barred travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days\u2014 removing Iraq.\n\nThe new order also exempted permanent residents and current visa holders from the travel ban.\n\n13 STATES URGE APPEALS COURT TO OK TRUMP TRAVEL BAN\n\nIt also did not include language that could allow for those of a certain religion to get preferential treatment, the New York Times reported.\n\nSyrian refugees were still banned in the new executive order but only for 120 days instead of indefinitely.\n\nMarch 8\n\nThe state of Hawaii moved to block the new executive order in court. The state\u2019s attorney general, Doug Chin, said the travel ban would be detrimental to the state\u2019s economy and educational institutions.\n\nMarch 15\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii halted the new executive order mere hours before it went into effect.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson temporarily halted the travel ban with a restraining order.\n\nREPUBLICAN-APPOINTED JUDGES ON 9TH CIRCUIT VOICE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP TRAVEL BAN\n\nThe Justice Department called the ruling \u201cflawed both in reasoning and scope.\u201d\n\nMarch 16\n\nU.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, sitting in Maryland, also temporarily halted the executive order.\n\nChuang argued that the order specifically targeted Muslims, and his ruling blocked the part of the travel ban that prevented the issuance of visas to people from the six countries.\n\nMeanwhile, five Republican-appointed judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voiced their support of the legality of the executive order.\n\n\"Whatever we, as individuals, may feel about the President or the Executive Order, the President's decision was well within the powers of the presidency,\" the judges said.\n\nMarch 29\n\nWatson, the federal judge in Hawaii, extended his order that blocked Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nMarch 30\n\nThe Trump administration appealed Watson\u2019s ruling with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMay 8\n\nThe Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals began to hear the case of Trump\u2019s travel ban to determine whether it\u2019s an overreach on Trump\u2019s authority.\n\nTRUMP TRAVEL BAN: WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS INTERPRETATION OF RULING\n\nThis hearing was the first of two appeals in May; the other hearing is with the 9th Circuit in California.\n\nMay 11\n\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to grant a request to halt Trump's executive order as two other judges already ruled to halt the travel ban.\n\nMay 25\n\nThe 4th Circuit blocked the Trump administration from implementing the travel ban.\n\n\u201cWe remain unconvinced [the ban] has more to do with national security than it does with effectuating the President\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\" the court said in its 10-3 ruling.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said that the Justice Department would request a review of the appeals court ruling from the Supreme Court. Sessions said the Justice Department \u201cstrongly\u201d disagreed with the ruling and will continue to defend the order.\n\nThe court ruling blocked Trump\u2019s \u201cefforts to strengthen this country\u2019s national security,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nPresident Trump, Sessions added, isn\u2019t required to admit people from \u201ccountries that sponsor or shelter terrorism until he determines that they can be properly vetted\u201d and that they do not pose a security threat.\n\nJune 26\n\nThe Supreme Court is allowing President Donald Trump to forge ahead with a limited version of his ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries to the U.S. Trump hailed the decision as a \"victory for national security,\" but it's likely to set off a new round of court disputes over anti-terror efforts and religious discrimination.\n\nThe nation\u2019s highest court ruled Monday that justices will hear arguments in October in the case. Until then, the court said, Trump\u2019s ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can be enforced if those visitors lack a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe State Department said it will implement the travel ban 72 hours after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling \u2014 meaning it will go into effect the morning of June 29.\n\nJuly 13\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii expanded the scope of the travel ban \u2013 allowing additional family members to come to the U.S.\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ruled that a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d needed before entering the U.S. can include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people already in the U.S.\n\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court asking for clarification.\n\nJuly 19\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday partially granted the Trump administration another victory on its travel ban as it ruled that its strict enforcement on its refugee ban could stay in place \u2013 at least until a federal appeals court weighs in.\n\nHowever, the justices did leave in place a lower court order that makes it easier for travelers from six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S.\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled last week that the government should allow in refugees formally working with a resettlement agency in the U.S. He also expanded the family relations that refugees and visitors can use to get into the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Wednesday Watson\u2019s order as it applies to refugees but allowed the expanded list of refugees to stay. The justices said the federal appeals court in San Francisco should consider the appeal.\n\nIt is unclear how quickly that will happen.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "type": "article"}
