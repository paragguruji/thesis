She said the stop was based on information discovered during the agency\u2019s review. She did not elaborate.\n\nDehnavi was arriving in the U.S. to start work at a prominent Boston hospital.\n\nBoston Children\u2019s Hospital said in a statement earlier Tuesday that Dehnavi was prevented from entering the country with his wife and three young children despite holding a J-1 visa for visiting scholars.\n\n\u201cBoston Children\u2019s hopes that this situation will be quickly resolved and Dr. Dehnavi and his family will be released and allowed to enter the U.S.,\u201d hospital spokesman Rob Graham said in the statement. \u201c\n\nBut Malin noted that visa applicants \u201cbear the burden of proof\u201d to meet all requirements and can be denied entry for a range of reasons, including health-related issues, criminality or security concerns.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently ruled the Trump administration could largely enforce its temporary ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. But the court said the ban can\u2019t block people with a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nSome advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Iranian American Council, suggested the detention might be a violation of the Supreme Court order.\n\n\u201cThe family is very worried,\u201d said Shayan Modarres, a lawyer for the D.C.-based council, which has been in contact with the family. \u201cIf it is a minor paperwork issue, then something needs to be told to the family so they can resolve it.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, the incident shows how the administration\u2019s political priorities are leading to \u201coverzealous enforcement\u201d of immigration laws, said Gregory Romanovsky, chair of the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyer\u2019s Association.\n\n\u201cExercising discretion is not what they\u2019re comfortable doing anymore, especially if they\u2019re dealing with someone from one of the six banned countries,\u201d he said of local customs officials. \u201cThe travel ban and the whole anti-immigrant mood coming from the very top of this administration certainly affects their ability.\u201d\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, told reporters he was waiting to hear more about the Dehnavis\u2019 circumstances, but also suggested the case was an example of concerns with the travel ban.\n\n\u201cMany people, doctors and nurses and people who are students working in the world-class institutions that we have are going to be boxed out or left out of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-07-12", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["doctor", "travel", "blame", "dont", "patrol", "family", "ban", "visa", "court", "cancer", "iranian", "american", "trumps", "country", "border", "told", "detained", "dehnavi", "sent"], "summary": "The Iranian cancer researcher who was detained at Boston's Logan International Airport along with his family and sent back to his home country on Tuesday was not a result of President Trump's travel ban, a spokeswoman from U.S. Customs and Border Partol said.\nStephanie Malin, the spokeswoman, said Moshen Dehnavi and his family were detained for \u201creasons unrelated\u201d to Trump\u2019s executive order.\nThe Supreme Court recently ruled the Trump administration could largely enforce its temporary ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\u201cThe family is very worried,\u201d said Shayan Modarres, a lawyer for the D.C.-based council, which has been in contact with the family.\n\u201cThe travel ban and the whole anti-immigrant mood coming from the very top of this administration certainly affects their ability.\u201dBoston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, told reporters he was waiting to hear more about the Dehnavis\u2019 circumstances, but also suggested the case was an example of concerns with the travel ban."}
