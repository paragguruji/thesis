Here is what you need to know about the executive order:\n\nWhat does President Trump\u2019s executive order do?\n\nThe purpose of the executive order is detecting \u201cindividuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States\u201d for 90 days if they come from any of seven countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order suspends those granted refugee status for 120 days while the Trump administration reviews and reworks immigration screening procedures.\n\nThe order also states that refugees who are already in the process of being vetted may be admitted to the United States, but only after undergoing the revised screening processes.\n\nThe Seven Countries\n\nAlthough the order is being characterized as a \"Muslim ban,\" which Trump discussed during his campaign, it is worth noting that President Trump did not cherry-pick these seven countries.\n\n\u201cThe seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\u201d noting that there are at least 40 countries that are predominantly Muslim that \u201care not affected\u201d by the order.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply irresponsible to characterize this Executive Order as a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 -- it is not,\u201d Chairman of House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News. \u201cThe order puts a pause on refugee admissions and temporarily halts immigration from seven countries, each of which was already designated by the Obama administration as an area of terror concern.\u201d\n\nThe seven countries were originally flagged by the Obama administration for the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, which restricted access to U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Visa Waiver Program for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration added three additional countries, which are reflected in President Trump\u2019s executive order: Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe executive order asks for streamlined communications and information from departments of State and Homeland Security, along with the intelligence community, about the listed countries to ensure those who seek entry into the U.S. are not a \u201csecurity or public safety threat.\u201d The countries have 60 days to start giving the information to the United States and, if they don\u2019t, those seeking entry will be prohibited from entering the United States.\n\nGreen Card and Visa holders affected?\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said that President Trump\u2019s order did apply to green card holders traveling to the United States from those seven countries. The White House confirmed this position Saturday night, and said that green card holders would be evaluated on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and federal courts in Brooklyn, Boston and Virginia blocked the government from enforcing the executive order against visa and green-card holders.\n\nThe next day, on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus changed the stance.\n\n\u201cAs far as green card holders, moving forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an American citizen traveling back and forth to Libya, you are likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport.\u201d He also noted that customs and border patrol agents have \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d when they suspect someone is \u201cup to no good\u201d when they travel back and forth to countries listed in the order.\n\nWhat is the global reaction?\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry and the Iraqi parliament have approved \u201creciprocity measures\u201d -- meaning U.S. citizens cannot enter the countries until the ban is lifted.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid bin Ra\u2019ad Zeid al-Hussein, took to Twitter on Monday morning saying that \u201cdiscrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law,\u201d and calling President Trump\u2019s action \u201cmean-spirited.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, among others, expressed their disagreement and concern.\n\nBut President Trump received support from Czech President Milos Zeman. A spokesperson for Zeman said \u201cU.S. President Trump protects his country. He\u2019s concerned with the safety of his citizens. Exactly what EU elites do not do.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSenate Democrats are expected to roll out legislation Monday evening in an effort to repeal Trump's order.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., will introduce two bills. The first would rescind the executive order, and the second would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure additional congressional oversight of the president\u2019s authority to bar classes of people from entering the United States, according to Feinstein\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cPainting more than 200 million people with the same broad brush is contrary to the principles on which this nation was founded and will not make us any safer,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
