It also placed restrictions on refugees entering the country.\n\nA reporter asked Ferguson if the ruling coming down on Friday afternoon could cause confusion.\n\n\"I'll tell you where there's been confusion - the President's executive order,\" Ferguson said. \"That's what's caused confusion. I'm sorry, but there's no other way to put it - it's been Keystone Cops. It really is. That's not just me speaking, that's Republican members of Congress.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James L. Robart, a Seattle native who is an appointee of President George W. Bush, said the state of Washington proved that local economy and citizens have suffered irreparable harm and an injunction should be applied.\n\n\"What the judge ruled today is that the president's executive order does not apply -- does not apply,\" Ferguson said after the hearing.\n\n\"I'm sure the president won't like this decision, but it's his obligation to honor the law and I'll make sure he does,\" Ferguson told reporters.\n\nRobart is no stranger to high-profile cases - he is also the federal judge in charge of overseeing the reform of the Seattle Police Department.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM Q13 FOX.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
