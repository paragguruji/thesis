Organizers say hundreds of the stores around the city are expected to take part, to show how much they're a part of the fabric of New York City. They estimate several thousand of the neighborhood stores are owned by Yemenis.\n\nTrump's executive order barring people hailing from Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria for 90 days has resulted in travelers being detained or sent back from the United States as well as stranded in other countries.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
