And that the president\u2019s executive authority in protecting the country and enforcing immigration laws in this matter is beyond judicial review.\n\nThe order would temporarily halt refugees from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country. It also freezes refugee admissions so intelligence and security officials can review existing admission procedures.\n\nThis will be the second time the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has heard a government appeal on this matter. Earlier this year a different panel of judges affirmed a lower court injunction against the president\u2019s similar first travel ban order, which he revoked in issuing his second version.\n\nSeveral weeks ago Trump blasted the Ninth Circuit saying his opponents are \u201cjudge shopping\u201d in the court that covers the western United States.\n\nThe three judges hearing Monday\u2019s case were randomly chosen from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s members--all three were appointed by President Clinton. While some other Ninth Circuit judges have said the president\u2019s order is on sound legal ground \u2013 they were not impaneled on either case.\n\n\u201cThe president seeks to enact a thinly veiled Muslim ban, shorn of procedural protections and premised on the belief that those who practice Islam are a danger to our country,\u201d says plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Neal Katyal who represents the state of Hawaii and an Imam who lives in the islands.\n\nThey argue the travel ban is unconstitutional because it disfavors Muslims. The ban also, allegedly, harms Hawaii\u2019s economy and university community by cutting off potential tourists and student applicants from overseas. \u201cThe order is the embodiment of a policy of religious animus,\u201d Katyal argues. \u201cThe government\u2019s only real response is to ask the court to close its eyes to abundant evidence of discrimination.\u201d\n\nBoth sides will get 30 minutes to present their arguments. A live camera feed will also originate from inside the courtroom.\n\nLast week in Richmond, Virginia, another federal appellate court heard similar arguments over the president\u2019s order. Either case \u2013 or both \u2013 could end up before the Supreme Court.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "type": "article"}
