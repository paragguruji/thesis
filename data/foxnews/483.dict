And it comes after weeks of consultation with agency heads over legal issues and implementation.\n\nThe scaled-back order still faces critics who question whether it actually will make the U.S. safer in the long run.\n\nThe new order bars new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily shuts down America's refugee program, affecting would-be visitors and immigrants from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.\n\nBut the new ban eliminates many of the original order's most contentious elements. It removes Iraq from the list of banned countries and makes clear that current visa holders will not be impacted.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "type": "article"}
