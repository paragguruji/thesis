The panel unanimously rejected the administration's claim of presidential authority in the matter.\n\nThe Trump administration has not filed an official appeal of the panel's ruling with the U.S. Supreme Court or an appellate panel.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "type": "article"}
