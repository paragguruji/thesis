In that case, his administration could continue a legal fight for his first order all while crafting another.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that we\u2019ll win that particular case,\u201d Trump said at the White House, during a press conference alongside visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe Justice Department is weighing its options, which also include appealing to a broader panel of judges or the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision Thursday was made by a panel of three judges with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco.\n\nIn their unanimous decision , the judges refused to reinstate Trump's immigration order and rejected the government\u2019s position that such presidential decisions on immigration policy are \u201cunreviewable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201c\u2026Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe initial order, which was signed Jan. 27, suspended entry for visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days and froze the entire U.S. refugee program, The Journal reported.\n\nJosh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the \"million-dollar question\" is whether the Trump administration would appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThat could run the risk of having only eight justices to hear the case, which could produce a tie and leave the lower-court ruling in place.\n\n\"There's a distinct risk in moving this too quickly,\" Blackman said. \"But we're not in a normal time, and Donald Trump is very rash. He may trump, pardon the figure of speech, the normal rule.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
