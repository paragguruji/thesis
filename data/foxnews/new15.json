In fact the racing parlor (in con man lingo the \u201cstore,\u201d which looks like a legitimate business but is in fact a complete sham) where he places the bet is a phony set-up, and Redford and Newman get away with his money scot free.\n\nThis is exactly what the Democratic Party has done for decades. The grifters in this case are Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The store is the mainstream media from NY Times to NBC and CNN and the mob are the rent-a-crowd demonstrators who turn up to make a fuss in front the store\u2019s cameras, whether it\u2019s in the Women\u2019s March last weekend or at the San Francisco Airport this weekend.\n\nWho are the marks? They\u2019re gullible Republicans whom the Democrat grifters and the media con into believing the American public wants them to stand behind a Democratic initiative in a show of bipartisanship, or to oppose a Republican one on the grounds that\u2019s it\u2019s too extreme. The promised score is popularity among moderates and independents, as well as mention in the New York Times as a principled conservative or maverick for breaking with their party\u2014when in fact it\u2019s the Democrats who actually win and the Republican mark who loses with his own base thanks to the sting.\n\nThat\u2019s what happening with the media hysteria over Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d(in fact it\u2019s a temporary ban that effects exactly seven countries, ones on which the Obama administration already placed travel limits as \u201ccountries of concern\u201d) and it\u2019s what going to erupt when Trump announces his Supreme Court pick on Tuesday night.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-worn con by this time. Democrats used it to convince GOP moderates we were losing the Vietnam War and that Americans wanted us to pull out (in fact poll after poll showed the public supported the war until the very end). They\u2019ve used it to claim the public wants stricter gun control laws, and opposes any federal spending cuts or government shutdown. More recently they\u2019ve used it to convince GOP marks that if they were going to win over Hispanics they have to support amnesty for illegal immigrants; and that waterboarding is \u201ctantamount to torture.\u201d\n\nBut their biggest score was in 1974 when the Democrat/media con game was able to peel off enough Republicans to impeach Richard Nixon and force him to resign\u2014a score they later tried and failed with Ronald Reagan over Iran-Contra, but now hope to see repeated with President Trump.\n\nIn addition, they know some GOP marks keep coming back for more, even when they\u2019ve been taken. There\u2019s John McCain, for example, whom they stung in the 2008 presidential race, but is still willing to act as \u201cmaverick\u201d on issues like waterboarding and Trump\u2019s relations with Vladimir Putin. There was Marco Rubio on comprehensive immigration \u201creform,\u201d until he wised up and saw that Chuck Schumer and others were just playing him as a sucker.\n\nBecause Republicans slowly are wising up, just as the public has. They are realizing what CNN and the New York Times present as the burning issues of our time\u2014police violence against blacks or the \u201chacked election\u201d a couple weeks ago or this weekend\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d--are really all part of the sting. That\u2019s going to make the Democrat grifters\u2019 job harder this time. It will also make it easier to blow the whistle on the scammers, as Trump advisor Steve Bannon did when he branded the mainstream media \u201cthe opposition party\u201d\u2014although the opposition\u2019s phony \u201cstore\u201d would be more accurate.\n\nIn the movie \"The Sting\" one of the grifters says about the mark, \u201cHe\u2019s not as tough as he looks.\u201d The other replies sheepishly, \u201cNeither are we.\u201d Neither are the Democrats, once you catch on to their big con.\n\nHistorian Arthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.
