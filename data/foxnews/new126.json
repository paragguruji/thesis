Patrick Leahy struggled to pin down Judge Neil Gorsuch Tuesday on President Trump's controversial travel ban, as the Supreme Court nominee smoothly sidestepped questions relating to the policy currently on hold by the courts.\n\nGorsuch instead directed the contentious cross-examination into more general terrain where Gorsuch could advocate for religious liberty, without commenting on the specifics of the case.\n\n\u201cI will apply the law,\u201d Gorsuch vowed, during the second day of his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nLeahy initially had tried to get the 10th Circuit Court judge to comment on the notion of a \u201creligious litmus test for entry into the United States,\u201d in apparent reference to Trump's attempt to suspend immigration and travel from six mostly Muslim countries and the refugee program.\n\nGorsuch parried, refusing to discuss issues that could come before a court he sits on.\n\n\u201cWould the president have the authority to ban all Jews from America? Or all people that come from Israel? Would that be an easy question?\u201d Leahy asked.\n\n\u201cSenator, we have a Constitution, and it does guarantee free exercise. It also guarantees equal protection of the laws. And a whole lot else besides,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201c\u2026 I will apply the law faithfully and fearlessly and without regard to persons.\u201d\n\nLeahy countered: \u201cHow about in regards to religion?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone, any law is gonna get a fair and square deal with me,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nAsked about a hypothetical religious test to serve in the military, Gorsuch finally yielded, calling such a proposed rule \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cagainst the law.\u201d\n\nLeahy then posed the question a different way, using the language of then-candidate Trump to ask about a hypothetical ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump has since ditched the incendiary rhetoric when speaking about travel bans, though a reference remains on his campaign website. Leahy also cited an unnamed Republican congressman who allegedly said \u201cthe best thing the president could do for his Muslim ban is to make sure he has Gorsuch on the Supreme Court before appeals get to that point.\u201d\n\nThe typically genial Gorsuch turned serious.\n\n\u201cSenator, he has no idea how I\u2019d rule in that case and, senator, I\u2019m not going to say anything here that\u2019s going to give anybody any idea how I\u2019d rule in any case like that that could come before the Supreme Court or my court on the 10th Circuit,\u201d Gorsuch said, tapping a pointed finger on his desk to emphasize his words. \u201cIt would be grossly improper of a judge to do that. It would be a violation of the separation of powers and judicial independence if someone sitting at this table, in order to get confirmed, had to make promises or commitments about how they\u2019d rule in a case that\u2019s currently pending and likely to make its way to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nLeahy took one last shot at driving a wedge between Gorsuch and the president who nominated him, asking if \u201ca president\u2019s national security determinations\u201d are reviewable.\n\nGorsuch replied: \u201cSenator, no man is above the law.\u201d", "authors": ["Cody Derespina"], "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["leahy", "questions", "travel", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "court", "gorsuch", "rule", "religious", "rebuffs", "president", "law"], "summary": "Democratic Sen.
