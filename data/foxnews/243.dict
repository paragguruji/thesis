The final number of signatories will not be available until it is submitted, the officials said. The officials disclosed internal discussions on condition they not be quoted by name, in part because they feared retaliation.\n\nDissent channel cables are a mechanism for U.S. diplomats to register disagreement internally about U.S. policies. It was established during the Vietnam War and was most recently used by diplomats to criticize the Obama administration's approach to Syria.\n\nSpicer defended the executive order and said its impact had been \"blown way out of proportion and exaggerated.\"\n\nThe State Department's official response was less confrontational.\n\n\"The Dissent Channel is a longstanding official vehicle for State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,\" department spokesman Mark Toner said. \"This is an important process that the acting secretary, and the department as a whole, value and respect. It allows State employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
