{"title": "What's next for President Trump's travel ban?", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/03/16/what-next-for-president-trump-travel-ban.html", "text": "This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" March 16, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\"\n\nPresident Trump is vowing to fight after his revised travel ban is put on hold just hours before it was set to begin yesterday. A federal judge in Hawaii issued a nationwide restraining order rejecting the government's national security claim. A second judge in Maryland also ruled against the president's executive order. A fired-up Mr. Trump slammed the move in the Aloha state at his rally last night in Nashville.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order. This is the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach. We are going to fight this terrible rule. We are going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court. We are going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe. And regardless, we are going to keep our citizens safe, believe me. I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system. And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me. Not today, not ever.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBOLLING: OK, Dana, so a constitutional lawyer and a former Harvard professor, Alan Dershowitz, a Democrat, said this about the temporary travel ban. He said don't confuse constitutionality with bad policy. And then, he went on to say he thinks it's bad policy, but constitutional.\n\nDANA PERINO, CO-HOST: And not to be fair, right. The judges' ruling was 43 cases. It's not like he wrote it overnight. I think it was probably being prepared. As President Trump said, it's a watered-down version of what they had before. One of the things that I think that was really weird about it is that he said it's discriminatory towards immigrants, but if you are not yet in America, if you are not an American citizen yet, you can't be discriminated against yet. So it is like prescriptive discrimination. I don't think it will hold up in court. But you're going to have to deal with these issues with the court in a way, and I'm sure the justice department was prepared for these appeals because they knew that this was going to happen.\n\nBOLLING: They might come back at it. KG.\n\nKIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah.\n\nBOLLING: The U.S. district court judge, Derrick Watson, an Obama nominee, also a classmate of President Obama, or Barack Obama, at Harvard. Your thoughts.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Cozy legal pals, right. Again, Dana I think brings up a great point. They knew this was coming. They already had the previous executive order, so they were able and prepared to act. They probably had a draft written, waiting for this opportunity to be the one to put it forward. I'm just so surprised and also disappointed at the amount of you know politics involved here. People really pushing for their ideology, and in fact, misunderstanding the law saying it's discriminatory when the people don't even have those constitutionally protected rights. They are not U.S. citizens. So therefore, they are making a legal claim that they don't have the basis for in terms of saying that.\n\nSo for me, I think, you know, you would hope that a certain point, I don't see anything on its face examining this executive order, they tried to address in good faith the problems that people have with it in the past. So they amended it. They put forward a revised one which should pass any kind of constitutional muster.\n\nBOLLING: Greg, it seems to be like this endless stream of pushback on everything.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes, it doesn't matter what he does. They're going to hate the travel ban no matter what. They watered it down, so the ban travel solely from Vatican City, they would call it Islamaphobic because that's how it is. This is not even political. It's personal. The constitutional argument is merely camouflage. It's a costume. Because right now, you are dealing with a large segment of our society who are dealing emotionally over President Trump, and they are allowing their emotions or take priority over policy. The Republicans are concerned with safety. The Democrats are concerned with feelings. I mean, by the way, this happened with Obama, too. They were a lot of Republicans that let their emotions get the best over him.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: He had to push a lot in court, too. He got pushed back a lot on his EPA rulings, and taxes in particular. The judges there would say oh, I don't think so. And then, the justice department would have to fight back for Obama.\n\nGUTFELD: But, Hawaii, come on.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: This is the same state that tried to send their homeless to the Mainland with one-way tickets. I don't know if you remember that story. But you know, you talk about compassion, that was their solution. Let's get the homeless out of here.\n\nBOLLING: I think President Obama was in Hawaii at the time of the travel ban when this judge made this ruling.\n\nGUTFELD: Yesterday.\n\nBOLLING: Juan, the American people spoke. They elected President Donald J. Trump. The obstructionism, I agree with Dana that a lot of it happened during President Obama's terms. We are talking 56 days, though. He has been pushed back on everything he has tried to roll out.\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, let's stick with this for just a second because I guess think there is a larger argument about everything, obstructionism, of course. Obstructionism is best known from the Obama years. But let's just talk about this for a second. First of all, I think this is a matter of the ruling, it's interesting to note that Donald Trump's lawyers made the case that you can't look into his mind and decide if, in fact, he is trying to effectuate a ban against Muslims, which is the argument coming from the courts. But the court responded that there is nothing veiled about the press releases. So they looked at the press releases during the campaign.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: Right. In which Donald Trump has said that he is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. So in response to Kimberly's point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: That's not what the executive order says though, Juan. Yes, he did make some claims on the campaign trail, but so now this judge is ruling on something a politician said during a campaign rather than what the actual document is saying and policy.\n\nWILLIAMS: Because what he is saying -- what the judge is saying and by the way, it's not just the judge in Hawaii, Greg. It's also now a judge in Maryland.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Maryland, yeah.\n\nWILLIAMS: That you have a situation where a politician is trying to you know just dance around the edges so he can effectuate a Muslim ban.\n\nBOLLING: How is it a Muslim ban?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: There are Muslim countries that are not in this ban. They answered that question. We know what this is about. It's about the manipulation of the doctrines of that it's toxic and deadly, and we don't want it in our country.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: I thought it was unfair of you to say Democrats don't care about safety.\n\nGUTFELD: It wasn't fair. I agree, but I still believe it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPERINO: Isn't it fun? Take that to court.\n\nBOLLING: Liberals saying conservatives don't care about clean air and clean water.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: That is exactly the point. They tell us that Republicans are uncaring. We hate children paired, we hate old people. So that's my response, you don't care about safety.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: I think there are a lot of old people who are Republicans.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: Those babies don't vote. You know that.\n\nBOLLING: Last night, President Trump also talked about building the border wall and took another shot at the media.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: As you probably read, we went out to bid. We had hundreds of bidders. Everybody wants to build our wall. Usually that means we're going to get a good price. We are going to get a good price, believe me.\n\nSome of the fake news said I don't think Donald Trump wants to build the wall. Can you imagine if I said we're not going to build the wall? Fake news. Fake, fake news. Thank news, folks. A lot of fake.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBOLLING: KG, fake news.\n\nGUILFOYLE: It's pretty funny. He does have a pretty good delivery and inflection when he says it. You can tell he likes it. But he is saying it, too, because his supporters, the people part of his movement, they believe that. They believe it. He was saying it during the campaign. And every time that he believes it, he has proof to say look at this, fake news. Can you imagine if I didn't want to build the wall? I think he has to build the wall. That's one of the things you've got to check the box on. I think is going to do it and you know, the rest is going to come down to the details of whose cash registers gets open to pay for it.\n\nBOLLING: And, Dana, putting your money where your mouth is, so to speak, Mick Mulvaney today, budget director, told us that $1.5 billion in this year's budget, $2.6 billion in the next year's budget, earmarked for building the wall.\n\nPERINO: Right, they will have to take it to congress and see if they can get it done.\n\nBOLLING: You don't think they can?\n\nPERINO: No, I'm not saying that. I don't know if they can get it done. It depends on how many you know -- they're going to have to do some deal- making. And they've got a lot of pieces. We are going to talk about that in the C block, I guess though, all the different things that they are going to do to get to this budget. It's not a big number, $1.5 billion. It doesn't shock the conscience. Could that get approved? It's possible. It might be tough to get it through the senate.\n\nBOLLING: One-one thousandth of the budget.\n\nGUTFELD: It's not much. He better not be Rachel Maddow-ing us with this stuff.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: Stop teasing us on how we are going to pay for it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: I know. I'm still going through that period. The simplest way is to crowd fund and crowd source and crowd build it. You know, make it into an event. Like you know in companies, they have those bonding exercises, just have a big bonding exercise for Americans to come down and build this thing together. You pay a fee, you get a plaque just like in a hospital. You build a wing for a hospital, you get a plaque. There is a little Perino wall, there is this little Gutfeld wall smaller than those walls.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: We should have built it higher.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: You can use Mexicans to build the wall. That's part of the way they can pay for it.\n\nWILLIAMS: I think Mexico should pay for the wall.\n\nPERINO: Are you going to pay them?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWILLIAMS: No, no, no, no.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUILFOYLE: I could see it.\n\nBOLLING: You could pay them.\n\nWILLIAMS: Have Mexico pay them.\n\nBOLLING: There you go. Bingo, Juan Williams solved the wall problems.\n\nWILLIAMS: I'm trying. I am working over here.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: You know, I am trying to cooperate here but let me just say.\n\nBOLLING: Bipartisan solution to the wall.\n\nWILLIAMS: Your problem is Republicans.\n\nBOLLING: Yeah, well.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: Dana was so nice to you. But, Dana, didn't just tell you, Republicans and the Republican leadership in the house and the senate do not think you can go around and cut everything and say were going to give billions for the wall.\n\nBOLLING: Let's be real, guys. Do you think Donald Trump would have a problem finding $1.5 billion with Republicans who have to go to him and say hey, I need this in my state? I need this in my district.\n\nPERINO: There is no earmarking anymore, though.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: There is campaigning.\n\nPERINO: That's true.\n\nWILLIAMS: The promise was Mexico is going to pay for the wall.\n\nBOLLING: You just solved that problem.\n\nWILLIAMS: But I'm just telling you, that was the promise.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: The promise to his supporters, to Trump voters was Mexico will pay for the wall, not you are going to pay for the wall, Eric Bolling.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: There are many ways.\n\nGUTFELD: Juan, you are living in a parallel universe. The universe where the things you say before the elections still matter. Once you win, the chop board is clean and you can start over.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUILFOYLE: Blank slate. John Locke.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. Well done, Kimberly.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: Coming up, yes, it is Tucker Time. After his huge interview with President Trump last night, Tucker joins us with more on his exclusive one- on-one with the commander-in-chief next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nPERINO: During last night's exclusive interview with Tucker Carlson, President Trump addressed his claim that President Obama wire-tapped Trump Tower during the campaign.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: For the most part, I'm not going to discuss it because we have it before the committee and we will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasn't been submitted as of yet. But it's potentially a very serious.\n\nYou take a look at some of the things written about wiretapping and eavesdropping. And don't forget, when I say wiretapping, those words were in quote. That really covers because wiretapping is pretty old fashioned stuff. But that really covers surveillance and many other things. I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPERINO: All right. Then this afternoon, Senate Intelligence leaders said that there is no evidence Mr. Trump was the subject of surveillance. That didn't stop Sean Spicer, the press secretary, from doubling down at today's press briefing.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEAN SPICER, PRESS SECRETARY: I think the president has been clear. He talked about this and he talked about it last night. He talked about wiretapping, he meant surveillance. And there have been incidents that occurred. Devin Nunes couldn't say it more beautifully, but you chose not to cover that part.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They don't see any evidence of wiretapping so how can the president go on and continue?\n\nSPICER: Because you are mischaracterizing what Chairman Nunes said. The bottom-line is that the investigation or the house and the senate have not been provided all of the information.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPERINO: Joining us with more is our friend and colleague, Tucker Carlson. Great interview last night. I have a question for you, Tucker. Why not when the senate intel committee comes out and says there's no evidence why wouldn't the White House cannot say, I'm so glad, President Obama was not wiretapping. That's one we can all move on and talk about something else. Instead he makes news and says we expect to see more in the next two weeks.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT SHOW HOST: They believe they were monitored, that members of the campaign team were surveilled in some form by the Obama administration, by the intel agencies over whom President Obama had authority. And I think that's probably true, actually. But we know that the NSA has the capacity to basically absorb almost every electronic communication in the United States. And that it does, to some extent, spy on America to the extent we don't fully understand both because it's not public and because the intel community don't push to find out the intent of it. So there's a lot of this going on and we know that the previous administration was worried about Russian interference long before the campaign. And it's not implausible. The problem is whenever you communicate this incompletely and inarticulately and imprecisely by tweet, you step on your own story. How much easier would it have been to call up Mike Pompeo or anybody in any agencies and say this is our suspicion, get to the bottom of it, report back, and we will communicate it with the public. That would have been the right way to do it.\n\nPERINO: We're going to have more of the stories I guess because we will continue to have to look at it. There's a hearing on Monday. The way we do it on The Five when you are on is we take it around the table. So Eric Bolling is going to be next.\n\nBOLLING: Tucker, I do have a question. I agree with you. I think you and I see similarly that the NSA has the capacity and is actively data mining everything we do. But here's the difference here. Was there a specific person or persons targeted at Trump Tower? Now, we are hearing today that possibly there wasn't or there weren't. But yet, we still do know that there was a FISA request in June that was turned down and a FISA request for the warrant that was accepted. What was that for?\n\nCARLSON: Right.\n\nBOLLING: I mean, clearly, they had to be naming someone there, right? Am I missing this?\n\nCARLSON: Here is the question. And I have asked this to a couple people on the intel committees. Does electronic communication reside currently in U.S. government servers in various intelligence agencies that came from or was going to Trump Tower during the campaign? And you can't get anybody to categorically say no. I think there probably is. Does this mean there was a spying effort against the Trump campaign? Not necessarily, but it raises a really important question, which is to what extent is the U.S. government spying on its own citizens?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBOLLING: But, Tucker, just hone in on that accepted FISA weren't offered in October before the election. They had to have -- if you are going to spy or you are going to do that with an American, you need a positive warrant that, from the FISA court, and they got it. Isn't it logic that says there is in fact someone at Trump Tower that they were surveilling?\n\nCARLSON: I don't know if physically in Trump Tower but yes, that has been reported. By the way, I don't think it's technically true that the president himself would need such a warrant to conduct surveillance. I think he had that latitude legally, anyway. But no, we know they went twice for such a warrant before the FISA court and were twice turned down. This is a court that has 99 percent of its request are accepted. There's a lot we don't know. Here's the point that bugs me. We have a right to know a lot of this. And if the explanation is we are fighting Islamic terrorism. It's too important for you to know about it. But at some point, your average citizen has an absolute right to know what his government is doing. And we don't. And it's infuriating.\n\nPERINO: All right. Juan Williams.\n\nWILLIAMS: Tucker, I was taken by this statement issued today by Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and the vice chair that panel Mark Warner.\n\nCARLSON: Right.\n\nWILLIAMS: Because they talked about surveillance. They did not talk about wiretapping. They said there was no evidence of surveillance.\n\nCARLSON: Right.\n\nWILLIAMS: That's all inclusive. So the question for you is when you sit with President Trump and he says to you we've got more coming, Tucker. You know, we got stuff, just wait. What do you think he's talking about?\n\nCARLSON: Well, that's a conversation we had off camera on the flight to Detroit yesterday. And I pressed it, that's why I wanted an interview in the first place, because I was disquieted by his March 4th tweet. I think it's entirely possible, indeed likely, that intel agencies were surveilling people associated with the Trump campaign. But when he made that claim, I felt he had a moral obligation to back it up with evidence. And so, I pressed him on it a lot. And he said look, we have this information. I said can you tell me? No, we have to wait. And so, you know, like every citizen, no matter what side you're on politically, I'm hoping to get to the bottom of it. I think it matters. It's not enough to dismiss it as crazy. It's a real thing and I'm concern to all of us. You don't want police state stuff going on in your own country. Come on now.\n\nWILLIAMS: I agree.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: This is a hot topic. I don't know what question Kimberly has. But she is next.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUILFOYLE: How is it going, Tucker?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGUILFOYLE: A small Russian joke. So, listen, I'm curious to hear what you're going to have on the show tonight. You're going to have a little bit more of the interview. Can you give us a little tease?\n\nCARLSON: I really can't.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: It is usually 20 minutes into their first segment, and then after the commercial break I will reveal something of no public interest at all.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: That was mean, I'm sorry.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Why did you Maddow us? We're The Five, we're friendly here.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: You know what, I hate teasing shows because you feel if you can never live up to it. We are going to be talking about this subject, that's for sure.\n\nGUILFOYLE: So a little bit about the incidental collection perhaps? I find that phrase and term that Nunes used.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: They lied about it. Congress lies about it. They have always lied about it. Republicans and Democrats lie about it, patronizing the rest of us. We are United States citizens. And we have a right to know this stuff. I think we should demand it.\n\nPERINO: All right, Tucker. I have one last for you, and that is your friend, Greg Gutfeld.\n\nGUTFELD: Tucker, thanks for coming on the show. No, really, thanks. I appreciate it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGUTFELD: I enjoy your work and most of the stuff you do, I actually kind of agree with, but I have a question I would like to ask you. How do you actually keep getting guests?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: That was my impression of you. You always start with thanks for coming on the show. I really like your work. You're doing a really good job. But I have one question, why are you horrible?\n\nCARLSON: I am so lacking self-awareness.\n\nGUTFELD: That was a terrible impression.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: I like Greg's style, very thoughtful all of a sudden.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: Are you having a hard time now? Are you having a hard time now, because you've had almost every other day you have a really exciting, volatile interview, that it's harder finding people who don't know what they are getting into or they don't mind?\n\nCARLSON: Well, no. I mean, look, in exchange, we book people all the time I don't agree with, but in exchange, I hope we give them the opportunity to say what they think. There is at least some portion of the interview were I'd be quiet and they say their piece. There are a lot of viewers who watch Fox of course. And I think that's valuable. Maybe that's the idea.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: Tucker, just real quick, I asked you. How is the candy game on Air Force One these days?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCARLSON: Well, you spent years on that plane. It's ridiculous. The whole thing is sponsored by Hershey's and the Mars Corporation. It's unbelievable how much candy there is.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: Did you fill your pockets?\n\nCARLSON: Not until Easter. I didn't.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPERINO: All right. Thank you, Tucker. Don't forget, tune in at 9:00 p.m. Eastern for more of his interview with President Trump.\n\nAnd ahead, national security and defense are top priorities for President Trump. And he is going to present his first budget to Congress. Will he succeed in acting some of the less pet projects to save your hard earned tax dollars? We have details next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUILFOYLE: President Trump has unveiled his highly anticipated America First budget. The proposal calls for a big boost in military spending and a down payment on the border wall. To help pay for this, the blueprint slashes funding to other areas like the Environmental Protection Agency, National Endowment for the Arts, and foreign aid. Also, on the chopping block as the corporation for public broadcasting, which supports public stations including PBS and NPR. Some people are outraged by these cuts, but shouldn't big bird be able to survive in the real world and the free market without taxpayer dollars paying for it? I think so. I think so. All right. Big bird, little bird, do you think big bird would be able to survive in the real world?\n\nGUTFELD: It's high time. It's a priority. Military should come before Muppets. More killing, less Kermit. More bombs, less Bert and Ernie.\n\nBy the way, let's talk about Big Bird and why you should give the bird the big bird. Most overrated character in all of \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nGUILFOYLE: De Blasio or Big Bird?\n\nGUTFELD: It gets millions and millions of dollars in licensing fees, manufacturers -- like manufactured things.\n\nPERINO: Toys.\n\nGUTFELD: Toys, thank you. Only 10 percent comes from PBS affiliates. So they always keep using Big Bird as a symbol. It doesn't need government assistance. The bird is well fed.\n\nWILLIAMS: Do you mind if I interrupt?\n\nGUTFELD: No.\n\nWILLIAMS: Do you know who Big Bird works for these days?\n\nGUTFELD: HBO.\n\nWILLIAMS: HBO.\n\nGUTFELD: That's my point. Still gets 10 percent -- there's still 10 percent from PBS.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, but I'm saying, Big Bird is out there. He's walking on his own feathers.\n\nGUTFELD: I hear you. That's why I'm tired of hearing about him.\n\nWILLIAMS: All right.\n\nGUILFOYLE: OK.\n\nGUTFELD: We're agreeing.\n\nWILLIAMS: We are.\n\nGUILFOYLE: What's wrong, Bolling?\n\nBOLLING: No, no, I'm listening. This is fascinating.\n\nGUILFOYLE: A conversation. Is it Bluetooth.\n\nGUTFELD: You were the first person to hate on the Muppets.\n\nBOLLING: I did. I think they're communists. I told you that.\n\nDon't you remember when Tex Richmond was the evil corporate owner that was going to close the Muppet studio down? Tex rich man, the oil -- oil billionaire? Please.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Please.\n\nBOLLING: I have a long history with the Muppets.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.\n\nBOLLING: I don't want to get in trouble for that.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.\n\nBOLLING: He's -- President Trump and Mick Mulvaney, they're following through on a lot of the promises they made during the campaign, including shutting -- stopping the funding for -- cutting back a lot of agency funding, including foreign aid.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Foreign aid, EPA.\n\nBOLLING: That's one he told me personally. He said, \"We are going to have a massive slash in foreign aid.\" I think that's a great idea. Savings on money you give to foreign countries is spent on the military. Who should be against that? Nobody.\n\nAlso, a lot of people are up in arms about this National Endowment for the Arts being completely slashed. I believe they're down to zero, if I'm not mistaken. And I agree with it. Now, this sounds anti-culture, but I think this is the area that we've wasted so much money. I mean, think of some of the things that we, as taxpayers, we funded. \"The Immersion.\" You know, Chris in artist's urine, that one. Robert Mapplethorpe. It keeps going on and on.\n\nIf it's offensive, all the taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it. And if it can't stand on its own two feet in a free market, it shouldn't be paid for by the American taxpayer.\n\nGUTFELD: Why would you want government support from Trump if you're an artist? Shouldn't that, like, offend you, to take money from...\n\nGUILFOYLE: Good point, right? They should say, \"No thanks.\"\n\nBOLLING: Draw a line between government not censoring it? Like I don't want government to say you can't do it. I just don't want to pay for it.\n\nGUILFOYLE: All right. D.P.\n\nPERINO: Well, in Washington, when you put out a budget, the only thing that matters to the media is what is getting an increase and what is getting a decrease. And there's never a question, there's never really time for the media to have this thoughtful discussion about, does the program still work? Has it been eclipsed by technology? Could it be done better by the states?\n\nI mean, I think that Mick Mulvaney had a lot of good explanations today. Like, very levelheaded and smart.\n\nBut say on the foreign aid budget, foreign aid is less than 1 percent of our entire budget. OK? And actually, there's diplomatic reasons that you have foreign aid in order to help in certain places. That doesn't mean all programs are good.\n\nBut I think what we're missing here is a discussion about the real problem with the budget. If it's a pie chart, the entitlement spending continues to take up more and more and more of it; and if we don't deal with that in some sort of reasonable, modest way, these debates are going to get even tougher about other programs that you might like that you're going to have to cut, because we're not actually dealing with that issue.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes, and they've actually gotten quite a lot done here, Juan, in short order.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, I mean, the big disappointment to me, if we're talking about, you know, big cuts, is the deficit. I thought this was all about eliminating deficit. Turns out Mick Mulvaney says, \"No, we're not doing any of that.\" There's nothing like that in this budget. So what are they going after?\n\nWell, for me, sitting here, I'm thinking, \"Oh, really? You want to go after seniors who are trying to get a new job?\" That's what they want to do away with. How about the people who live in Appalachia, who live in the Delta region? Do away with economic development down there. How about people who just want to get a lawyer, because they're up against something that they don't understand? No more legal services. I just -- you know, chemical safety. How about homelessness? Which I don't know; I'm walking around New York City. I think, boy, homelessness is worse these days.\n\nGUTFELD: You know under de Blasio.\n\nGUILFOYLE: The original Big Bird.\n\nWILLIAMS: OK, but I'm saying here, they do away with all efforts...\n\nGUILFOYLE: Good thing he's not getting excited.\n\nWILLIAMS: ... to look at homeless. So I'm just thinking to myself, well, give me a rationale for what you're doing.\n\nPERINO: Right.\n\nWILLIAMS: Don't just go slashing. Like, think it through with me. Give me a chance to support you, President Trump.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Well, that was an impassioned plea.\n\nGUTFELD: Why do you think homelessness is so bad in New York under a liberal mayor? That's what I don't understand.\n\nWILLIAMS: I think...\n\nGUTFELD: You're supposed to be really good at this.\n\nGUILFOYLE: And homicides.\n\nWILLIAMS: ... in San Francisco, you go to San Francisco, you go to Salt Lake City. I don't care who the mayor is. Some cities are just -- they just attract homeless people.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness.\n\nOr bad mayors.\n\nOK, ahead, one of Snoop Dogg's rap pals is backing up his despicable video depicting a mock assassination of President Trump. Bow Wow is taking it even further by making threats now against the first lady. That disgusting story next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nGUTFELD: In obscure loser news: Bow Wow is back.\n\nBow Wow, previously known as Lil' Bow Wow, previously known as washed-up rapper, previously known as washed-up actor, currently known as dumb and desperate, came to Snoop Dogg's defense after Mr. Trump tweeted about Snoop's video in which he mock-shoots the president. Bow Wow, also known as Shad Moss, also known as Tiny Shaft, also known as Sad Little Bitch.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.\n\nGUTFELD: He is a dog, mind you. Tried to make a bigger name for himself by tweeting this. \"Ayo, @RealDonaldTrump, shut your punk ass up, talking bleep about my uncle Snoop Dogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us.\"\n\nSo Lil Weenie just threatened the first lady with sexual enslavement. I'd say that's a crime and punishable by jail time, but given the career of Little Shad -- aka Kneepad Shad -- that would be a step up.\n\nGUILFOYLE: What?\n\nGUTFELD: It's got to be hard 20 years on to change nothing but your name.\n\nMeanwhile, don't hold your breath for any feminist or media outrage. It's not like he threatened Michelle Obama. Different rules apply. See, since Trump once said sexist stuff, Melania is open game. That's the argument from some feminists who are looking for any excuse to smear the woman. What cowards they are.\n\nOh, well, the washed-up rapper has since deleted the tweet. I guess that makes Bow Wow a big meow-meow.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh.\n\nBOLLING: Well done.\n\nGUTFELD: Thank you.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes, that was pretty...\n\nWILLIAMS: Good takedown.\n\nGUILFOYLE: We'll be right back.\n\nGUTFELD: We'll be right back after this.\n\nGUILFOYLE: You just destroyed whatever little bit of dignity he had left.\n\nGUTFELD: He is a big meow-meow.\n\nGUILFOYLE: I like the kneepad thing.\n\nGUTFELD: He won't.\n\nBOLLING: Melania is a victim in this, and no one's even looking at it. You listen to this and those on the left are probably saying, \"Oh, Trump,\" as you point out, \"Trump has said some stuff.\" So they look at -- they frame it only in that respect. Not Melania. She's an innocent victim in this. That's terrible.\n\nGUTFELD: And they would find something else to excuse this.\n\nBOLLING: How about Barron?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nBOLLING: A 10-year-old who's -- they're talking like that about his mother.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, yes. But Dana, this applies to all conservative Republican women, correct? They will find one reason...\n\nPERINO: Well, really not to that extent. But yes, I do think that the feminists pick and choose who they decide to defend.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nPERINO: And you don't see the outcry. It actually would behoove them to do it, because I actually think that Melania Trump is one of the most interesting people of the administration. And I think that her platform, once she decides on what it will be -- I mean, she already -- you saw in the video that you showed, you know, she's very interested in children being able to read, and she was reading at -- one of the Dr. Seuss books.\n\nSo there's the literacy piece. There's a lot of different things that she's going to be able to do to bring attention to that the feminists will probably agree with.\n\nGUTFELD: Right.\n\nPERINO: And so why not take a chance to defend her, as they would any other woman? Just because she's Donald Trump's wife doesn't mean this is acceptable.\n\nGUTFELD: Because it's personal\n\nBOLLING: Can we just say -- and you could do it; it's your monologue -- but he owes her, like, a public apology.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nBOLLING: Not just a Twitter, \"I take it back.\"\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, no.\n\nPERINO: Absolutely.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. What do you think -- what should the Secret Service do, Kimberly? It's an actual threat. I mean...\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes.\n\nGUTFELD: ... pimping her out?\n\nGUILFOYLE: Kill them.\n\nGUTFELD: Killing them.\n\nGUILFOYLE: I think it would be fantastic if Snoop and wannabe Snoop got a visit from, like, the federal marshals. And let's see how tough and gangster they are then.\n\nHonestly, this is horrible behavior. You're a hundred percent right. You nailed it. What a double standard. This would never fly. There would be outrage all over the place of somebody said this, you know, God forbid, about Michelle Obama. To me, it's so offensive. Like, what did Melania Trump ever do to any of these people?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, except she's married to Donald Trump.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Basically, they're going to make her, like, a prostitute? I mean, like, the whole thing is so...\n\nPERINO: That they would say that about any woman is disgusting.\n\nGUILFOYLE: That's my point. About anybody.\n\nPERINO: Yes.\n\nGUILFOYLE: So, you know, they're -- that's the worst. I mean, both of them.\n\nGUTFELD: My theory, Juan, is that...\n\nGUILFOYLE: Must run in their family.\n\nGUTFELD: ... Bow Wow's career is over in human and dog years. So this is, like, his way of trying to be relevant.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, you are educating me. I didn't know about the various -- the evolution or devolution.\n\nGUTFELD: I just made up those names.\n\nWILLIAMS: Oh, you did?\n\nGUTFELD: He went from L'il Bow Wow to Bow Wow to Shad whatever his name. You know, this guy is so desperate, he advertises his birthday party on Twitter, because I don't think he can get guests.\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, see, I think...\n\nGUILFOYLE: You've been following him a lot, haven't you?\n\nWILLIAMS: By the way, I think there were lots of insulting things said about Michelle Obama, and I hope that we agree on that, that this is unacceptable.\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, but not by...\n\nPERINO: But there was outrage.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\n\nPERINO: There was collective -- for Melania Trump, it's hardly been defended by any feminist group.\n\nWILLIAMS: No, no, no. I don't know about the feminist groups and I don't know if the feminists were the ones who were defending Michelle Obama. But I'll tell you, a lot of people were offended by the kind of racial animus...\n\nPERINO: Of course.\n\nWILLIAMS: ... directed at her, and I think it's reasonable to say...\n\nBOLLING: By celebrities?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, I don't remember any celebrities.\n\nWILLIAMS: I remember it online. That's for sure.\n\nPERINO: But not by celebrities.\n\nBOLLING: This is a celebrity. He's a rapper that kids look up to and say, \"Oh, I want to be like him.\"\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think a lot of these Republican politicians, some of them, especially some of the locals, said horrible things. But I don't -- but that's not the point. It's not, like, \"I'm going to weigh this injustice or this wrong against that wrong.\" I think it's wrong. And I don't think it's acceptable.\n\nAnd I think the big wrong in my book was the Snoop Dogg thing, which had a phony gun with a pop thing coming out...\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nWILLIAMS: ... directed at the president. To me, that just breaks down the society. I don't think there's any place for it.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Good job, Juan.\n\nGUTFELD: All right. Up next, a Hamburglar -- I haven't heard that word in a while -- hacks McDonald's and attacks one of its fans, President Trump. More on that when we return.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't know how you do it. I've put together some really impressive deals. But this thing you've pulled off, it's amazing. A Big and Tasty for just a dollar? How do you do it? What's your secret?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS: President Trump is one of McDonald's most loyal customers. I never knew that he made that ad.\n\nBut for a brief moment this morning, the fast food giant wasn't loving him. A lot of people were surprised to see this tweet pinned to the top of the eatery's official Twitter account this morning. It read, \"Donald Trump, you are actually a disgusting excuse of a president, and we would love to have Barack Obama back. Also, you have tiny hands,\" end quote.\n\nThe surprising message quickly deleted. McDonald's says its account was compromised, and they are investigating.\n\nKimberly, what do you make of this?\n\nGUILFOYLE: I love McDonald's.\n\nWILLIAMS: But Kimberly, Kimberly, we're talking about this tweet.\n\nGUILFOYLE: \"Kimberly's Food Court.\"\n\nWILLIAMS: It was fake news, Kimberly.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Listen, I mean, the problem is, obviously, anything that Donald Trump likes or does, people are going to hate against it and try and manipulate it and put it down. And you know what? It's like McDonald's should be psyched that he, in fact, loves their food and gives them advertising. Because at least half the country will go for it. Maybe the people that don't like Donald Trump will go for Burger King or Wendy's.\n\nWILLIAMS: Are you going to do \"Kimberly's Food Court\" on McDonald's today?\n\nGUILFOYLE: Well, if I had -- I should have, actually, but since it was this segment, it didn't -- that didn't allow me.\n\nWILLIAMS: Didn't allow you.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes. It would've been redundant.\n\nWILLIAMS: Now you're -- you stay in shape, Eric Bolling.\n\nGUILFOYLE: He eats French fries.\n\nWILLIAMS: But I noticed -- well, yes. But he stays in shape. I mean, he makes...\n\nGUTFELD: They use vegetable oil.\n\nWILLIAMS: You know, I think you don't eat meat. Right?\n\nBOLLING: I don't eat meat. I don't eat red meat.\n\nWILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying. What do you think of his diet?\n\nGUTFELD: Don't eat McDonald's.\n\nBOLLING: I eat turkey, fish, and...\n\nWILLIAMS: OK, OK. But in all honesty, the president's diet is not the best.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. Is that what this segment is really going to become about?\n\nBOLLING: In fact, remember, when he was a campaigner, he had that big interview, and they were talking about his diet and his weight and everything. He produced that information on his -- you know, he needs to lose, like, 20 pounds.\n\nWILLIAMS: OK.\n\nBOLLING: He'll tell you; he'll be the first one to tell you that. But maybe with the White House, Dana can tell us. Aren't there like 35 chefs in the White House? You can anything you want made at any time.\n\nPERINO: I don't know how many there are but, yes, the president can get what he wants. But the president pays for his own food.\n\nWILLIAMS: Really? What do you mean by that?\n\nPERINO: Like, you pay for your own food in the White House.\n\nWILLIAMS: What?\n\nPERINO: As president. Yes.\n\nWILLIAMS: I've never heard of this. The president pays for his dinner.\n\nPERINO: Yes, that was one of the things that President Obama complained about in one of his exit interviews was that he actually pays for his own food and everyone thought he was living high on the hog. But you do. Like, if you have a dinner party or something.\n\nWILLIAMS: Oh, if you have a dinner party.\n\nPERINO: Yes, for your family.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, yes, but the chef prepares dinner every night.\n\nPERINO: Yes, but you actually pay for the food.\n\nWILLIAMS: No, for that -- for every night dinner?\n\nPERINO: I think so, yes.\n\nWILLIAMS: I don't think so, but I could be wrong.\n\nGUILFOYLE: I think we should stay at the president's.\n\nGUTFELD: I would just eat out every night.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, really.\n\nGUTFELD: Why am I paying for this?\n\nPERINO: Can I say this about the actual topic?\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\n\nPERINO: When I first saw the tweet, my first -- my initial thought was that McDonald's has been hacked. It looks like that is what happened.\n\nMy second thought was that former press secretary Robert Gibbs, who's now the communications person at McDonald's, is going to have a really crappy day.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Did you write him? You should have.\n\nPERINO: No. But hi, if you're watching.\n\nWILLIAMS: By the way, who was that purple guy in the ad?\n\nGUILFOYLE: Grimace?\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, Grimace.\n\nWILLIAMS: Grimace. Did you know he'd made that ad? I never saw that ad.\n\nGUTFELD: I think it's artificial intelligence. You know, they're automating everything at McDonald's. And I think the robots at McDonald's that are making the burgers are going, like, \"I think Trump is going to try to slow automation,\" and so this -- they're testing the water; they're flexing their robotic muscles. This was the first step: artificial intelligence going after Donald Trump. You'd better be careful.\n\nWILLIAMS: You know what? He should go to Chick-Fil-A. They're pretty good. Pretty good.\n\nGUILFOYLE: You know, they used to make shamrock -- Shamrock Shakes at McDonald's.\n\nGUTFELD: Those were fantastic.\n\nGUILFOYLE: They create a situation for you, Greg.\n\nGUTFELD: Not good for the...\n\nGUILFOYLE: Later.\n\nGUTFELD: Later.\n\nWILLIAMS: Enough, enough. This -- this happy meal is done. \"One More Thing\" up next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBOLLING: It's time for \"One More Thing.\" I'm going to kick it off. Today starts, I believe, the greatest sporting event of the whole year. I love NCAA March Madness.\n\nPresident Obama kept with tradition, and he picked his Final Four brackets. He didn't go very far out on a limb. He took for the Final Four Duke, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina. And he has North Carolina over Duke in the championship game.\n\nI will go a little bit more aggressive. I'll go with Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas, and North Carolina. And I'll have Gonzaga win the whole thing. Just taking a shot.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Are you, like, kind of playing against President Obama but he doesn't know?\n\nBOLLING: Yes, a little bit like that.\n\nPERINO: I love it that President Trump isn't doing a bracket.\n\nBOLLING: You didn't like it?\n\nPERINO: I love that.\n\nBOLLING: Why?\n\nPERINO: Because I thought it was annoying. You've got better things to do as the president.\n\nWILLIAMS: Oh, I see. Play golf, play golf.\n\nAnd by the way, Villanova.\n\nBOLLING: Nova is a good -- great team. Great team.\n\nGUILFOYLE: They're favored to win.\n\nBOLLING: Your turn.\n\nPERINO: OK, so Susan Mortime (ph) and a lot of people here at FOX News have helped put together a package that is going to run tomorrow, and we have a little tease. This is about my trip to Mercy Ships in Africa just a couple days ago. Here we go.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPERINO: So children are ticklish everywhere.\n\n(voice-over): This is Mercy's Hope Center. It's where patients well enough to leave the ship go to fully recover and where some pre-op patients are sent to prepare.\n\nPerhaps the most touching moment of my trip was the celebration for three women who just had their fistulas successfully repaired. There weren't many dry eyes in the room, full of song, dance and prayer.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUILFOYLE: My gosh.\n\nPERINO: So we'll have the full package tomorrow, and I also just posted on FOXNews.com. It's a rather lengthy essay. But I think you might find it worthwhile. So you can find it there and on our Facebook page.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Very nice.\n\nBOLLING: K.G., you're up.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Great trip. We're looking forward to that tomorrow.\n\nPERINO: Thanks.\n\nGUILFOYLE: OK, so in a little bit of Broadway news, international friends is such a nice thing, isn't it? So Ivanka Trump and Justin Trudeau went to Broadway together. She took -- he took her as his guest for the Broadway show \"Come from Away.\" And you know, he's the Canadian prime minister, and what's interesting about this is it's a new musical. It opened on March 12, and it celebrates Canada's compassion for international travelers stranded in the country after the September 11 terrorist attack. Also, Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., was in attendance, as well. So that was very nice. Yes.\n\nBOLLING: It's a great story. Yes, it was good.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Check it out.\n\nBOLLING: Amazing.\n\nGUTFELD: He got beaten up by Matthew Perry.\n\nPERINO: Oh, I saw that today.\n\nGUTFELD: Anyway.\n\nBOLLING: Different story. Justin Trudeau did?\n\nPERINO: Year ago.\n\nGUTFELD: They both went to the same high school or something.\n\nBOLLING: Oh.\n\nGUTFELD: It wasn't recently, Juan.\n\nWILLIAMS: I was thinking, what is going on on Broadway?\n\nGUTFELD: It was before \"Friends.\"\n\nGUILFOYLE: Jumped on Broadway? Gosh, de Blasio is ruining this city.\n\nWILLIAMS: Snow in the east this week, you know that. But look at this video.\n\nGUTFELD: This is amazing.\n\nPERINO: I would have been so upset.\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, so that's the Amtrak coming into Rhinecliff, New York, on yesterday morning. And as you can see, the commuters weren't ready. They should have gotten out of the way.\n\nPERINO: Oh, my gosh.\n\nWILLIAMS: Because they got snowed big-time. Unbelievable. Boom! Look at that.\n\nPERINO: Did anybody get hurt?\n\nWILLIAMS: No. No one got hurt, Dana.\n\nGUILFOYLE: They're lucky somebody didn't fall the wrong way.\n\nWILLIAMS: From what I'm told, some people had some headaches but nobody got smooshed. You know?\n\nBOLLING: All right. Gregory, you're up.\n\nGUTFELD: On a related note...\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: I hate these people!\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGUTFELD: First, I want to apologize, because this only affects a certain number of people in America, and I hate doing New York-centric stories. But I hate Mayor de Blasio.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes.\n\nGUTFELD: And I hate him more now than possibly. I hate the way he deals with the homeless problem.\n\nGUILFOYLE: The worst.\n\nGUTFELD: I hate the way he deals with traffic. I hate everything. But today we almost didn't have Kimberly on the show.\n\nGUILFOYLE: Yes, look at the snow. I couldn't even get out and wrap up my shoes.\n\nGUTFELD: Couldn't get to work. This guy doesn't know how to clear a street. I -- again, I apologize.\n\nGUILFOYLE: You can take the subway.\n\nGUTFELD: It only matters to the people on the East Coast that we have such a horrible mayor. But I just want to remind everybody; he's a horrible mayor.\n\nBOLLING: Can I -- I swear to God, this was almost going to be my \"One More Thing\" today. I had to walk one -- over a mile to work...\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\nBOLLING: ... from the Upper West Side, because streets weren't plowed.\n\nWILLIAMS: You can't jaywalk. That is the problem.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGUTFELD: Always breaking the law.\n\nBOLLING: So you know the drill. \"Special Report\" next.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
