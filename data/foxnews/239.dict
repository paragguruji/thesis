The lawsuit characterizes the ban as a first step in fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to impose \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" until the government \"can figure out what is going on.\"\n\nTrump's order suspends immigration for citizens of the seven countries for 90 days. Trump has said the action is being falsely characterized as a \"Muslim ban.\"\n\nA judge at the Alexandria courthouse already had issued a restraining order against the administration in response to a similar lawsuit filed over the weekend.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
