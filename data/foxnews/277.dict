Washington state, Minnesota and other states say the appeals court should allow the temporary restraining order to stand as their lawsuit moves through the legal system.\n\nThe government is asking the court to restore Trump's executive order, contending that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nMaryland is suing over President Donald Trump's travel ban, joining a series of states and groups.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Maryland and National Immigration Law Center filed the lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Maryland.\n\nThe groups argue that the executive order violates federal laws and the Constitution, saying it was \"substantially motivated\" by an intent to discriminate against Muslims. Plaintiffs include U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from countries named by the ban.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as a panel of judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals prepared to hear a case on the travel ban, which temporarily suspends the country's refugee program and immigration from seven countries with terrorism concerns.\n\nThe Justice Department says the order was a \"lawful exercise\" of the president's authority.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nCivil rights groups have asked a New York judge to force the government to name anyone detained or rejected from U.S. entry after President Donald Trump signed the travel and refugee ban.\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups also asked the federal judge to require the government to return to the United States anyone who was removed because of Trump's order.\n\nThe request comes 10 days after a Brooklyn, New York, judge stopped the government from deporting people from nations subject to the travel ban.\n\nThe Justice Department has defended the executive order as a matter of national security. It has said Trump's order affecting seven predominantly Muslim countries was within his authority.\n\n___\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nA spokesman for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says it's unlikely the court will issue a ruling Tuesday in a lawsuit over President Donald Trump's travel and refugee ban.\n\nSpokesman David Madden said a ruling is likely later this week.\n\nHe said the proceedings in San Francisco later Tuesday could last longer than 60 minutes depending on questioning by the judges. Each side has been granted 30 minutes of argument in the hearing, which will be held by telephone.\n\nWashington state and Minnesota sued Trump last week, saying the ban harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination.\n\nThe Justice Department says the issue is a matter of national security, and Trump's executive order affecting seven predominantly Muslim countries was well within his authority.\n\nThe appellate court this weekend denied the Trump administration's request to immediately set aside a Seattle judge's ruling that put a hold on the ban nationwide.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
