Syrians are indefinitely blocked from entry.\n\nSome governments including U.S. allies have criticized the policy, which caused chaos at U.S. airports on the weekend as travelers were detained and sparked protests.\n\nThe Indonesian government has advised its citizens in the United States to be familiar with their rights and respect local laws. It said its missions are monitoring any developments that could affect Indonesians in the U.S.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
