The ban temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.\n\nJustice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\n\nThe states said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.\n\nBoth sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments Tuesday conducted by phone \u2014 an unusual step \u2014 and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media. It attracted a huge audience.\n\nThe judges hammered away at the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but they also challenged the states' argument that it targeted Muslims.\n\n\"I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,\" Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota.\n\nOnly 15 percent of the world's Muslims are affected by the executive order, the judge said, citing his own calculations.\n\n\"Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism?\" Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked the Justice Department attorney.\n\nThe lower-court judge temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base. Robart put the executive order on hold while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.\n\nAfter that ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a vacancy, and there's no chance Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, will be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban.\n\nThe ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue. The administration also could change the executive order, including changing its scope or duration.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "type": "article"}
