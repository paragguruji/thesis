Bush appointee, said his job is simply to determine whether the order \"falls within the bounds of the President's statutory authority or whether the President has exercised that authority in violation of constitutional restraints.\"\n\nAt this stage of the lawsuit, Trenga concluded, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood to succeed on the merits.\n\nA lawyer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the Virginia case on behalf of multiple clients, said he will appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. That court is already scheduled to hear the government's appeal from the Maryland case on May 8.\n\nTrenga wrote that the current executive order is substantially different from the first travel ban sought by the Trump administration, which also was blocked by multiple judges before it was rescinded in favor of the current order.\n\nThis revised order no longer carves out an exception favoring Christians and other religious minorities from Muslim-majority nations included in the ban. It also spells out the administration's justification for the ban and does not seek cancellation of existing visas, as the original order did.\n\nThe council's lawyers described it as just a gussied-up version of the \"Muslim ban\" Trump proposed during his campaign. They urged the judge to look beyond the text and consider its intent in the context of Trump's public statements, which they say reveal an anti-Muslim bias.\n\nTrenga wrote that the president's past rhetoric has become less significant given the significant changes between the first and second executive orders.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a statement praising the ruling. \"As the Court correctly explains, the President's Executive Order falls well within his authority to safeguard the nation's security,\" spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said.\n\nGadeir Abbas, the lawyer for the council, said he is thankful the ruling does not affect the nationwide injunctions imposed by the Hawaii and Maryland judges.\n\n\"We look forward to the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court weighing in on this matter, as those are the bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution will protect the rights of Muslim Americans,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "type": "article"}
