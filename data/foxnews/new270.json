The long list of enterprises looking to join the fight against Trump are among the country's biggest, most high-profile businesses like Uber, eBay and Netflix.\n\nThe businesses are looking to help Washington and Minnesota as they sue Trump. The states have said the ban harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this weekend denied the administration's request to immediately set aside a Seattle judge's ruling that put a hold on the ban nationwide.\n\nTrump's order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 countries the administration said raise terrorism concerns.
