That was true during the campaign and it remains true today. Just ask him: He said yesterday he wouldn\u2019t have gotten elected without it (as he put it, \u201cZERO chance of winning WH\u201d if he had \u201crelied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes\u201d).\n\nMuch of the media has always found it unseemly\u2014now the preferred word is \u201cunpresidential\u201d\u2014that Trump riffs on social media and strafes various targets, including of course the press.\n\nBut in recent days, the president sometimes seems to be hurting his own cause. The New York Times said in a front-page story that Trump \u201cmay have irretrievably undermined his lawyers\u2019 efforts to persuade the Supreme Court\u201d to uphold his travel ban. The Washington Post said in a front-page story that \u201cthe president\u2019s tweets could significantly damage his administration\u2019s effort to restore the ban.\u201d\n\nThe stories are referring to such tweets as this one: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\u201d\n\nThat was rather odd since Trump is ultimately in charge of the DOJ. The department could not have proposed a second travel ban, to replace the one blocked by the courts, without the president\u2019s approval. (And yes, he is now calling the temporary travel restrictions a ban.)\n\nOne of the voices is George Conway, who recently withdrew from consideration to run Justice\u2019s Civil Division. The lawyer, who is married to Kellyanne Conway, wrote that \u201cthese tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help\u201d the solicitor general get five votes in the Supreme Court, \u201cwhich is actually what matters. Sad.\u201d\n\nConway stuck by his position in subsequent tweets but made clear that he supports the president.\n\nTrump invoked the ban last weekend in his first tweet after the terror attack at London Bridge:\n\n\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nHe also went off on London\u2019s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan:\n\n\u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d Khan had actually said the city was increasing its police presence in the coming days and there was no reason for residents to be alarmed about their future safety.\n\nThis prompted another wave of criticism that the president was picking a fight with London\u2019s mayor rather than delivering a unifying message after the attack.\n\nTrump contends that the \u201cfake\u201d mainstream media are \u201cworking so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media.\u201d Well, no one thinks he\u2019s going to stop. But if his tweets stir things up, or complicate a pending legal case, then that is going to draw widespread coverage. These are, after all, not leaks or chatter, but statements directly from the president.\n\nAnd the week is only halfway over. When James Comey testifies on the Hill tomorrow\u2014which will be such a huge media event that ABC, CBS and NBC are carrying it live\u2014Trump may not be a bystander.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Robert Costa says\u2014on Twitter, of course\u2014that two White House sources tell him Trump \u201cdoes not plan to put down Twitter on Thursday. May live tweet if he feels the need to respond.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bet against that happening.\n\n\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m.).
