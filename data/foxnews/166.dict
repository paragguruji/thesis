The 9th Circuit, considered among the most liberal circuits in the country, did side with the administration Monday in allowing the government to review vetting procedures. The judges directed a lower court to re-issue its preliminary injunction following the new guidance.\n\nThe 9th Circuit opinion represents just one development in the fast-moving legal battle.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia also ruled against the travel ban May 25. The administration has appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier Monday, lawyers for Hawaii also told the Supreme Court that letting the Trump administration enforce the ban would \"thrust the country back into the chaos and confusion\" that resulted when the policy was first announced in January.\n\nThe state urged the justices to deny the administration plea to reinstate the policy after lower courts blocked it. The high court is considering the administration's request and could act before the justices wind up their work at the end of June.\n\nUnder the Trump policy, immigration officials would have 90 days to decide what changes are necessary before people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may resume applying for visas. The U.S. refugee program would be halted for 120 days.\n\nIt would take a majority of the Supreme Court, at least five justices, to put the policy into effect.\n\nThe 9th Circuit weighed in Monday after a federal judge in Hawaii already blocked the ban.\n\nTrump signed his first executive order on travel a week after he took office in January. It applied to travelers from the six countries as well as Iraq and took effect immediately, leading to commotion at U.S. airports as the Homeland Security Department scrambled to figure out who the order covered and how it was to be implemented.\n\nA federal judge blocked it eight days later.\n\nIn March, Trump issued a narrower order, but federal courts that have examined it so far have blocked it as well.\n\nOn Twitter last week, Trump said the \"courts are slow and political\" and he said the government already is \"EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "type": "article"}
