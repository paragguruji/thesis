But if we peel those numbers back just a bit, we see more than just an unpopular president pushing an unpopular initiative.\n\nAlmost half of the people who support the wall would also back Trump\u2019s call for a government shutdown unless Congress provides adequate funds to start construction in earnest.\n\nThink about that. That\u2019s nearly one in five American voters who would rather the government go off the fiscal cliff at the end of next month than not start construction on Trump\u2019s great wall.\n\nThese are quite likely the same voters who have stood by Trump through all of the tempests, both genuine and manufactured, that have beset him since he declared for office last summer. They may love the smackdown showmanship and the other parts of Trump\u2019s personality-driven presidency, but it\u2019s the wall that represents his first, most important contract with them.\n\nJust as it was an, ahem, concrete version of Trump\u2019s MAGA message for these voters, it remains the concrete proof that, despite all of the missteps, Trump is still delivering. They didn\u2019t chant \u201cDrop corporate taxes!\u201d at the rallies.\n\nDemocrats are, of course, thrilled. This gives them the possibility of either a) running against a party next year that shut the government on itself or b) running against vulnerable Republicans with ads that say \u201cCongresswoman Susie Creamcheese voted to take money away from drowning puppies to fund Donald Trump\u2019s border wall\u2026\u201d\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s 2016 victory demonstrated perfectly, the power of an intensely engaged minority is enormous in our political era.\n\nTrump looks unlikely to ever be a popular politician in the sense of some of his predecessors. He is the most divisive national political figure in memory and the antipathy against him among nearly half the electorate seems fairly well set.\n\nMoreover, he will certainly have significant primary opposition in his own party. The fact that his own vice president is significantly more popular than Trump \u2013 not just in general but among Republicans \u2013 is a good refection of the discontentment among conservatives.\n\nFor Trump to survive the primaries and stand a fighting chance in the fall of 2020 he will need his noisy minority not just with him, but ready to fight again. And if the builder they elected doesn\u2019t build a wall, they won\u2019t be ready to rumble.\n\nTrump seems to understand that enough to have made the shutdown treat over the wall. But that puts him at odds with many, if not most, of his fellow Republicans in Congress. Once again, Trump and his party\u2019s interests diverge.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why there\u2019s a real chance of a shutdown, a shutdown, by the way, that would jeopardize other GOP priorities like tax cuts and patching ObamaCare for next year.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: BESTIES\n\n\u201cCommercial republics, like ours, will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 6\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: REVOLUTIONARY ROGUE\n\nHistory: \u201cSamuel Mason, a Patriot captain in command of Fort Henry on the Ohio frontier [in present-day Wheeling, W.Va.], survives a devastating Indian attack on this day in 1777. ... They ambushed the party, killing all but Mason. \u2026 Following the end of the war, though, he fell on hard times. \u2026 By the early 1800s, Mason had become one of the most notorious desperados on the American frontier, a precursor to Jesse James\u2026 Determined to apprehend Mason, the Americans upped the reward for his capture, dead or alive. The reward money soon proved too tempting for two members of Mason\u2019s gang; in July 1803 they killed Mason, cut off his head and brought it into the Mississippi territorial offices to prove that they had earned the reward. The men were soon identified as members of Mason\u2019s gang, however, and they were arrested and hanged.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\n\nyour tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump net job-approval rating: -18.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: up 0.2 points\n\n[President Trump\u2019s score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]\n\nI\u2019LL TELL YOU WHAT: \u2018BIG D\u2019 PHONES IT IN\n\nThis week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the historic devastation in Texas, Trump\u2019s new tax plan and another North Korean missile.

Trump railed against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during his campaign, slamming it as illegal \u2018amnesty.\u2019 But he changed his tune after the election, calling DACA one of the most difficult issues he\u2019s grappled with. The program has given nearly 800,000 people a reprieve from deportations. It has also provided the ability to work legally in the U.S. in the form of two-year, renewable work permits \u2014 permits the Trump administration has continued to grant as the president has mulled the issue. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said DACA was still the subject of \u2018a very lengthy review\u2019 process. \u2018It\u2019s something that\u2019s still being discussed and a final decision hasn\u2019t been made,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\nHe could face major backlash from staff, CEOs if he ends it - Axios: \u201cPresident Trump could trigger a furious response from corporations and some members of his own staff if he green-lights a plan under consideration at the White House to end DACA\u2026some top CEOs, including leaders in tech and retail, plan to be tough and vocal if Trump ends the policy. But they're keeping quiet for now because they fear antagonizing him on a question that could have massive implications for their workforces. \u2026 Trump has faced an escalating revolt from CEOs \u2014 starting with the Muslim ban, increasing with his climate-change decision, and peaking with his handling of Charlottesville. Scores of high profile CEOs would pummel him publicly if he clears the way for mass deportation of kids.\u201d\n\n\n\nHouse GOP looks at disaster funds to finance wall - AP:\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump is promising billions to help Texas rebuild from Harvey-caused epic flooding, but his Republican allies in the House are looking at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance the president\u2019s border wall. The pending reduction to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s disaster relief account is part of a massive spending bill that the House is scheduled to consider next week when lawmakers return from their August recess. The $876 million cut, which is included in the 1,305-page measure\u2019s homeland security section, pays for roughly half the cost of Trump\u2019s down payment on the U.S.-Mexico border wall that the president repeatedly promised Mexico would finance. \u2026 There\u2019s only $2.3 billion remaining in federal disaster coffers. The disaster relief cut was proposed well before Harvey and the politically bad optics are sure to lead lawmakers to do an about face, though that would create a money crunch in homeland security accounts.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Federal judge blocked Texas sanctuary city ban - Politico: \u201cA federal judge in Texas blocked the bulk of the state\u2019s immigration law targeting sanctuary cities on Wednesday, a victory for civil rights groups and Democratic-led city governments that oppose the measure. The order came two days before a Sept. 1 deadline to implement the new law, which seeks to ensure local police cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. U.S. District Court Judge Orlando Garcia issued a preliminary injunction against most provisions of the measure, known as SB 4. The law authorizes local police to ask about immigration status during routine stops, and threatens police chiefs with misdemeanor charges and fines if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws.\u201d\n\nMUELLER TEAM MET WITH RUSSIAN LOBBYIST\n\nAP: \u201cA grand jury used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has heard secret testimony from a Russian-American lobbyist who attended a June 2016 meeting with President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, The Associated Press has learned. A person familiar with the matter confirmed to the AP that Rinat Akhmetshin had appeared before Mueller\u2019s grand jury in recent weeks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the secret proceedings. The revelation is the clearest indication yet that Mueller and his team of investigators view the meeting, which came weeks after Trump had secured the Republican presidential nomination, as a relevant inquiry point in their broader probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The meeting included Donald Trump Jr.; the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Emails released by Trump Jr. show he took the meeting expecting that he would be receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nMueller working with New York A.G. to investigate Manafort - Politico: \u201cSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, according to several people familiar with the matter. The cooperation is the latest indication that the federal probe into President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is intensifying. It also could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes.\u201d\n\nTrump offered Grassley ethanol subsidy promise ahead of hearing - WaPo: \u201cPresident Trump called the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee to talk about one of his most important parochial issues \u2014 ethanol \u2014 shortly before the committee is slated to interview his son in its ongoing Russia probe. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley\u2019s panel will be hosting Trump\u2019s son next month for an interview behind closed doors in its ongoing Russia probe\u2026 On Wednesday morning, Grassley announced via Twitter that the president had called him to discuss not Russia, but ethanol, proudly announcing that \u2018he assured me he\u2019s pro ethanol\u2019 and that Grassley was free to tell the people of Iowa \u2018he\u2019s standing by his campaign PROMISE.\u2019\u201d\n\nBIDEN TO TEST THE 2020 WATERS WITH A NEW BOOK\n\nThe Hill: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden will release a new book this fall that could also serve as a test for whether the country is interested in seeing him run for president. Longtime advisers to Biden see his memoir, \u2018Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,\u2019 as the ultimate test for whether he\u2019ll wade into a potentially crowded 2020 field. \u2018It's a chance to step out on his own terms with a character reinforcing narrative that reintroduces himself to America as more than a vice president,\u2019 said one former senior aide. His book tour will be a vital test. Can he generate enthusiasm and crowds and subtly market his character, conviction, values and vision to a national audience? \u2018It's a great soft launch for a potential campaign,\u2019 the confidant said. Biden\u2019s book is due to be published on Nov. 14, just more than a year after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHarris, Sanders make new tag team - Politico: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s junior senator, Kamala Harris, on Wednesday departed from the position held by the state\u2019s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, and announced her intention to co-sponsor Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 bill. To the delight of a hometown crowd at a packed town hall meeting Wednesday in Oakland \u2014 where she was raised \u2014 Harris announced for the first time that she intended to co-sponsor \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 the single-payer health care bill which has the strong support of progressives and groups including National Nurses United, saying it was \u2018the right thing to do.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nPentagon announces Afghanistan troop number at approximately 11,000 - Politico\n\nRepublicans postpone internet regulations hearing - Axios\n\nAUDIBLE: THAT\u2019S ALMOST A COMPLIMENT!\n\n\u201cThe question is whether he can learn and change. If so, I believe he can be a good president.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said during a town hall Tuesday evening.\n\n\n\nTHE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: HARD POWER\n\nFox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano looks at the restoration of the federal government providing military hardware to local police: \u201cMoreover, the strings attached to this federal hardware giveaway do not require congressional or even local government approval. They require only acceptance by the police and regular local use of the military equipment.\u201d More here.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\u201cSir, One factor you seem to have overlooked in the defeat of Bush 1 and Clinton losing Congress was their actions on gun control. Bush 1 ran on a strict promise there would be no new gun laws during his administration, and then imposed the first \u2018assault weapons ban\u2019 by executive order. We won\u2019t get into his theatrics with the investigation into ATF actions. A lot of us who worked for his election washed our hands of him after he proved to be a spineless liar. As for Clinton, his \u2018Crime Bill\u2019 ended the careers of a lot of very senior \u2018untouchable\u2019 democrats. The legislation passed afterwards to stop such citizen action from happening again (professional political protection act) speaks strongly to that. Do you think the defeat of Speaker [Tom Foley was over taxes? People get angry over taxes, but they go psycho when rights they see as fundamental are trampled.\u201d \u2013 Michael North, Bryan, Ohio\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Goodness, Mr. North! I said the tax increase \u201chelped deliver\u201d Bush\u2019s 1992 loss. Gun control was certainly part of it, as was his support for the Clean Air Act, among other things. And the assault weapons ban was certainly a major factor in Clinton\u2019s 1994 midterm shellacking. But I would submit that nothing hurt Foley in his own loss more than his opposition to term limits. Voters of Washington had approved a state constitutional amendment imposing them and Foley sued to overturn the restriction. It\u2019s never good to be running for re-election when you\u2019re the lead plaintiff in the case of \u201cthe people of the state of Washington.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\u201cJust read your essay about tax reform. Very educational and it had me thinking. According to the Constitution, all tax legislation is required to start in the House. The House has relegated taxes to the Ways and Means Committee. What committee, some may ask? Yes, the Ways and Means Committee. One of the quietist committees on Capitol Hill. Just what have they been doing? I rarely, if ever, here from them. Back in the \u201880s they were heard from a lot. Even in the \u201890s. Since the beginning of this century, not so much. Just what has that committee been doing when everyone from both parties know that the country needs serious tax reform.\u201d \u2013 Onnie Duvall, Cambridge, Md.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: It would seem to me to be a tautology: less big tax legislation means that we will hear less from the tax writing legislation. But I would submit that it was still potent enough to serve as a stepping stone for current House Speaker Paul Ryan.]\n\n\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please\n\nmake sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n\n\nOH, HEYYYYYYYYY GUYS\u2026\n\nWBAL: \u201cTwo men who police said robbed a pub in Woodlawn [Md.] may not have expected it to be full of police officers. Baltimore County police have two suspects in custody who they said robbed a pub Tuesday night at gunpoint. The armed suspects walked in to Monaghan\u2019s Pub a little before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. It turns out that the pub was hosting a police officer\u2019s retirement party with dozens of off-duty officers in attendance. \u2026 Investigators said two men entered the take-out portion of the restaurant and held an employee up at gunpoint. \u2018At that time, the person who had been behind the counter knew that there was a retirement party for a police officer happening, so they went into the other portion and alerted the officers to the fact that they had just been involved in an armed robbery,\u2019 [Baltimore County police Officer Jennifer Peach] said.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.
