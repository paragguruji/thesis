More than half a dozen states were attempting to prevent the latest ban from taking effect early Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"This new order was tailored to the dictates of the Ninth Circuit's, in my opinion, flawed ruling,\" Trump said. \"This is, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.\n\n\"The law and the Constitution,\" the president argued to a cheering crowd, \"give the president the power to suspend immigration when he deems -- or she ... deems it to be in the national interest of our country.\"\n\nOn Air Force One late Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration stood by the initial executive order, which was halted by the appeals court last month.\n\n\"We believed the first one was accurate,\" Spicer said, \"[and] the second one was literally tailored to the court ruling.\" The spokesman said he did not know what the administration's next steps would be.\n\nThe travel ban was one of many topics Trump touched on during the campaign-style rally, including his joint effort with House Republicans to replace ObamaCare.\n\nAt one point, Trump invoked Tennessee native Andrew Jackson, a fellow populist outsider, and said the seventh president \"understood that real leadership means putting America first.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the president laid a wreath at Andrew Jackson's tomb to mark the 250th anniversary of the former president's birth, and toured the Hermitage, Jackson's home.\n\n\n\n\"We're keeping our promises,\" said Trump, noting that he's more than halfway through the 100-day measure by which new presidents are judged. \"And we have just gotten started. Wait till you see what's coming, folks.\"\n\nOn the flight back to Washington, he said he hoped to hold rallies \"every two weeks. I mean, these are great people.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "type": "article"}
