Roughly 300 people turned out holding signs opposed to the order and the Trump administration.\n\nPolice set up a perimeter around the growing crowd. But the event appeared peaceful at its outset. Organizers say they plan to march through the square to a nearby park.\n\nThe new measure prevents citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining U.S. visas for at least 90 days. It also suspends the refugee resettlement process for 120 days.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "type": "article"}
