And that happened. It happened in Europe, mainly in Germany,\" Assad said in a radio interview, Reuters reported.\n\nLawmakers have accused the Assad government of war crimes and even genocide as the number of people killed during the violence in Syria continues to mount.\n\nThe war, now in its sixth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, contributed to Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II and given the Islamic State group room to grow into a global terror threat.\n\nTrump has said Assad may be \"bad\" but the rebels fighting to topple him \"could be worse.\" He has said the U.S. has no idea who its allies in the country are and has appeared most concerned about containing the exodus of Syrian refugees, fearing they'll spread terrorism.\n\nAssad had previously suggested the U.S. and Syria could be \"natural allies.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s ban, in the meantime, has faced fierce legal challenges.\n\nA lawsuit by Washington state and Minnesota will proceed as an appellate court considers a preliminary injunction in the case, a federal court ruled on Monday.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: SHARP DIVISION ALONG POLITICAL LINES ON TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN\n\nThe Justice Department had wanted to put the case on hold while the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether a larger, 11-judge panel will review a government request to allow the ban.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge James Robart, who previously issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban, said the lawsuit can go forward. The states said that process wouldn't interfere with review by appellate courts.\n\nRobart directed both sides to prepare for their arguments on whether Trump's travel ban should be permanently blocked.\n\nA three-judge federal appeals court panel last week refused to toss out the injunction and reinstate the travel ban. The panel unanimously rejected the administration's claim of presidential authority in the matter.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
