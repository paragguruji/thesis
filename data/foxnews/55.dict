Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nEverybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2017\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday disputed the notion that Trump\u2019s order was a \u201cban.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne million people have come into this country. That\u2019s not a ban,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cA ban would mean people can\u2019t get in, and we\u2019ve clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries.\u201d\n\nThe rollout of the order during the weekend was rocky, with protests popping up in several airports around the country and some initial confusion over who was permitted to enter the U.S.\n\nBut Trump and his advisers have been steadfast about proceeding with the order, which has spurred sharp opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
