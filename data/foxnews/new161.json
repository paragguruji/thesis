However, Trump\u2019s tweets in all capital letters refer to the executive order as \u201ca TRAVEL BAN\u201d on \u201ccertain DANGEROUS countries\u201d and said anything short of a ban would jeopardize the safety and security of Americans.\n\nEven the husband of Kellyanne Conway argued Monday that the tweets could handicap the department\u2019s ability to do its job.\n\nGeorge Conway wrote on Twitter that Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cmay make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help OSG (Office of Solicitor General) get 5 votes in SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the United States), which is what actually matters. Sad.\u201d\n\nThe White House pushed back. Asked Monday whether the Trump team was concerned about the tweets tainting the case, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nBut Doug Schoen, former adviser to President Bill Clinton, told Fox News that Trump\u2019s tweets slamming his own lawyers could create problems.\n\n\u201cTo second guess your own side in the context of an ongoing fight, using language that is not helpful \u2026 it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Schoen, a Fox News contributor, said.\n\nTrump's tweets came after the government filed briefs with the high court last week urging justices to ignore polarizing and fiery comments Trump made multiple times during the campaign about the need for a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201c\n\nThey argued \u201ctaking that oath marks a profound transition from private life to the nation\u2019s highest public office, and manifests the singular responsibility and independent authority to protect the welfare of the nation that the Constitution reposes in the president.\u201d\n\nCecilia Wang, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing challengers to the ban from Maryland, argued Trump\u2019s tweets undermine the government\u2019s claims that both executive orders are not bans but merely temporary travel restrictions on a small group of nations.\n\n\u201cWith his four tweets this morning, the president is basically reaffirming whatever his intent was in the beginning,\u201d Wang told USA Today.\n\nNeal Katyal, a former acting U.S. solicitor general and the lead attorney representing challengers in a case from Hawaii, weighed in on Twitter that Trump\u2019s actions were working in favor of Katyal\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need the help but will take it!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush, told the Huffington Post that Trump\u2019s actions \u201cpresents a challenge that the Department of Justice will have to deal with.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s initial executive order, rolled out seven days after taking office in January, banned travel from seven mostly Muslim countries. The order sparked protests at airports around the country and brief detentions of hundreds of travelers. It was met with immediate resistance from the courts, with several federal district judges issuing orders blocking aspects of it.\n\nOn March 6, Trump issued a revised order that temporarily suspended travel of from six mostly Muslim countries: Yemen, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iran and Libya. The original ban included Iraq. The revised order also cleared up who the ban applies to, when it would go into effect and did not single out refugees from Syria by barring them indefinitely as the original version had.\n\nRegardless of changes, both orders were challenged in court on claims they were discriminatory on the basis of religion.", "authors": ["Barnini Chakraborty"], "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "trump", "tweets", "foes", "ban", "supreme", "court", "trumps", "order", "president", "threaten"], "summary": "President Trump\u2019s recent tweets about his controversial travel ban -- now before the U.S. Supreme Court -- could hurt his own case, with the administration's legal opponents already threatening to use the statements to their advantage.\n\"Yes, we may incorporate @realDonaldTrump's tweets about the ban into our Supreme Court argument,\" the ACLU said Monday.\nThe Trump tweets give courtroom foes an opportunity to seize on mixed messages out of the administration regarding the evolving set of executive orders.\nshould have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday.\nTrump\u2019s tweets came just a few days after the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court rulings that blocked the executive order suspending travel from six mostly Muslim countries."}
