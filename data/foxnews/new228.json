The painting was donated to the museum by the Munn family, also immigrants from Sweden.\n\nIn New York City, however, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is using a different tactic to highlight immigrants' artistic contributions.\n\nMoMA has redesigned its fifth-floor permanent-collection galleries to feature contemporary art from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, three of the seven countries whose citizens have been subject to the ban.\n\nFOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, works by Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid and Iranian artist Charles Hossein Zenderoudi have replaced pieces from renknowned artists like Picasso and Matisse. The works will be on display at the Manhattan museum for several months.\n\nAccompanying the newly installed pieces is a statement from the museum that reads:\n\n\u201cThis work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on January 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum\u2019s collection installed throughout the fifth-floor galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum, as they are to the United States.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-17", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["artworks", "travel", "immigrant", "college", "shrouds", "trump", "ban", "works", "immigrants", "galleries", "davis", "pieces", "order", "removes", "protest", "museum", "art", "museums"], "summary": "Two high-profile museums are weighing in on the debate surrounding President Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban, barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.\nIn reaction to the executive order, Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Boston announced Wednesday they would be removing paintings and shroud objects in black fabric that were either created by immigrant artists or donated to the museum by immigrants to highlight foreign-made contributions.\nThe Davis Museum describes the de-installation as \u201cArt-Less\" -- a \u201cprotest\u201d that began on Feb. 16 and will end on Tuesday, Feb. 21.\nThe painting was donated to the museum by the Munn family, also immigrants from Sweden.\nIn New York City, however, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is using a different tactic to highlight immigrants' artistic contributions."}
