Trump said, \"Bad people are very happy.\"\n\nThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nThe appeal says the temporary restraining order by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle is a broad overreach of judicial authority.\n\n\"Judicial second-guessing of the President's national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large,\" it says. The order also imposes harm on U.S. citizens \"by thwarting the legal effect of the public's chosen representative,\" it says.\n\nPresident Trump, at Mar-a-Lago for the weekend with the first lady to attend the Red Cross Ball, had this to say when a pool reporter asked if has confident he would prevail in court: \"We'll win,\" he replied. \"For the safety of the country, we'll win.\"\n\nThe State Department said it had reversed cancelling visas for related foreigners, after provisionally revoking as many as 60,000 of them to comply with Trump's Jan. 27 order.\n\nExpand / Contract Demonstrators march in London to protest President Trump's travel ban. (AP)\n\nThen Homeland Security announced that it would no longer be directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by the order from boarding U.S.-bound planes.\n\nThe agency also said that it had suspended \u201cany and all actions\" related to putting in place the terms of the order.\n\nHowever, by late Saturday afternoon, the response from international airlines still appeared in flux. Several were honoring the temporary halt, while some immigrants were still having trouble boarding planes to America.\n\nRoyal Jordanian, for example, had resumed flights from six of the seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Somalia -- as long as people presented valid visas or green cards.\n\nBut African immigration lawyer Julie Goldberg was struggling Saturday to arrange flights at Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport for stranded Yemeni citizens with visas.\n\nAnd Goldberg said she was told by Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines that immigrants from the seven countries are still not being allowed to fly.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order also halted a refugee program from the seventh country, war-torn Syria. He issued the temporary ban following his winning campaign promise to further protect Americans from what he calls \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nLike last weekend, when thousands of air travelers were detained at U.S. airports because the executive order was issued with no clear warning, widespread, peaceful demonstrations broke out Saturday.\n\nThey occurred again in New York and Washington, D.C., and in such places as Philadelphia, London and Paris.\n\nLater in the day Saturday, Trump said on Twitter: \"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\" He added that \"very bad and dangerous\" people may now come into the U.S. because of the judge's \"terrible\" ruling.\n\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nEarlier, Trump called the judge who issued the temporary restraining order a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and vowed that the order would be \u201coverturned!\u201d\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet about Robart also resulted in criticism from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\u201cThe president's attack \u2026 shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution,\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\n\"The president's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\" a White House statement said.\n\nThe halt late Friday was issued by Robart, who was an appointee of George W. Bush. He said that Washington state and Minnesota had standing to challenge Trump's executive order on immigration. So he issued the temporary, nationwide restraining order based on his opinion that the states showed their case is likely to succeed.\n\nWashington became the first state to sue over the order, and Minnesota joined the lawsuit two days later.\n\nFederal attorneys had argued that Congress gave the president authority to make decisions on national security and immigrant entry.\n\nThe two states won a temporary restraining order while the court considers the lawsuit, which aims to permanently block Trump's order. Court challenges have been filed nationwide from states and advocacy groups.\n\nJustice Department lawyers say about 100,000 visas -- not 60,000 -- had been revoked.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
