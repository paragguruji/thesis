Hawaii appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal and said while the judge can't clarify the Supreme Court's order, he can interpret it.\n\nHawaii then renewed its request with Watson in a different form.\n\nThe government filed court documents Tuesday opposing Hawaii's latest motion, saying the state is merely repackaging a previously rejected clarification request. The government says it's up to the Supreme Court to provide guidance.\n\nWatson could rule this week.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-07-11", "type": "article"}
