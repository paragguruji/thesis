Phil Bryant, laid out constitutional and federal statutory provisions defending Trump\u2019s authority. The attorneys general also defended Trump\u2019s \u201clawful actions\u201d to revise the executive order, which was blocked last month by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s revised immigration order is constitutional, lawful, addresses the 9th Circuit\u2019s concerns and is a vital step in securing our borders,\u201d Paxton said in a statement. \u201cA temporary pause in the national refugee program will give the government time to review and determine how we can improve the screening process for foreign nationals seeking to enter the U.S. from six countries designated as \u2018countries of concern\u2019.\u201d\n\nTexas is joined in the amicus brief by Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Mississippi.\n\nThe revised executive order still imposes a 90-day suspension of entry to the United States for nationals of several mostly Muslim countries: Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iran. Iraq was on the list in the original order but was removed after the Iraqi government agreed to increase cooperation with Washington on vetting travelers to the U.S.\n\nThe revised order also dropped language calling for an \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d of Syrian refugees; they are no longer singled out, which addresses an issue raised by the courts.\n\nThe new order also clarifies that foreign nationals from the six countries listed who already had valid visas as of Jan. 27 would not be affected. Further, the new order exempts green card holders and makes clear that legal permanent residents are not affected.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s revised immigration order is necessary to protect the homeland from those who wish us harm,\u201d Paxton said.\n\nFox News' Casey Stegall contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.
