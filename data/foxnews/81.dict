Jeff Sessions' policies on illegal immigration. (Sessions is now the U.S. attorney general.)\n\nA federal appeals court recently halted Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven mostly Muslim nations. And the Trump administration\u2019s attempt last week to have the ban lifted was denied.\n\nMiller on Sunday argued the appeal court has overstepped its authority, reasserting the president\u2019s powers and expressing confidence that Trump will prevail in his promise to stop radical Islamic terrorists from entering the United States.\n\n\u201cThe three judges made a broad, over-reaching statement,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe president\u2019s powers here are beyond question. \u2026 Something good is going to come out of this. The powers of the president will be confirmed.\u201d\n\nIn response to assertions that the executive orders were hastily crafted and executed, Miller argued they were drafted by \u201ccongressional experts\u201d and reviewed by lawyers and top federal agency officials.\n\nHe also argued that the three executive orders on immigration signed last month essentially remain in effect and that they have already \u201cprofoundly improved our national security.\u201d\n\nMiller also said that Assistant to the President Steve Bannon, who is considered a driving force behind Trump\u2019s immigration policies, had \u201cno role\u201d in the so-called roll out of the executive orders, which immediately created problems for travelers, including those with green cards, arriving at U.S. airports.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
