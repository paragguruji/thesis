The courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets were inflammatory. Rather than simply offering words of support \u2013 as he did in his more empathetic statements in reaction to the attacks in Manchester earlier this month, and Westminster in March \u2013 he is pushing forward with his own agenda, one of the only world leaders who has used the attack as a call to action.\n\nMore to the point, though, he is beginning to use international events to promote is own domestic agenda.\n\nBy focusing on the attacks in the U.K., he is hoping to garner greater support for his \u201ctravel ban,\u201d as well as other national security issues like the wall on the southern border. He views these attacks as opportunities to push his plans forward, regardless of the fear it stirs in the American public.\n\nHis comments towards Islam and terror, for instance, dominate the news cycle and hinder leaders like Khan from effectively responding to the attacks. All while continuing to play into his favor on the domestic side as he hopes the Supreme Court will uphold his \u201ctravel ban.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump has tied politics and terrorism. On a more domestic level, Trump has said he will cut federal funding to \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d One of the largest of these is New York City, which currently receives $190 million in funding from Homeland Security. NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill has called the funding \u201cthe backbone of our entire counterterrorism apparatus.\u201d By threating to remove funding over a difference of ideology, Trump is at risk of putting all of New York City at risk of a terror attack.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s recent international trip has shown, he is determined to forge stronger relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt \u2013 partnerships that will be critical to addressing the threat of terror both here at home and abroad. Relationships with our European allies \u2013 specifically our NATO partners \u2013 remain somewhat fragile, though clearly working cohesively with all our allies to drive out extremism globally is the best path forward.\n\nYet Trump continues his strategy of belittling and punishing those who disagree with him. He continues to target groups as a whole for the nation\u2019s problems and attempts to scapegoat the Islamic community for the global terror threat. This is the type of behavior that will only continue to radicalize fringe groups and will not bring us anywhere closer to a safer world.\n\nDouglas E. Schoen is a Fox News contributor.
