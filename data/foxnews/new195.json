The ban applies to people from Syria, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe news comes after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the ban in December 2017. At the time, the justices said the policy can take full effect despite multiple legal challenges against it that haven\u2019t yet made their way through the judicial system.\n\nSince the president signed an executive order in January establishing a ban on travel of people from Muslim-majority nations, it has been a point of contention and challenged in court. Here\u2019s a look at the ban\u2019s journey through the legal system.\n\nJan. 19 \u2013 Supreme Court announces it will rule on the travel ban\n\nThe Supreme Court announced on Jan. 19 that it will rule on Trump's controversial travel ban. The justices plan to hear arguments in April and issue a final ruling by late June.\n\nDec. 4 \u2013 Supreme Court OKs full enforcement of Trump travel ban\n\nHanding the White House a huge judicial victory, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Trump\u2019s travel ban affecting residents of six majority-Muslim countries.\n\nLower courts had said people from those countries with a \"bona fide\" relationship with someone in the United States could not be prevented from entry.\n\nGrandparents and cousins were among the relatives courts said could not be excluded.\n\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place.\n\nOct. 17 \u2013 Federal judge temporarily blocks travel ban\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request from Hawaii to temporarily block a version of Trump's travel ban, which was supposed to take effect at midnight ET on Oct. 18.\n\nHawaii argued that the revised ban \u2013 which included citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and some Venezuelan government officials and their families \u2013 was a continuation of Trump's \"promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.\"\n\n\"Today\u2019s dangerously flawed district court order undercuts the President\u2019s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States,\" the White House said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President\u2019s lawful action.\"\n\nOct. 10 \u2013 Supreme Court dismisses one case\n\nThe Supreme Court didn\u2019t take action on a case that originated in Hawaii pertaining to Trump\u2019s travel ban and a ban on refugees.\n\nHowever, it did dismiss another case that originated in Maryland. That case involved a ban that has since expired and been replaced with a new one by the administration.\n\nOct. 5 \u2013 Justice Department asks Supreme Court to drop travel ban case\n\nThe Department of Justice asked the nation\u2019s highest court to dismiss the case challenging the administration\u2019s travel ban. The administration argued the case should be dismissed because it was regarding a previous travel ban that is now moot.\n\nSept. 24 \u2013 Trump signs new travel ban\n\nAs Trump\u2019s original ban was set to expire, the president unveiled new restrictions on travel to the U.S. from certain countries\u2019 citizens.\n\nThe revised ban included citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also included some government officials from Venezuela.\n\nSept. 12 \u2013 Supreme Court lifts restrictions\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked a lower court\u2019s decision that would have allowed refugees to enter the country under certain conditions, blocking a ruling that said a resettlement agency counts as a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d\n\nSept. 7 \u2013 Appeals court limits travel ban\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that would allow for more refugees to enter the country despite the ban. The federal court ruled that refugees working with a resettlement agency would be considered to have established an approved \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a contact in the U.S.\n\nWHO DOES TRUMP\u2019S TRAVEL BAN BLOCK FROM ENTERING THE US?\n\nIt also expanded the scope of a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to include other family members, such as grandparents and other relatives.\n\nJuly 19 \u2013 Supreme Court allows for strict enforcement of refugee ban\n\nThe Supreme Court, temporarily, allowed for the administration\u2019s travel ban to keep a strict enforcement on its ban of refugees. It did, however, leave in place the court order that made it easier for travelers from the six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S. and allowed a previous expansion of \u201cbona fide relationships\u201d to stay.\n\nJuly 13 \u2013 Federal judge expands scope of travel ban\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii, ruled that a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d certain travelers need before entering the U.S. could be expanded to include grandparents and other relatives.\n\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court for clarification.\n\nJune 29 \u2013 Travel ban goes into effect\n\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the Trump administration issued guidance on who would be allowed into the country and who would be barred.\n\nJune 26 \u2013 Supreme Court allows for travel ban to continue\n\nThe Supreme Court announced it would allow Trump to forge ahead with a limited version of his travel ban. Trump hailed the decision as a \u201cvictory for national security.\u201d\n\nHAWAII GETS CHANCE TO MAKE CASE FOR FIGHTING 3RD TRAVEL BAN\n\nThe court said it would hear arguments in October, but until then, the ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could be enforced if the visitors lacked a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nMay 25 \u2013 Travel ban blocked by federal court\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia blocked the travel ban from being implemented. It had begun to hear the case earlier in May.\n\n\u201cWe remain unconvinced [the ban] has more to do with national security than it does with effectuating the President\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\" the court said at the time.\n\nMarch 30 \u2013 Trump administration appeals ruling\n\nThe Department of Justice filed an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the ruling against the travel ban.\n\nMarch 29 \u2013 Federal judge continues to block travel ban\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request to continue to halt the travel ban.\n\nMarch 16 \u2013 Another federal judge temporarily blocks the order\n\nSitting in Maryland, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang temporarily halted the executive order. The injunction was not as comprehensive as the one issued earlier in Hawaii, but it did contend that the ban was discriminatory toward Muslims.\n\nMEGA-COMPANIES DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM CHARITIES FOUND DONATING TO ANTI-TRUMP GROUP\n\nThe order did not change the previous injunction in Hawaii, but rather just reinforced it.\n\nMarch 15 \u2013 Federal judge blocks travel ban\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson prevented the travel ban from being implemented just before it was set to take effect. Watson granted the state of Hawaii\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order.\n\nTrump called the decision an \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach.\u201d\n\nMarch 8 \u2013 Hawaii sues to block the travel ban\n\nThe state of Hawaii sued in an attempt to halt the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban from going into effect. Lawyers said the \u201cnew executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the State of Hawaii contrary to its state Constitution.\u201d\n\nLawyers also argued that the ban would damage Hawaii\u2019s \u201ceconomy, educational institutions and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state\u2019s citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society.\u201d\n\nMarch 6 \u2013 Trump unveils new travel ban\n\nTrump signed a new executive order which barred travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days \u2013 removing Iraq from the new ban.\n\nThe new order also exempted permanent residents and current visa holders from the travel ban. Syrian refugees were still included in the new order but only for 120 instead of indefinitely.\n\nFeb. 15 \u2013 Trump\u2019s travel ban gets a defender\n\nTexas Attorney Ken Paxton split with other states and defended the travel ban as he filed documents with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking to reconsider a decision blocking the ban.\n\nPaxton argued that the order is a legal exercise of presidential authority.\n\nFeb. 13 \u2013 Federal judge grants injunction against ban\n\nA federal judge in Virginia granted an injunction to prevent the administration from implementing the ban.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said the ban was unconstitutional as it had a religious bias.\n\nFeb. 9 \u2013 Travel ban is again blocked\n\nThe travel ban\u2019s suspension was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a unanimous decision.\n\nMUSLIM ADVOCATES, LEGAL ORG FILES SUITS OVER TRAVEL BAN\n\nThose judges were Michelle Friedland, appointed by former President Barack Obama; Richard Clifton, appointed by former President George W. Bush; and William Canby, appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe court began to hear arguments from the Justice Department and lawyers from the states of Washington and Maryland \u2013 in opposition to the ban \u2013 on Feb. 7.\n\nFeb. 6 \u2013 Justice Department asks federal court to intervene\n\nThe Justice Department filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking it to intervene and reverse a previous judge\u2019s decision to halt the travel ban.\n\nSixteen attorneys general filed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit against the travel ban. Those included: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, D.C.\n\nFeb. 3 \u2013 Judge declines to extend injunction against travel ban\n\nU.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton did not extend a temporary injunction against the administration\u2019s travel ban.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle did issue a temporary block of the ban on the same day.\n\n\u201cThe state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,\u201d Robart said as he ruled in favor of lawyers from the states of Washington and Minnesota.\n\nFeb. 1 \u2013 Administration tweaks travel ban\n\nThe Trump administration tweaked its travel ban to exempt legal permanent residents of the U.S.\n\nAFGHAN GIRLS ROBOTICS TEAM ARRIVES IN US JUST IN TIME\n\n\u201cThey no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of green card holders.\n\nJan. 30 \u2013 Senate Republicans save travel ban from Democrats\n\nSenate Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats to overturn the executive order. When Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. sought a vote on legislation to reverse the ban, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., objected.\n\nTrump also fired acting Attorney Gen. Sally Yates on this day when she refused to defend the travel ban.\n\nJan. 29 \u2013 Temporary stay issued on travel ban\n\nA Boston federal court temporarily put Trump\u2019s travel ban on hold for one week.\n\nThe ruling stipulated that previously approved refugees, valid visa holders and lawful permanent residents or travelers from the seven countries included in Trump\u2019s order could not be detained or removed from the U.S. because of the executive order.\n\nJan. 28 \u2013 Federal judge issues emergency injunction against ban\n\nA federal judge in New York issued an emergency order blocking, in part, the executive order.
