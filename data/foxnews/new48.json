But we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d Trump said Sunday afternoon. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. \u2026 My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d\n\nTrump issued the statement as hundreds of protesters marched in Washington and in other cities across the country to protest the president's self-described \u201cextreme vetting\u201d -- which resulted this weekend in dozens of foreign visitors and some legal permanent U.S. residents being detained at domestic airports.\n\nEarlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., staged a press conference with some immigrant children and adults impacted by the bans and vowed to fight them on Capitol Hill \u201cwith every fiber of my being.\u201d\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said that she would introduce two bills Monday. One of the bills would rescind Trump's order, while the other would give Congress greater oversight of the president's immigration authority.\n\nAnd California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa said the executive orders on illegal immigration \u201cdirectly challenge the right to due process under the Constitution\u201d and that he\u2019ll introduce legislation to fund legal aid to those who are \u201ctargeted.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats led by Schumer, who said he\u2019s already appealed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, will have a difficult task getting any kind of measure through the Republican-control Congress that would reverse the executive order.\n\n\u201cI doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks. I think they\u2019re wondering why we don\u2019t do that already,\u201d said Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, who as an Army officer served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHowever, Trump is facing opposition for some congressional Republicans, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, and Barbara Comstock, of Virginia, along with Sens. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and John McCain, of Arizona.\n\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d Graham and McCain said in a joint statement. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nTrump, a Republican, tweeted in response that the statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that the senators were \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe executive order Trump issued Friday imposes a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon -- as reports surfaced about foreign visitors being detained at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport and elsewhere -- Trump said his plan to prevent Islamic terrorists and others for attacking the United States was \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d\n\nBut by Saturday evening, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued a temporary halt on the part of the executive order that allows the Trump administration to deport people from the largely-Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cThese are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists.\u201d\n\nAnd White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus argued that as many as 80 percent of Americans agree with the policy change, while dismissing media reports about chaotic scenes Saturday at U.S. airports.\n\n\u201cI do not think there was any chaos,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d while predicting more people will be detained and offering \u201cno apologies.\u201d\n\nPriebus also seemed to suggest that foreign arrivals who have so-called \u201cgreen cards\u201d that allows them to permanently live and work in the United States will not be subject to the additional screenings.\n\n\u201cAs far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d he told NBC.\n\nKelly said later that allowed green card holders into the country was \"in the national interest\u201d of the country.\n\nAnd Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Trump's order had been \"poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\"\n\nTrump, Conway and Priebus argued Sunday that the seven countries were in fact identified by President Obama in 2015 and pointed out that roughly 40 other such nations included Afghanistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were not part of the travel ban.\n\nTrump is also facing opposition from attorneys general in 15 states and the District of Columbia, who issued a statement Sunday condemning his order as \u201cunconstitutional, un-American and unlawful.\u201d", "authors": ["Joseph Weber"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["america", "executive", "backlash", "extreme", "amid", "trump", "foreign", "vetting", "statement", "order", "states", "serve", "country", "trumps", "issued", "priority", "protect", "president"], "summary": "\u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants, and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression.\nBut we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d Trump said Sunday afternoon.\nOne of the bills would rescind Trump's order, while the other would give Congress greater oversight of the president's immigration authority.\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d Graham and McCain said in a joint statement.\nAnd Tennessee GOP Sen.
