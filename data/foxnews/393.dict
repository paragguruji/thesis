It is not enough just to be outraged. Injustice has to actually be defied.\u201d\n\nTaylor also said Trump \u201cempowered an attorney general who embraces and promulgates policies that have already proven to have had a devastating impact on black families and communities.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced May 12 that he has told prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible against criminal suspects -- a reversal of Obama-era policies, and a move that infuriated civil rights groups.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-28", "type": "article"}
