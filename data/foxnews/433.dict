He denied the accusations and denounced what he called a \"relentless character assassination\" in the media.\n\nYOUTUBE GONE WRONG\n\nIn what family members describe as a YouTube stunt gone wrong, a 22-year-old man from Halstad, Minnesota is dead and his pregnant girlfriend is in jail.\n\nAround 6:30 p.m. Monday night, Norman County sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to the 500 block of U.S. Highway 75 on a report of a shooting. Life-saving efforts were made and a medical helicopter was called, but a 22-year-old died.\n\nCOMING UP ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n7:30am ET - John Podesta will be on \u2018Mornings with Maria\u2019\n\n8 AM ET: Dr. Tom Price, Health And Human Services Secretary will appear on Mornings with Maria\n\n8:30 AM ET: Madeleine Albright, Former Secretary Of State Under President Clinton And Albright Stonebridge Group Chairman will be a guest on Mornings with Maria\n\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\n\n5 PM ET: Anthony Scarramucci will be on \u2018Risk & Reward\u2019\n\nCOMING UP ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\n9:30 AM ET: AG Jeff Sessions delivers speech at the summit of the Hate Crimes Subcommittee.
