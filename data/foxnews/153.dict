A ruling on the matter could come as early as Friday.\n\n\u201cThe ability to come in to the United States of America is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe cited the recent terror attacks in Kabul \u2013 outside an ice cream parlor \u2013 and in Manchester \u2013 near a concert hall \u2013 as part of the reason the travel ban and \u201cextreme vetting\u201d were so essential to U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cIn both cases what we see if a grim reminder of the ruthlessness of those who threaten our country and threaten our allies,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence also applauded Trump\u2019s Thursday decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, a long-anticipated exit that was cheered on the right and jeered on the left \u2013 both at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWhat the world witnessed yesterday was an American president putting America first,\u201d said Pence, who called the climate accord an \u201cextraordinary burden on the American economy\u201d that nevertheless allowed competing powers to go largely unchecked.\n\nPence, countering those who said America was giving up a position of authority in international issues by pulling out of the agreement, said the U.S. intended \u201cto lead in the world, not follow in the world.\u201d But he also framed the climate deal announcement as another example of Trump not straying from the promises he made while campaigning for the White House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting the American worker and the American economy first,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence called it \u201chumbling\u201d to be part of the Trump team, ticking off what he saw as the administration\u2019s numerous early successes: stepping up the war on ISIS, establishing border integrity, tending to a surging economy and appointing a conservative justice to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s startling to some of the elites in this country and around the world about President Donald Trump,\u201d Pence said, \u201cis he\u2019s doing exactly what he said he would do.\u201d", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "type": "article"}
