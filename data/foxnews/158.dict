Sad,\u201d tweeted George Conway, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.\n\nThe remark was posted above a retweet from Trump\u2019s Monday morning Twitter tear, in which he wrote: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\u201d\n\nConway also tweeted a link to a Washington Post analysis speculating that the president\u2019s tweets could hurt the administration\u2019s defense of the travel ban at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cVery good analysis,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe commentary came as Conway\u2019s wife Kellyanne was on air Monday morning defending the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn a string of subsequent tweets, Mr. Conway made clear he continues to \u201cVERY, VERY STRONGLY support\u201d Trump, his policies, the executive order, \u201cand of course, my wonderful wife.\u201d\n\nBut he said, \u201cEvery sensible lawyer in WHCO and every political ... appointee at DOJ wd agree with me (as some have already told me). The pt cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters .. seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS--and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it.\u201d\n\nTRUMP RIPS DOJ\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said on Twitter that they \u201cmay incorporate\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets on the ban \u201cinto our Supreme Court argument.\u201d But asked Monday whether the White House was concerned about tainting the case, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\nConway, who had been considered a frontrunner to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, took himself out of consideration for the job on Friday.\n\n\u201cI have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government,\u201d Conway said in a statement at the time. \u201cKellyanne and I continue to support the President and his Administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government.\u201d\n\nConway has only tweeted 93 times and the last time was in December 2015, when he retweeted a video about the New York Giants.\n\nFox News' Cody Derespina contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "type": "article"}
