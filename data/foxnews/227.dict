Many cruise lines say the impact from the president's exectuive order is likely to be minimal but they are now working to accommodate guests that may be affected.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line's Chief Communications Officer Roger Frizzell told Fox News that his company \"didn't see any impact over the weekend\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201cforesee any real impact going forward.\u201d\n\nTHE 4 BEST NEW LUXURY CRUISES\n\nA spokeswoman for Norwegian, which operates Oceania and Regent Seven Seas, told Fox News that its lines are all \"reviewing the recent executive order on immigration and will continue to work with the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, as well as local and regional authorities, in order to comply with all governmental policies.\"\n\nSo far, no Norwegian guests or crew members have been impacted by the ban but each line is encouraging guests to thoroughly review current State Department visa and travel documentation requirements. The lines are offering affected guests the chance to cancel without penalty.\n\nBut at least one cruiser was caught off guard by the measure.\n\nMaysam Sodagari, a chemical engineer from Iran who lives in San Francisco, was nearing the end of a seven-day cruise in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico on Friday when he learned about Trump\u2019s travel ban. Sodagari, who holds a valid green card, was unsure if he\u2019d be able to go back home and when the ship docked in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Sunday, he was taken to the Customs and Border Protection office and held for three hours.\n\nLate in the day, after the White House clarified that permanent residents with green cards would be permitted to re-enter the U.S., he was released to go home to California.\n\nSodagari\u2019s story may be disconcerting to cruise industry leaders who want to ensure passengers have a fun and safe time at sea, but even Royal Caribbean says the travel ban is unlikely to have a major impact on business.\n\nFOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK\n\n\u201cOur records indicate only a minimal number of our guests are citizens of the countries affected by the executive order and its apparent requirements,\u201d said Owen Torres, global corporate communications representative for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. \u201cWe are reaching out to those guests individually to discuss their options.\u201d\n\nBut others appear more concerned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from cruise lines and airports in our state, the tourism sector, concerned with the visa waiver interview process,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told reporters Monday night.\n\n\"And there aren\u2019t a lot of answers as of today. In fact, my staff was told the State Department, as of today, was ordered not to talk to Congress about this issue.\u201d\n\nTravel and Leisure, which has put together a list of tips for travelers, suggests green card and visa holders should take extra precautions to ensure they have all their documentation in order when re-entering the U.S., including a passport from their home country and their U.S. residence card.\n\nDisney Cruise Line and Holland America Line did not immediately respond to requests for comments.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
