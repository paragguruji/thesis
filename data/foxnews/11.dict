The video, which showed Corden moving the security check, ordering a grilled cheese sandwich and boarding a flight, ended with a black slate noting that this week\u2019s episodes were pre-taped as Corden left Los Angeles on Monday.\n\n\u201cFreedom of movement should be this easy for all legal immigrants. Not just the white and Christian ones,\u201d the slate read. LAX was among several major airports where protestors have gathered in recent days to\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cDaily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d and \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d all delivered segments on the ban. Fallon did his in full Trump impersonation mode.\n\nCBS\u2019 \u201cLate Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d also had a video cold open that was a reaction to Trump senior advisor Steve Bannon saying in an interview with the New York Times that journalists should \u201ckeep their mouths shut\u201d for a period during the new administration. The video showed \u201cFace the Nation\u201d anchor John Dickerson and frequent panelists on CBS\u2019 Sunday morning public affairs show, including Bob Woodward and Peggy Noonan, sitting around a table with their lips tight.\n\nColbert, who was back with new episodes after taking last week off, said the poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty has been revised to read: \u201cDon\u2019t let it hit ya where the good lord split ya.\u201d\n\nColbert and Meyers both zeroed in on the fact that only true outrage could drive people to go the airport without travel plans.\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea how angry people have to be to voluntarily go to JFK?\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cIf you can spend more than two hours at JFK without losing your @#$%, you should get automatic citizenship,\u201d Meyers observed.\n\nNoah summed up the events of the weekend by asserting: \u201cNo matter how bad the situation you\u2019re in, Donald Trump can always make it worse.\u201d", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
