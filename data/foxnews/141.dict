A revised order also is on hold in the courts.\n\nHowever, DHS spokesman David Lapan told reporters Tuesday that some vetting policies at U.S. borders have changed.\n\nLapan would not go into detail about the additional procedures, saying, \"That, we're not making public.\"\n\nDHS officials told Fox News the additional vetting entails steps they already have the authority to implement absent an update to the actual statute.\n\n\"We use algorithms to determine who might need additional screening,\" one DHS official said.\n\nAny foreign national traveling to the U.S. from overseas is potentially subject to these additional vetting procedures.\n\nThe comments come after the State Department also announced new proposals last week to boost screening of certain visa applicants.\n\nThe State Department published a notice in the Federal Register seeking feedback on proposals to have certain applicants provide information including: social media handles, phone numbers and emails for the last five years, prior passport numbers and additional information about their family, past travel and employment.\n\nJake Gibson is a producer working at the Fox News Washington bureau who covers politics, law enforcement and intelligence issues.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-09", "type": "article"}
