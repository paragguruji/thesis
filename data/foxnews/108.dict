Trump's wiretapping claim (and press excluded)", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/07/trumps-travel-ban-overshadowed-by-trumps-wiretapping-claim-and-press-excluded.html", "text": "The Trump administration is suddenly making a whole lot of news.\n\nThe long-delayed rollout of a new temporary travel ban took place yesterday\u2014with Donald Trump offstage and three Cabinet secretaries in the spotlight\u2014reflecting a signature campaign issue for the president.\n\nThe White House is also working with Hill Republicans on an ObamaCare replacement bill with the aim of unveiling it this week.\n\nWhen I talk to administration officials, they say these are precisely the kind of issues that ordinary folks care about and the media should cover them more. Fair point.\n\nBut the reason these policy initiatives are having to compete for ink and airtime is the president\u2019s own doing.\n\nHis weekend tweeting of an unproven allegation that Barack Obama had him wiretapped during the campaign caused a media explosion. And it\u2019s hard to complain about the media\u2019s priorities when the president accuses a former president of doing something that nefarious and everyone scrambles to cover it.\n\nSince then, Republican members of Congress, such as Jason Chaffetz and Tom Cotton, have said in television interviews that they don\u2019t have any evidence to support Trump\u2019s allegation.\n\nThe FBI has leaked word that James Comey has no such evidence and wants the Justice Department to say so in a statement. (He\u2019s suddenly publicity-shy?) Former intelligence director James Clapper flatly denied any such wiretapping.\n\nKellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders have said on the air that Trump believes the wiretapping happened, that he has access to intelligence that others don\u2019t and that congressional investigations should look at this\u2014but have provided no further evidence.\n\nNews outlets have been filled with such stories as \u201cA Conspiracy Theory Born on Talk Radio\u201d (New York Times); \u201cInside Trump\u2019s Fury: The President Rages at Leaks, Setbacks and Accusations\u201d (Washington Post); \u201cWiretapping Allegations Accomplished What Trump Wanted\u2014But May Backfire\u201d (Post); \u201cPoll: Most Back Special Prosecutor for Russia Investigation\u201d (CNN, and it\u2019s 65 percent); and \u201cKnives Are Out for Reince\u201d (Politico).\n\nBy the way, after every administration controversy there are leak-filled stories about how Reince Priebus is in trouble, but Trump is continuing to back his chief of staff.\n\nNow there\u2019s been a fair amount of coverage of the revised travel ban, replacing the one that was blocked by a federal appeals court: It doesn\u2019t take effect for 10 days, green-card holders are exempt and Iraq has been removed from the original list of seven countries.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s telling. Sean Spicer\u2019s regular White House briefing was switched to an off-camera gaggle yesterday, and what was to have been the first televised State Department press briefing was canceled.\n\nOne might assume that the new ban was announced by Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions and John Kelly to show the greater preparation that went into drafting it. But they took no questions, and the press pool wasn\u2019t even allowed in to watch the president sign the executive order.\n\nMy assumption is that Trump wanted to avoid reporters shouting questions about the wiretapping allegation, which would distract from the news he wanted to make by highlighting the news he was trying to leave behind.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m.).
