Whether it\u2019s individuals who want to see the U.S. or companies planning travel for corporate events, many in the industry are expecting fewer people to visit America in the foreseeable future.\n\nAlly Bolour, a Los Angeles-based attorney who immigrated to the U.S. from Iran as a child in the 1970s, said he has friends overseas who now say they won\u2019t come for a visit.\n\n\u201cThey want me to come to them,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cThe uncertainty of everything, and keeping people in suspense, keeps people from traveling. There's a chilling effect.\u201d\n\nHe added that he is advising his clients who are not U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to America unless they absolutely must.\n\nNYC & Company, which promotes tourism in New York City, announced Tuesday that it expects 300,000 fewer international travelers will visit New York this year, based on data from Tourism Economics. The report cited changing attitudes about traveling to the U.S. and Trump\u2019s stance on immigration to be responsible for the decline.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nBut Jason Clampet, CEO and co-founder of travel research site Skift, said Trump isn\u2019t solely to blame. He pointed his finger at the strong U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cPeople make travel decisions with their wallets,\u201d Clampet told Fox News. \u201cThe dollar is very strong right now. Then you add the emotional feelings around choosing a place to travel\u2026 If you think you\u2019re going to be hassled, you think maybe we\u2019ll go someplace where we won\u2019t be hassled.\n\n\u201cEven with the business traveler, there\u2019s an emotional element,\u201d Clampet continued.\n\n\u201cLeadership in the U.S. has been doing things on a whim, and it leaves people making decisions for their companies\u2026 They\u2019re being overly cautious even in business, and we might see this for years to come as travel is planned so far ahead of time.\u201d\n\nCompared to the same dates in 2016, searches for international flights to the U.S. dropped 6.5 percent in the eight days after Trump signed the travel ban, according to ForwardKeys, which monitors travel patterns.\n\n\u201cThe data forces a compelling conclusion that Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban immediately caused a significant drop in bookings\u2026 and an immediate impact on future travel,\u201d ForwardKeys CEO Olivier Jager told the Boston Globe.\n\nJonathan Grella, senior vice president of public affairs for the U.S. Travel Association, said he hopes Trump will be more deliberate in revising the ban, which was halted in federal court.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the first CEO president, a hotelier and branding guru,\u201d Grella said. \u201cHe, among all presidents, should understand instinctively putting our best foot forward and understanding that people have choices where they vacation and go on business.\n\n\u201cWe hope that our industry has the chance to make the case to the president that we\u2019d be leaving money on the table turning people away. If we put all our chips toward security, we\u2019ll have other problems to deal with in the aftermath.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is so hopeful \u2013 especially when it comes to business travel.\n\nDENTIST CLAIMS HE WAS REMOVED FROM FLIGHT AFTER MAKING ANTI-TRUMP REMARK\n\nAdam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, told The New York Times that the number of annual visitors to the U.S. could fall by 6.3 million from 2016 to 2018, due to Trump\u2019s words and actions (even before taking office), such as his pledges to pull out of international trade agreements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a very challenging year for U.S. travel,\u201d Sacks told The New York Times.\n\nIn 2015, the latest year for which official figures have been calculated by the Department of Commerce, the U.S. saw a record 77.5 million international visitors.\n\nAbout half of European travel buyers who participated in a Global Business Travel Association survey said they expect their companies to cut business travel to the U.S. as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cThey see the protests,\u201d Bolour said. \u201cThey see Trump not making sense to any reasonable person and a Congress that gives him a green light. They see Muhammad Ali\u2019s son getting stopped at the airport. It all has an effect.\u201d\n\nNYC & Company told The Times it plans to change its overseas advertising. As a start, it will replace its billboards with new ones that proclaim New York City is \u201cWelcoming the World.\u201d\n\nRebekah Sager is a writer and editor for FoxNews.com.
