It leaves the door open for even further restrictions.\"\n\nThe new order bars new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim nations and temporarily shuts down America's refugee program, affecting would-be visitors and immigrants from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.\n\nHawaii\u2019s anticipated action does not prevent other states from challenging the revised travel ban.\n\nTuesday's filing informs the court that the state has been in touch with the Justice Department and that both sides are asking for an expedited briefing schedule to allow for a judicial ruling before March 16.\n\nLast month, U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu allowed the state to file an amended lawsuit adding the Muslim Association of Hawaii's imam as a plaintiff.
