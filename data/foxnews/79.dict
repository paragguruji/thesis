The controversial measure suspended the U.S. refugee program as well as travel and immigration for residents of seven countries in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTrump gave no indication at Friday\u2019s press conference whether he was considering this step, saying only that they\u2019d continue to work through the court process \u2013 and do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d to protect the country.\n\nThe Justice Department is weighing its options, which also include appealing to a broader panel of judges or the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision Thursday was made by a panel of three judges with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco.\n\nIn their unanimous decision, the judges refused to reinstate Trump's immigration order and rejected the government\u2019s position that such presidential decisions on immigration policy are \u201cunreviewable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201c\u2026Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe decision does not end the court fight, but marked another setback in the president\u2019s bid to suspend certain programs to examine how the U.S. can better vet those seeking admission to the country.\n\nTrump and Abe left Washington on Air Force One Friday afternoon for a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Trump and Abe are scheduled to play golf in south Florida on Saturday.\n\nEarlier Friday, Abe touted the role of Japanese businesses in supporting thousands of jobs in the U.S. Speaking at the Chamber of Commerce, Abe said that \"a whopping majority\" of the Japanese cars running on American roads are manufactured in the U.S. by American workers.\n\nTrump has criticized Toyota Motor Corp. for planning to build an assembly plant in Mexico and complained that Japanese consumers don't buy enough U.S.-made cars. Abe said it was an honor to be meeting Trump less than a month after his inauguration, showing the \"unwavering alliance\" between the two countries.\n\nTrump also affirmed the U.S.-Japan alliance in his opening remarks Friday, calling it the \u201ccornerstone of peace and stability\u201d in the Pacific region. He stressed the importance of investing \u201cheavily\u201d in their defensive capabilities.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
