Yates was fired in January after telling her staff at the Department of Justice not to implement the order.\n\n\u201cI did my job the best way I knew how,\u201d Yates told senators during the hearing.\n\nYates noted that a federal appeals court blocked the order, forcing the Trump administration to revisit and re-work the order. But Republican senators attacked Yates for refusing to defend the order.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cited a statute in the U.S. Code granting presidents the right to impose restrictions on those seeking to enter the country if he believes there to be a security risk, but Yates countered by arguing that it is also prohibited to restrict immigrants based on race or religion.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has said the order is not a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d Yates and judges ruling against the order have pointed to rhetoric during the presidential campaign in which Trump promised an outright ban on Muslims into the country.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, also pushed back against Yates\u2019 decision, saying he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in her refusal to defend the order. He noted that the Office of Legal Counsel had concluded the law was lawful and properly drafted.\n\n\"I find it enormously disappointing that you somehow vetoed the decision of the Office of Legal Counsel...and decided instead that you would countermand the executive order of [President Trump] because you happened to disagree with it as a policy matter,\" Cornyn said.\n\n\u201cI made a determination that I believed that it was unlawful. I also thought that it was inconsistent with the principles of the Department of Justice,\u201d Yates responded. \u201cAnd I said no.\u201d\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., was more aggressive in his approach, questioning whether Yates had the authority to declare the order unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cWho appointed you to the Supreme Court of the United States?\u201d he asked her.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.
