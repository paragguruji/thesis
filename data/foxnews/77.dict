Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017\n\nThe writer, Brookings fellow and Lawfare editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes, had noted the order skipped over a key part of the U.S. code on \u201cinadmissible aliens\u201d which Trump had publicly recited on Wednesday in defense of his immigration restrictions.\n\nREAD THE COURT ORDER\n\nThe statute reads in part: \u201cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nWittes wrote that this statute speaks to one of two \u201cbig questions\u201d on which the case will turn.\n\nHe said the statute indeed gives Trump \u201csweeping power\u201d to restrict entry, writing: \u201cRemarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this statute, which forms the principal statutory basis for the executive order (see Sections 3(c), 5(c), and 5(d) of the order). That\u2019s a pretty big omission over 29 pages, including several pages devoted to determining the government\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits of the case.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to that statute for days in defending the controversial move to suspend refugee admissions as well as travel and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries.\n\nCLINTON TROLLS TRUMP\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, though, declined to lift a lower-court ruling that suspended the policy on other grounds.\n\nIn their unanimous decision, the judges generally referred to the government\u2019s position that such presidential decisions on immigration policy are \u201cunreviewable\u201d \u2013 but rejected that argument.\n\n\u201cThere is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201c\u2026Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe ruling did address what Wittes said was the other \u201cbig\u201d question at play: How statements from the president and his campaign team could \u201crender an otherwise valid exercise of this power invalid.\u201d\n\nThis aspect pertains to past statements by Trump and his advisers that they were looking at ways to suspend immigration to the U.S. for Muslims. While the administration now insists this is not a \u201cMuslim\u201d ban, the states challenging the order say it violates the establishment and equal protection clauses of the Constitution because it was meant to target Muslims \u2013 pointing to the president\u2019s past statements and other factors.\n\nThe court wrote: \u201cThe States\u2019 claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department is now reviewing its options -- which include the possibility of appealing the matter to the Supreme Court, asking for a review from a broader panel of judges or taking the dispute back to the lower court. Or the White House could issue a revised order.\n\nTrump tweeted overnight, \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT,\u201d without specifying which court.\n\nWittes argued that the 9th Circuit was right to leave the restraining order in place, \u201cfor the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nBefore the measure was put on hold, Trump\u2019s order caused chaos at airports amid confusion over which travelers were affected. Green-card holders initially were thought to be included in the freeze, though the Homeland Security Department later made clear they were exempt.\n\nWittes cautioned in his post that the fight over the merits is different than the battle that just played out in San Francisco: \u201cEventually, the court has to confront the clash between a broad delegation of power to the President\u2014a delegation which gives him a lot of authority to do a lot of not-nice stuff to refugees and visa holders\u2014in a context in which judges normally defer to the president, and the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.\u201d", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
