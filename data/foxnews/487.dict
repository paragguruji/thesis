His company plans to start building two resorts in Indonesia this year that Trump's business is associated with through management and licensing deals.\n\nNational police spokesman Rikwanto said Tanoe is accused of sending threats last year through text messages to Yulianto, a deputy attorney general for special crime who investigated a 2009 graft case related to Mobile-8 Telecom, a telecommunications company that Tanoe once owned. Police plan to question Tanoe next week.\n\nRikwanto said Yulianto reported Tanoe to police early last year after receiving threatening messages from the tycoon believed to be connected to tax restitution offenses against one of Tanoe's companies. Like many Indonesians, Rikwanto and Yulianto use only one name.\n\nUnder Indonesian law, using technology to threaten people is punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nTanoe's lawyer, Hotman Paris Hutapea, denied the allegations, saying the messages sent from Tanoe's cellphone did not contain any threats to a particular person.\n\n\"My client has no intention to threaten any individual,\" Hutapea said, calling the case \"politically motivated.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "type": "article"}
