Several groups in opposition have called the order blatant religious discrimination, since the six countries involved have mostly Muslim populations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nClinton appointed Hawkins in 1994 after Hawkins served as Arizona\u2019s top federal prosecutor from 1977 to 1980 and as a U.S. Marine Corps judge deciding court Martials from 1973 to 1976.\n\nIn 2012, Hawkins joined Judge Stephen Reinhardt's majority ruling striking down California's gay marriage ban. It was the first federal appeals court ruling that determined gay marriage bans were unconstitutional.\n\nGould was appointed by Clinton in 1999. He was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart from 1974 to 1975 and worked at the prominent Perkins Coie law firm before his appointment to the court of appeals. Gould listens to oral arguments electronically from his Seattle court because of multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn 2014, he wrote the majority decision that high schools must provide the same athletic amenities to girls as boys. The ruling expanded the Education Department\u2019s Title IX mandate to treat male and female college athletes the same.\n\nPaez was elevated from the federal district court in Los Angeles to the appeals court in 1999. Clinton had appointed Paez to the district court five years earlier after Paez spent 13 years as a state judge in California. Before he became a judge, Paez worked as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, Western Center on Law and Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance.\n\nHe wrote the majority opinion in 2011 that Arizona lawmakers went too far when they enacted strict immigration regulations, including making it a state crime to lack immigration papers. The Supreme Court later ruled similarly.\n\nThis is the White House's second effort to impose a travel ban. An order issued a week after Trump took office also was quickly blocked from taking effect. Nationwide protests were held in many cities and airports.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-05-09", "type": "article"}
