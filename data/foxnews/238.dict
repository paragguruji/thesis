Presidents from other schools issued scathing attacks of the move.\n\nMany students and scholars from countries affected by the ban have been caught in legal limbo while traveling abroad.\n\nIranian Yale University doctoral student Ali Abdi left the U.S. days before the order was signed to conduct research in Afghanistan. Now he doesn't know if he can return.\n\nOther schools with students or faculty who were stranded include MIT, Harvard and Clark Atlanta University.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
