The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco all sided against the order.\n\n3-0 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017\n\nConway responded to Clinton's tweet, \u201cPA, WI, MI\u201d -- an obvious dig at Clinton for losing the must-win states during the election.\n\nPA, WI, MI. https://t.co/wqhYCU2qe2 \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 10, 2017\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee also had tweeted earlier in the week to support Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren after she was reprimanded for her criticism on the Senate floor about now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nConway, meanwhile, has been using Twitter of late to confront the Clintons. Last week, Conway rapped Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, who criticized her for referencing the \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d after a stabbing outside the Louvre Museum in Paris. There was no massacre, and Conway was attacked for the reference.\n\n\u201cVery grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack\u2026or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don\u2019t make up attacks,\u201d Chelsea tweeted.\n\nConway responded, \u201cBosnia lie a Great reminder. And 2 @CheleaClinton & others, you can\u2019t 'invent' quality candidates either. I misspoke; you lost the election.\u201d\n\n", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
