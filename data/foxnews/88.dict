But lawyers for the administration said in the filing that a ban that focuses solely on foreigners who have never entered the U.S. \u2014 instead of green card holders already in the U.S. or who have traveled abroad and want to return \u2014 would pose no legal difficulties.\n\n\"In so doing, the president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation,\" the filing said.\n\nTrump said at the news conference that a new order would come next week.\n\n\"I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country,\" he said.\n\nLegal experts said a new order focusing only on residents of the seven countries who had never entered the U.S. would still face legal hurdles over possible religious discrimination.\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, believes Trump would eliminate some major problems with the new focus.\n\n\"But I think that it will definitely still end up in court,\" she said.\n\nStephen Vladeck, who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law, said the states challenging the current ban \u2014 Washington and Minnesota \u2014 would likely change their lawsuit to focus on any revised order.\n\n\"It will surely be a mess \u2014 and perhaps a repeat of some of the chaos we saw the first weekend of the original order,\" Vladeck wrote in an email.\n\nThe administration asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to hold off on making any more decisions related to the lawsuit until the new order is issued, and then toss out last week's decision by a three-judge 9th Circuit panel that kept the ban on hold.\n\nThe 9th Circuit said late Thursday it will hold off on deciding whether to have a larger panel of judges reconsider that ruling.\n\nThe appeals court had asked the Trump administration and Washington and Minnesota to file arguments on whether a larger panel should rehear the case.\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said the federal government was \"conceding defeat\" by saying it does not want a larger appellate panel to review last week's ruling. The three judges who issued that decision rejected the Trump administration's claim of presidential authority and questioned its motives in ordering the ban.\n\nThe administration attacked the decision in Thursday's court filing, saying the panel wrongly suggested some foreigners may be entitled to constitutional protections. The filing also rejected the judges' determination that courts could consider Trump's statements about shutting down Muslim immigration.\n\nThe lawsuit says the ban unconstitutionally blocks entry to the U.S. on the basis of religion and harms residents, universities and sales tax revenue in the two states. Eighteen other states, including California and New York, have supported the challenge.\n\nIn his filing with the 9th Circuit Thursday, Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell said the ruling by the three-judge panel was consistent with previous U.S. Supreme Court decisions, so there was no basis for a review.\n\nPurcell said Trump had campaigned on the promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and one week into office issued the order that \"radically changed immigration policy\" and \"unleashed chaos around the world.\"\n\nThe three-judge panel said the states had raised \"serious\" allegations that the ban targets Muslims, and it rejected the federal government's argument that courts do not have the authority to review the president's immigration and national security decisions.\n\nThe three judges said the Trump administration presented no evidence that any foreigner from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 was responsible for a terrorist attack in the U.S.\n\nIn Thursday's filing, the administration said the ban was intended to prevent potential attacks from \"nationals of seven countries that were previously found to present uniquely high risks of terrorism.\"\n\nThe ban does not discriminate on the basis of religion because it affects only a fraction of the world's Muslim population and also applies to non-Muslims in those countries, the administration said.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
