The Justice Department is appealing the order.\n\n\"I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power,\" Sessions said Tuesday in an interview with radio host Mark Levin.\n\nSens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz slammed Sessions' remarks in Twitter posts.\n\nHey Jeff Sessions, this #IslandinthePacific has been the 50th state for going on 58 years. And we won\u2019t succumb to your dog whistle politics \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) April 20, 2017\n\nHawaii was built on the strength of diversity & immigrant experiences- including my own. Jeff Sessions\u2019 comments are ignorant & dangerous \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) April 20, 2017\n\nMr. Attorney General: You voted for that judge. And that island is called Oahu. It's my home. Have some respect. https://t.co/sW9z3vqBqG \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) April 20, 2017\n\nWhen asked about the comment on Fox News' \"The First 100 Days,\" Sessions said Hawaii was \"a beautiful island\" before adding, \"We\u2019ve got about 800 federal judges. One, protected perhaps by the 9th Circuit [Court of Appeals] has stopped an executive order by the President of the United States that I believe is constitutional and that I believe is explicitly approved by statutory law, so the process will go forward [and] appeals will be held.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-04-20", "type": "article"}
