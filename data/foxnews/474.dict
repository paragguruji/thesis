To not respond to evil with evil. To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. A Christian would never say 'you will pay for that.' Never. That is not a Christian gesture. An offense you overcome with forgiveness. To live in peace with everyone.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
