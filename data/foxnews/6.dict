The administration has not yet said what steps it will take next to try to implement the policy.\n\nThe poll asked voters to choose between two descriptions of the executive order: 56 percent think it\u2019s better described as a \u201crestriction on people entering the United States from known terrorist hot spots.\u201d Some 37 percent say \u201ca Muslim ban\u201d is more accurate.\n\nMeanwhile, by a 42-33 percent margin, voters think the travel ban makes the United States safer rather than less safe. About one-quarter say it doesn\u2019t make much difference (24 percent).\n\nDonald Trump voters are more likely to say the ban makes the country safer by an 81-point margin (84-3 percent), and fully 92 percent of them approve of the overall travel ban.\n\nOnly seven percent of those who supported Hillary Clinton approve of the ban, and they think it makes the country \u201cless safe\u201d by a 55-point margin (62-7 percent).\n\nPollpourri\n\nPresident Trump spoke about the depletion of the U.S. military in his inaugural address. Voters agree.\n\nThe poll finds that 58 percent think the military is \u201cstretched too thin,\u201d and a 45-percent plurality feels it is underfunded. Twenty-five percent think the federal government spends too much on the military, while another 25 percent think it spends the right amount.\n\nIn addition, voters are nearly three times as likely to say the military has gotten weaker rather than stronger over the last eight years (41 vs. 15 percent). Among veterans, 56 percent say it has gotten weaker.\n\nThe partisan divide is wide. Republicans (77 percent) are nearly twice as likely Democrats (40 percent) to say the military is stretched too thin, and more than nine times as likely to think it has gotten weaker over the last eight years (74 percent and 8 percent respectively). And on funding priorities, 66 percent of Republicans think the government spends too little on the military, while just 25 percent of Democrats say the same.\n\nThe Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.", "source": "Fox Business", "publish_date": "2017-02-14", "type": "article"}
