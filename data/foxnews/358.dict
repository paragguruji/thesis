Even if the 4th Circuit approves the administration's request, it would remain blocked by the Hawaii ruling.\n\nThe attorney generals criticizing the travel ban are from: Virginia, Maryland, California, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, North Carolina, Illinois, Rhode Island, Iowa, Vermont, Maine, Washington, Massachusetts, New Mexico and the District of Columbia.", "source": "Fox News", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "type": "article"}
