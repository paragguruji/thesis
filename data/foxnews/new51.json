Trump is not politically correct at all. (If he wanted to) he would say outright that it was a Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nRaza has come out in support of the 120-day suspension of the refugee program and a 90-day moratorium on travel to the U.S. from citizens of seven terror hot spots, including Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. She said every country has a right to secure its borders, and that the temporary order is needed while Washington works on a better solution to combat extremism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of [Trump\u2019s] terminology but he\u2019s bringing a necessary conversation to the table,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may not like talking about these issues, but you don\u2019t have to like Trump to have this discussion.\n\nExpand / Contract Hundreds of people rally against a temporary travel ban signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in an executive order during a protest at Detroit Metropolitan airport in Romulus, Michigan, U.S., January 29, 2017.

I hope we begin to engage reformist Muslims. We need to stop with identity politics.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more pro-Muslim than vetting jihadists,\u201d Jasser added.\n\nThe executive order was signed Friday and took immediate effect, and affects travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order also suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria.\n\n\"Such selective and discriminatory acts will only serve to embolden the radical narratives of extremists and will provide further fuel to the advocates of violence and terrorism at a critical time,\" the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world's largest body of Islamic nations, said in a statement \"The OIC calls upon the United States government to reconsider this blanket decision and maintain its moral obligation to provide leadership and hope at a time of great uncertainty and unrest in the world.\"\n\nTrump has vigorously defended the order, saying it \"is about terror and keeping our country safe\" and not \"a Muslim ban.\"\n\nThousands of people spent the past weekend protesting the order at many of the nation\u2019s airports, including New York\u2019s JFK, Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and LAX in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Monday, CAIR announced it filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of over 20 individuals that challenges the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cThe vulgar animosity that accounts for the existence of Executive Order entitled \u2018Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals, issued the same day of this action, is plain to see, and the absence of the words Islam or Muslim does nothing to obscure it,\u201d reads a line from the lawsuit that was filed in the Eastern District Court of Virginia.\n\nAs of Monday, protests have continued at airports around the nation.\n\n\u201cTo the people protesting \u2013 you feel for these people, that\u2019s great. So do I,\u201d Raza said. \u201cBut where were you a month ago, three months ago, a year ago?\n\n\u201cProtesters are yelling in the streets over a few hundred refugees detained \u2013 but they were not shouting in the streets when half a million Syrians were being butchered?\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "foxnews", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "extreme", "trump", "activists", "vetting", "refugees", "muslimamerican", "president", "trumps", "lawsuit", "order", "muslim", "islamic"], "summary": "Not all Muslim-Americans reject President Trump's executive order restricting travel from seven troubled, Muslim-majority nations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a ban on Islam, or any religion,\u201d Raheel Raza, a Pakistani-born Muslim human rights activist, told Fox News.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of [Trump\u2019s] terminology but he\u2019s bringing a necessary conversation to the table,\u201d she said.\nThe executive order was signed Friday and took immediate effect, and affects travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\nOn Monday, CAIR announced it filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of over 20 individuals that challenges the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s executive order."}
