How old they\u2019ve gotten, and how I missed those creases and the layers of skin over skin on their faces,\u201d Edalat, 42, said. \u201cIt bombards you on a daily basis when you\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nFor many Iranian immigrants and their families, the 7,500-mile journey between Tehran and California is an emotionally fraught necessity. Most Iranians in the U.S. oppose the hard-line regime in Tehran. Many fled for political freedoms or opportunities for professional growth. Others moved here for a Western education and planned to go back, but found themselves tethered to America after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nThe Casablanca that is \"Tehrangeles\" has long been a hotbed of political intrigue, turning heavily Iranian neighborhoods such as Westwood and Beverly Hills into key locations for gathering intelligence on Tehran. Both the CIA and the FBI have spent decades recruiting informants and sources among Iranian expatriates and businessmen who travel to Iran.\n\nStill, the community\u2019s roots, culture and family are in Iran, and the tug of the motherland, steeped in memories, pulls hard. Although it has never been easy or inexpensive to make the journey, until last week, it was manageable.\n\nNow, on the heels of President Trump \u2019s executive order, many Iranian immigrants are wondering how feasible it will be to continue the tradition. Trump\u2019s action blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for at least 90 days. It also imposes a ban for 120 days on refugees from any country entering the U.S. and bars refugees from Syria indefinitely, in a move the president has said will better protect the country against terrorist attacks.\n\nA federal judge is\u00adsued a tem\u00adpor\u00adary re\u00adstrain\u00ading or\u00adder against Trump\u2019s im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion re\u00adstric\u00adtions on Fri\u00adday, and signaled that the or\u00adder ap\u00adplies to cases across the coun\u00adtry. The Department of Homeland Security suspended \"any and all actions\" related to the ban in response, but the White House has said it will ask for an emergency stay of the judge's order.\n\nAlso Friday, Trump imposed sanctions on Iran, delivering on his promise to take a harder line with the volatile U.S. foe.\n\nThe sanctions, on 13 people and 12 companies, came a day after he put Iran \u201con notice\u201d for testing a medium-range ballistic missile and for attacks by Iran-funded Houthi militants on a Saudi frigate.\n\nIran has instituted a tit-for-tat policy in response to Trump\u2019s ban, barring Americans from receiving visas. Although dual nationals can still fly to Tehran, they wonder whether they will be caught in a political tug-of-war, harassed because they came from the U.S.\n\nEdalat worries he won\u2019t see his family for months. His mother had planned to visit the family in West Hills this month. The chemical engineer doesn\u2019t know whether he should tell her to stay in Iran, or ask her to try her luck and fly out next weekend.\n\n\u201cShe is devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe damage is already done...you\u2019re accusing a 65-year-old woman who hasn\u2019t hurt an insect in her life of being a threat to the national security of this country.\u201d\n\nThe ban is particularly dispiriting because it comes just one year after the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, said Saman Djabbari, a first-generation American whose parents moved to Los Angeles from Iran.\n\n\u201cThere was such hope with that. It seems like there was one giant step forward and two giant steps backward,\u201d Djabbari, 30, said. \u201cThere was all this progress made. That thaw, who knows what happens with it now? Is it just frozen over again?\u201d\n\nHis uncle still lives in Iran, he said, and the only chance the family has of seeing him now is flying there. Even that has its difficulties, Djabbari said.\n\n\u201cLast time I went there I was 15 years old and the Iranian government for some reason had this idea that I never left the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that entire trip, my mom and her brother had to produce all this evidence that I was living in the States the whole time. I could have gotten stuck over there.\u201d\n\nExperts note that existing vetting policies were already rigorous.\n\n\u201cCould we do more? Yeah, we could send out FBI agents,\u201d said Niels Frenzen, an expert in immigration and refugee law at USC. \u201cWhen money isn\u2019t an issue, one can always do more.\u201d\n\nStill, the ban is \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201cconfusing,\u201d Frenzen added.\n\n\u201cIt is stopping people who have been vetted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country selection process is a political decision and has nothing to do as far as I can tell with national security.\u201d\n\nMahsa Pashaei left Iran about five years ago after her family won the green-card lottery. She admits the immigration process was easier for them because of that, but the ban ruined her family\u2019s future plans.\n\nPashaei, a student at UCLA, said her mother planned to travel to Iran for Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in March.\n\n\u201cAll these decisions are on hold,\u201d Pashaei said in Farsi. \u201cMy family is worried we will never see each other again.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old said she feels caught between two countries.\n\n\u201cNeither accepts you,\u201d she said. \u201cEach moment, you wonder \u2018If something happens, which country would want to help me? Which way do I reach out?\u2019 That\u2019s its own horror.\u201d\n\nIt took 14 months for Edalat\u2019s mother to get through the vetting process, which included criminal background checks, flights to the U.S. Embassy in Armenia, presenting original copies of Iranian birth certificates and showing proof of income, among other steps.\n\nHis wife Samah\u2019s aunt received a visa and planned to visit in March. The aunt, 70, traveled twice to the embassy in Austria for her visa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone with my mother, and she says my aunt has been crying over this,\u201d Samah Edalat said as she fed their daughter, Nava, in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou want to revoke this privilege -- and I agree it is a privilege for noncitizens -- at least be accountable,\u201d her husband added. \u201cPeople spent money, they invested their emotions and their time.\u201d\n\nEdalat\u2019s mother paid for the family\u2019s plane tickets during their December visit. With two children, he and his wife couldn\u2019t spare $5,000 to fly to Tehran. It was money they could use for preschool.\n\nWith the ban in place, he doesn\u2019t know when he will see his loved ones, or visit a country where a song or bite of food can cause a flood of memories.\n\n\u201cI met my nephew for the first time this trip. I\u2019m not going to be there when he\u2019s 10, or 5, or 6,\u201d Edalat said. \u201cYear after year, my mother\u2019s birthday, my brother\u2019s birthday, my nephew\u2019s birthday. All of these things are missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey come back haunting you, all of these sacrifices you\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nsarah.parvini@latimes.com\n\nFor more California news follow me on Twitter: @sarahparvini", "authors": ["Sarah Parvini"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "latimes", "top_words": ["tehran", "iran", "motherland", "mother", "trump", "complicated", "ban", "family", "political", "visit", "iranian", "country", "tricky", "americans", "trip", "planned"], "summary": "Both the CIA and the FBI have spent decades recruiting informants and sources among Iranian expatriates and businessmen who travel to Iran.\nStill, the community\u2019s roots, culture and family are in Iran, and the tug of the motherland, steeped in memories, pulls hard.\nNow, on the heels of President Trump \u2019s executive order, many Iranian immigrants are wondering how feasible it will be to continue the tradition.\nHis mother had planned to visit the family in West Hills this month.\nPashaei, a student at UCLA, said her mother planned to travel to Iran for Nowruz, the Persian New Year, in March."}
