Here are some story lines I don\u2019t want you to miss today.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTravel Ban in Court: Get Your Ringside Seat\n\nBefore President Trump even took the oath, legal observers figured the federal courts would check his executive power, but few expected the first clash would come less than three weeks in. An appeals court in San Francisco will hold a hearing this afternoon regarding Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 which you can follow live on latimes.com \u2014 after it received filings from federal government lawyers versus those of more than a dozen states, nearly 100 businesses and a number of former security and intelligence officials. (Read the documents here.) And don\u2019t blink, because it could end up in the Supreme Court later this week. Will the judges take Trump\u2019s many tweets on the subject into account too?\n\n@realDonaldTrump, Meet @LATstevelopez. Can You Match Wits?\n\nSpeaking of those missives of 140 characters or less \u2026 They have the power to shape international relations, move the stock market and stir public sentiment for or against Trump.

Gen Xavier Becerra says he\u2019s ready to battle back if necessary. Meanwhile, California\u2019s House Republicans have a suggestion for where the president could save some money: They\u2019ve asked the administration to block a $650-million federal grant for the state\u2019s bullet train project until an audit of the project\u2019s finances is completed.\n\nDeVos Faces Her Biggest Test\n\nOf all Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, Betsy DeVos has faced the hardest path to confirmation. Phone calls have poured into Congress against her, two GOP senators defected, and Democrats held a last-ditch, 24-hour debate to sink her chances. And there was that comment about guns in schools and grizzly bears. Even so, DeVos will probably squeak by when the vote comes today.\n\nThe Pain of Sandy Hook, Made Even Worse\n\nImagine the pain of losing a child \u2014 and then being tormented by strangers denying it ever happened.

Here\u2019s how California is preparing for that new reality.\n\n-- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman pleaded guilty to wrong-way driving on the 5 Freeway, thus avoiding jail time.\n\nHOLLYWOOD AND THE ARTS\n\n-- Was Lady Gaga\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show political? Or not political enough? (Let\u2019s face it, she shilled for Tiffany & Co.) Four arguments for the former.\n\n-- Two-time Tony winner Al Pacino will portray playwright Tennessee Williams in \u201cGod Looked Away\u201d at the Pasadena Playhouse. It\u2019s a work-in-progress opening Wednesday.\n\n-- Inside the Oscar nominees luncheon, where the clarion call was \u201cart has no borders.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
