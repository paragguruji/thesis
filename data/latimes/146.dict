Both rulings mean that travelers from the seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 are allowed to come into the U.S. while the lawsuit is adjudicated.\n\nSpeaking at a White House news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump said he would \u201cdo whatever is necessary to keep our country safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country.
