We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the White House decides.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he\u2019s considering a new, more tailored executive order, and a White House official said Sunday the administration is still weighing how to respond to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to uphold a stay on the ban to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court said on Friday it wants the executive branch to decide within 14 days.\n\nI\u2019m Sarah Wire. Welcome to the Monday edition of Essential Politics.\n\nTrump has rushed to fulfill campaign promises in his first three weeks, occasionally sacrificing clarity and depth for speed, and David Lauter kicks off the fourth week with a look at how Trump has lost significant ground in public approval since taking office.\n\nNoah Bierman and Brian Bennett have a look at the adjustments Trump could potentially make to his style and team.\n\nGet the latest about the Trump administration on Essential Washington, follow @latimespolitics and keep an eye on our Essential Politics news feed\n\nNO WORD ON CONFIDENCE IN FLYNN\n\nDuring interviews on several of the Sunday morning news shows, Trump\u2019s senior policy advisor Stephen Miller wouldn\u2019t say if the president still has confidence in his national security advisor, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, following news that Flynn may have tipped off the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions put in place by the Obama administration before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nFlynn reportedly mischaracterized the conversations to Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials and the FBI has been examining Flynn\u2019s contact with the ambassador, according to multiple news reports. Democrats are demanding answers about the potentially illegal conversations, saying Flynn should be suspended or fired.\n\nMiller also continued to assert a widely debunked claim that massive vote fraud helped deprive the president of a popular-vote victory in November\u2019s election.\n\nIMMIGRATION RAIDS\n\nState and federal Democrats said they were dismayed by the lack of clear information from immigration officials after a series of recent raids that authorities called routine, but have rattled advocates for immigrants.\n\nCalifornia Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) is demanding more information and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called news of the raids alarming.\n\n23 CANDIDATES FOR THE 34th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nYup, you read that right. A total of 23 candidates filed papers to run in the race to replace Xavier Becerra in the 34th Congressional District. The filing deadline was Thursday, and a final certified list of candidates is expected to be released Wednesday. Need a refresher on who\u2019s who? Christine Mai-Duc has you covered here.\n\nIn other 34th District news, Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez was endorsed last week by Planned Parenthood\u2019s advocacy arm. He also held a campaign kickoff event over the weekend, where L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti stumped for him.\n\nREBUILDING CALIFORNIA\u2019S ROADS\n\nDirector of the advocacy group Transportation California Will Kempton said he is \u201cfrustrated and disappointed\u201d that California has failed for decades to agree on a plan to pay for a $136-billion backlog of repairs to state highways and local roads. Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders said they will take another crack at a deal during the next two months.\n\nPatrick McGreevy spoke with Kempton ahead of his retirement from his 40-year career working on the Golden State\u2019s transportation needs.\n\nPODCAST: DECONSTRUCTING THE DEFUNDING THREAT", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "authors": "Sarah D.
