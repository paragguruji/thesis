Accepting the award onstage, he delivered one of the night\u2019s most powerful speeches.\n\n\u201cAt this time, many Iranians all over the world are watching us and I imagine them to be very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are happy not just because of an important award or a film or filmmaker, but because at the time when talk of war, intimidation and aggression is exchanged between politicians, the name of their country Iran is spoken here through her glorious culture, a rich and ancient culture that has been hidden under the heavy dust of politics. I proudly offer this award to the people of my country, a people who respect all cultures and civilizations and despise hostility and resentment.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if other prominent Hollywood figures will join Alidoosti in boycotting the Feb. 26 ceremony, to be held at the Dolby Theatre.\n\nLate Friday night, president of the National Iranian-American Council Trita Parsi told The Times that Farhadi has only an Iranian passport, which would leave him subject to the ban unless he applied and was granted an artistic exception.\n\n\u201cThe law is very clear and I\u2019ve heard confirmation that he is not coming,\u201d Parsi said. \u201cI find it unlikely that they would be able to [make an exception for Farhadi] \u2013 and that is assuming the Trump administration would want to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the academy has made a concerted effort in the past few years to become a more global organization. Of last year's class of invitees, more than 40% were from outside the U.S., including \u201cWadjda\u201d filmmaker Haifaa al-Mansour, Saudi Arabia's first female director.\n\nAsked last month to comment on the academy\u2019s push toward inclusiveness in light of the election of Donald Trump, academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs told The Times, \"That question is very interesting \u2013 \u2018What kind of country are we?\u2019 \u2013 and I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re really wrestling with here, with a couple of very different views of what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the academy, I would say that we know who we are.\"\n\nTimes staff writer Josh Rottenberg contributed to this report.\n\nCAPTION L.A.
