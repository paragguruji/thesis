{"title": "Travel leaders say Trump's budget would kill program that promotes trips to the U.S.", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-brand-usa-20170523-story.html", "text": "Donald Trump the businessman was a big fan of marketing and brand building, but Trump the president has produced a budget that doesn\u2019t support tourism marketing \u2014 and that has the travel industry fuming.\n\nTravel industry leaders are protesting a proposal in Trump\u2019s budget, which was released Tuesday, that would cut funding to a program intended to attract more international visitors to the U.S.\n\nBrand USA, a promotional tourism campaign launched in 2011, is funded by private donations and fees charged to international visitors who register for visas to enter the U.S. The Trump budget would divert the fees to pay for increased border protection.\n\n\u201cWith all that\u2019s going on in the world, unilaterally disarming the marketing of the U.S. as a travel destination would be to surrender market share at the worst possible time,\u201d said Roger Dow, chief executive of the U.S. Travel Assn., a trade group.\n\nBrand USA is the first coordinated campaign to promote the United States as a travel destination, relying on billboards, newspaper and magazine ads, radio spots and an anthem by singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash.\n\nA study commissioned by Brand USA said the campaign helped draw 4.3 million new visitors to the U.S. and generated $29.5 billion in additional spending over the last four years.\n\n\u201cWith travel season upon us, it is important for lawmakers to understand the benefits of this program,\u201d said Katherine Lugar, chief executive of the American Hotel & Lodging Assn. \u201cWe need Brand USA\u2019s strong marketing message to remind visitors that the U.S. is open for business.\u201d\n\nUnder the program\u2019s bylaws, private donations must generate at least $100 million a year toward the program before the campaign can receive the $14 fee paid by each international visitor who applies for a visa.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal for the next fiscal year calls for the fee to be used to help fund U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe fees are expected to generate $162 million in the next fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that diverting the fee away from Brand USA would increase the budget deficit by $510 million from 2018 to 2022 because, industry officials assume, taxes generated by international travel would be lost.\n\nAccording to the Trump budget proposal, the increase in funding for border security will \u201cprovide additional resources for a southern border wall, expanded detention capacity, and initiatives to reduce violent crime, as well as more immigration judges, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and Border Patrol agents.\u201d\n\nThe funding shift comes as travel industry leaders worry that other Trump proposals \u2014 a travel ban from several Middle Eastern and African countries and a wall along the southern border \u2014 have sent a message that the U.S. does not welcome foreign visitors.\n\nThe U.S. travel industry generates an estimated $2.3 trillion in economic spending and supports 15.3 million jobs.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
