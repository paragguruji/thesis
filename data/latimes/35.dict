"Immigration and refugee advocates expressed disappointment Monday with the Supreme Court\u2019s partial reinstatement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying even limited implementation could cause hardship to refugees and others seeking to travel to the United States from six affected Muslim-majority countries.\n\nHowever, organizations taking part in the months-long legal fight against the revised travel ban expressed hopes that the high court ultimately will reject the restrictions after arguments are heard in October.\n\nAnd they welcomed what they described as an implicit rebuke of the White House\u2019s assertion that Trump has unfettered powers to exclude arrivals based on purported national security concerns.\n\nThe initial rollout of the ban, days after Trump took office in January, caused pandemonium at airports across the United States and overseas as tens of thousands of visa-holders arriving from seven affected countries were turned away without warning or detained.\n\nAfter courts blocked that order, Trump issued a revised travel ban that took Iraq off the list.\n\nA replay of January\u2019s travel chaos was unlikely Monday because the court\u2019s action will allow visa-holders with \u201cbona fide\u201d ties to people or entities in the U.S. to enter, meaning students, employees and family members can still get in.\n\nBut refugee advocates said the court's limited ruling, which the administration can move to implement on Thursday, could leave many would-be arrivals in limbo pending the finalizing of new vetting procedures.\n\nThe administration had originally said a three-month travel ban was needed in part to review the checks to which would-be entrants are subjected.\n\nDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, said the partial reinstatement of the ban particularly threatens \u201cvulnerable people waiting to come to the U.S.,\u201d including those with urgent medical conditions.\n\n\u201cWe urge the administration to begin its long-delayed review of the vetting process and restart a program which changes lives for the better,\u201d said Miliband.\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups that challenged the ban, said that as of this week, approximately 50,500 refugees from the six affected countries had been approved for travel and resettlement in the United States \u2014 all having already undergone intensive checks.\n\nThe Middle East Studies Assn., one the groups contesting the ban in the lower courts, said many students and academics were ensnared by the original order.\n\nEven though Monday\u2019s court move should allow entry to those studying or working at American academic institutions, many from the affected countries remained wary of leaving and then attempting to reenter the United States, the group said.\n\nIran \u2014 along with Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya \u2014 is one of the affected countries, and Southern California is home to a large Iranian American community that was hit hard by the original ban.\n\nSome advocates said even with Monday\u2019s limited action, there has already been a chilling effect on movement.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court decision immediately places the status of many Americans\u2019 families into question again,\u201d said Shayan Modarres, legal counsel for the National Iranian American Council.\n\nThe group said that visas issued to Iranian passport-holders had fallen by nearly half since the legal battle over the ban began, and that obtaining a U.S. visa was becoming so onerous that many would not even try to get one.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s new idea is to make it so hard on Iranians and Muslims to get a visa that visa officers will have the unrestricted discretion to reject visa applications,\u201d Modarres said.\n\nHe added that grounds for rejection could be social media postings critical of Trump or not being able to produce airline boarding passes that could have been issued and used more than a decade ago.\n\nAdvocacy groups reiterated their position \u2014 which was argued in a number of the lower court cases that propelled the issue to the high court \u2014 that the travel restrictions run counter to core American traditions and values.\n\nMark Hetfield, president of the refugee resettlement agency HIAS, said the group considered the court\u2019s move \u201can affirmation that the president does not have unfettered, unchecked authority to bar refugees from the U.S. without evidence to justify such action.\u201d\n\nBut he added that the executive order\u2019s partial resurrection would \u201conce again cause irreparable damage to refugees, immigrants and America's reputation as a welcoming country.\"\n\nThe initial ban prompted large nationwide protests, and advocates suggested they would again seek to marshal popular opposition to the restrictions.\n\n\u201cWhen the first order went into effect, tens of thousands of Americans showed the world that this is not who we are and not what we want,\u201d said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, another of the groups involved in the legal challenge. \u201cWe will never give up defending the rights of those who are affected by this discriminatory executive order.\u201d", "source":
