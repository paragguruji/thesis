It is unclear how many people were deported before the orders were issued. It is also unclear if the Trump administration has fully complied with those orders.\n\nIn addition to the people who arrived in the U.S. and were detained, as of 3 p.m. on Saturday, an additional 173 travelers from the listed countries had been stopped from boarding flights to the U.S., a Homeland Security official said in a statement.\n\nThe department did not make an official available to describe the actions and the agency's response.\n\nAs many as 3,250 travelers may have been \"inconvenienced\" by the new visa restrictions, officials for the department said in a statement Sunday.\n\n\"Yesterday, less than 1% of the more than 325,000 international air travelers who arrive every day were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented,\" the statement read.\n\nThe department will comply with court orders, the statement said. But no evidence was given to confirm this. Lawyers seeking to meet with detainees at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington and at San Francisco have said that they were blocked by officials on Sunday.\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders, faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump\u2019s executive orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people,\" according to the department's statement.\n\nAll of the visa holders and travelers from the listed countries blocked from entering the U.S. since Friday already had gone through multiple steps of security screening that checked their biographical information and travel history against U.S. terrorism databases.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
