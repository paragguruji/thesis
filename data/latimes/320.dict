A revised White House statement later omitted the word \u201coutrageous,\u201d but repeated the president\u2019s view that the executive order signed Jan. 27 \u201cprotecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States\u201d was within the law.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it had suspended \u201cany and all actions\u201d related to the travel ban.\n\n\u201cDHS personnel will resume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure,\u201d the department\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe judge\u2019s order Friday came in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of Washington and joined by Minnesota. The suit argued that the president\u2019s moves had amounted to religious discrimination against Muslims in violation of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge did not address the substance of those legal arguments, but suggested in court that the states had a good chance of winning the case.\n\n\u201cThe law is a powerful thing. It has the ability to hold everyone accountable to it, and that includes the president of the United States,\u201d Washington state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson said at a news conference.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision goes further than a ruling earlier this week from a Los Angeles federal judge that also ordered a temporary halt to Trump\u2019s immigration ban. This one orders a temporary stop to nearly every major portion of the administration\u2019s order, including the 120-day ban on all refugee admissions, indefinite suspension of the admission of Syrian refugees and preference for refugees who are members of persecuted religious minorities.\n\nAlso affected is a blanket, 90-day block on admission of citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful day for the rule of law in our country,\u201d said Washington state\u2019s solicitor general, Noah Purcell, who argued the case. \u201cThe order was haphazardly carried out and poorly thought up.\u201d\n\nActivist groups that have been running legal aid operations at airports and operating hotlines for immigrants already were celebrating.\n\n\u201cAirport officials have informed us that Customs and Border Protection has been told to not implement the executive order at JFK,\u201d said Camille Mackler, an attorney at the New York Immigration Coalition who has been part of a group of lawyers stationed at John F. Kennedy airport all week.\n\n\u201cThis is a win. It\u2019s an affirmation that these orders are not necessarily enforceable and not necessarily legal, and not a representation of this country and its values,\u201d she said.\n\nOfficials at Los Angeles International Airport already had relaxed security procedures after an L.A. federal judge\u2019s order earlier this week temporarily suspended Trump\u2019s travel ban on immigrants from the seven countries who had visas.\n\nThe administration said it would seek a review of the Seattle judge\u2019s order. \u201cAt the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people.\u201d\n\nThe decision came as a Justice Department lawyer, addressing a hearing Friday on another challenge to the travel ban in Virginia, revealed that 100,000 visas had been revoked following the executive order \u2014 a figure the State Department later estimated at closer to 60,000.\n\nPresumably, the court\u2019s order would require most or all of those visas to be reinstated.\n\nAlready Friday night, a European airline in Iran reported that it was allowing any traveler with a valid visa to board its U.S.-bound flights. Most travelers from Tehran earlier in the day had been blocked unless they held a green card.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters who swelled airport parking lots and international arrival terminals this week have seen the executive order as an attempt to associate Muslims with terrorism and bar them from the country.\n\nThe order caused confusion at airports around the country, as holders of green cards and visas from the affected countries who were en route to the U.S. this week were detained in airports for hours and sometimes deported upon arrival or not allowed onto flights traveling to the U.S.\n\nAfter civil rights groups filed lawsuits on behalf of those who had green cards designating them as permanent legal residents, the Trump administration relented and clarified that green card holders would be exempt from the travel ban. Government officials also reversed a prior position this week and said that dual citizens who were from one of the restricted nations and another nation not on the list would be exempt.\n\nWith the Seattle judge\u2019s order \u2014 which followed several other more limited rulings around the country \u2014 one of the new administration\u2019s most significant initiatives appears to be in peril.\n\n\u201cThis new order, even if temporary, seems to go beyond the other lawsuits,\u201d said Margo Schlanger, a University of Michigan law professor who was formerly a civil rights attorney at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cThe states got everything they asked for,\u201d said Schlanger, who has tracked dozens of lawsuits against the president\u2019s travel ban. She said the case could pave the way for an eventual ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem , Rick Anderson, Ramin Mostaghim", "type": "article"}
