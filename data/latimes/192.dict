{"title": "Did Gorsuch subtweet Trump on the role of the courts?", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-gorsuch-trump-20170605-story.html", "text": "Not content with politicizing a terrorist attack against one of America\u2019s closest allies, the tweeter-in-chief is now making life difficult for the lawyers who may have to defend his revised executive order on immigration before the Supreme Court.\n\nAt 6:29 a.m. Monday, President Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C..\u201d Eight minutes later, he added: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\u201d\n\nThese evidently unlawyered ejaculations followed a tweet over the weekend in which Trump linked the need for the \u201cTravel Ban\u201d \u2013 terminology his press secretary has foresworn \u2013 to Saturday\u2019s terrorist attack in London.\n\n\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough,\u201d the president tweeted as reports of the violence were coming in. \u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nAs Garrett Epps noted in the Atlantic, Trump had undermined the arguments of his own acting solicitor general, including the assertion that the revised order represents the president\u2019s own considered judgment about the needs of national security and is not a Muslim ban or a ban of any kind. Epps added: \u201cIt is more dangerous to be Donald Trump\u2019s friend than his enemy.\u201d\n\nMore doubtful is the suggestion that by trying to pressure the federal courts, Trump has jeopardized their independence. The Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal legal think tank, sounded this alarm Monday, warning that Trump\u2019s \u201ctroubling pattern of attacking judges and the courts for rulings he disagrees with . . . threatens our entire system of government.\u201d\n\nIf anything, I suspect that Trump\u2019s tweets have stiffened the spine of the judiciary, including members of the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Friday, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s own appointee, addressed an audience at Harvard and celebrated the fact that \u201cthe government can lose in its own courts and accept the judgment of those courts.\u201d In the terminology of Trump\u2019s favorite medium, Gorsuch may have been subtweeting the president.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Gorsuch will rule against Trump if the court takes up the issue of the executive order. But if he did, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a justice disappointed the president to whom he or she owed his position on the bench. Justice Elena Kagan, who was not only appointed by President Obama but served as his solicitor general, ruled against his administration on several occasions. (One of the silliest arguments of Democratic senators who opposed Gorsuch\u2019s nomination was that he might not be independent of Trump.)\n\nThe fact that judges are inured to Trump\u2019s tweets doesn\u2019t exonerate him for attacking \u201cso-called judges\u201d or claiming, as he did in a tweet on Monday, that the courts are \u201cslow and political.\u201d\n\nPresidential contempt for the courts can undermine public confidence in them. But Trump\u2019s tweets about the courts arguably have brought more contempt on himself.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
