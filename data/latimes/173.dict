I understand that the \"Maryland Voices and Commentary\" pages are not governed by any standard of ethics, but there should be some self-imposed honesty, you would think. First of all, 2.2 billion Muslims are free to come into the U.S. (Quite a \"Muslim ban,\" isn't it?) Only 10 percent of the worlds Muslim's are temporarily (a word almost never used in The Sun to describe the executive order) banned. (\"Another travel ban on standby,\" March 18) Just shameful. And, please, don't lie to us again by saying President Barack Obama's \"slow down\" of admittance of Iraqi refugees in 2011 was much better than a temporary ban. Hogwash !\n\nAnyone who reads Title 3, Section 301 of U.S. law and somehow thinks what Rudy Giuliani and Stephen Miller have to say on the matter is valid are true believers in a \"living\" Constitution. Forget the law, let's do what feels good (even if it's stupid).\n\nThe unfairness and the obvious ideology of \"open borders\" comes through daily in the once great Sun. Your unstated goal of socialism is getting closer daily.\n\nLyle Rescott, Marriottsville", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "authors": "Baltimore Sun", "type": "article"}
