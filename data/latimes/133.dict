Robart issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the order last week after concluding that a challenge by the states of Washington and Minnesota was likely to succeed.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Maura Dolan and Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
