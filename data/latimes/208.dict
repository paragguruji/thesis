Flights by U.S. commercial airlines also will continue.\n\nCarnival Corp., the big dog in the Caribbean cruise world, on Thursday released a statement to reassure its passengers ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe company said it was pleased the policy changes \u201cwill allow our ships to continue to sail to Cuba.\u201d\n\nKatharine Bonner, senior vice president of high-end tour operator Tauck, was careful to point out in a phone interview Friday that no changes will take effect until new regulations are written by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically saying If you\u2019ve already paid money for a cruise or trip, then you are OK,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nTauck, like other operators, will go ahead with two upcoming land tours to Cuba and a small-ship cruise in 2018. And, yes, they\u2019ve had calls from clients concerned about the planned changes.\n\nAmong cruise companies, Carnival expanded Cuba itineraries on several of its lines this spring. (It operates Carnival Cruises, Holland America Line, Seabourn, Princess Cruises and others.)\n\n\u201cWe will review the extent of the tightening of the travel rules, but our guests have already been traveling under the 12 approved forms of travel to Cuba \u2026,\u201d the company statement said.\n\nTechnically, travel to Cuba is illegal. But the U.S. government allows tourism that falls into 12 categories, including \u201cpeople to people\u201d cultural exchange tours, which cruises and tour operators currently follow.\n\nThat means organizing a \u201cfull schedule of educational exchange activities\u201d to comply with the rules, Bonner said. Under the proposed changes, however, individual travelers will no longer be allowed to use the people-to-people category.\n\nBut back to cruises. If you want to go, here are some expanded offerings by major lines in 2017 and beyond.\n\nCarnival Cruises started sailing to Cuba in June with four- and five-day voyages from Tampa, Fla., that include daytime and overnight stops in Cuba.\n\nRoyal Caribbean in May opened bookings for 58 cruises to Cuba between January 2018 and March 2019. It\u2019s offering four- and five-night sailings from Tampa, with an overnight stay in Havana, aboard the Empress of the Seas.\n\nHolland America Line also announced in May that it would begin cruises to Cuba in December aboard the Veendam. It plans to sail nine cruises, each seven days long, and stop at Havana and Cienfuegos, Cuba, as part of its Caribbean itineraries. It\u2019s also planning a 12-day Christmas holiday cruise leaving Dec. 22 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nALSO\n\nA look inside MSC's Meraviglia, the largest new cruise ship to sail in 2017\n\nBest summer camp at sea?
