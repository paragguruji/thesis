Two lines of airport police officers with helmets and batons stood nearby.\n\nAt 10 p.m., two people were arrested for blocking the roadway, according to LAX police Officer Rob Pedregon. The two were cited and released.\n\nLate Sunday, airport officials said police and demonstrators had brokered an agreement that allowed for upper and lower level roads to alternate being fully open for 30-minute periods. During each period, demonstrators could block one level for 15 minutes while the other level remained open.\n\nDemonstrators dispersed and upper- and lower-level roadways were fully open, with traffic flowing normally, LAX officials said in a 12:30 a.m. statement.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019ll be monitoring social media for any events that may come up,\u201d Pedregon said Monday morning.\n\nAirport officials said the agreement protected protesters\u2019 civil rights while allowing operations at one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports to continue.\n\nMotorist Rebekah Bergeron, 22, was sitting at the head of a line of cars blocked by the protesters. Though she said she didn't object to their demonstration, she also wanted to get home to Arizona.\n\n\"I have no problem if they want to protest this, but I just missed my flight,\" she said. \"I just watched it take off.\"\n\nAnother driver, Launita Walker, 51, of Lancaster, said she also supported the protesters\u2019 message but desperately needed to get to the home of her sick mother in the San Fernando Valley.\n\n\"I'm on their side all the way around but I need to get out of here,\" said a visibly exasperated Walker.\n\nAt one point, Assistant LAPD Chief Michel Moore used a megaphone to repeatedly ask the protesters to move to the sidewalk. He said he was not asking them to leave the airport but to simply clear the roadway in front of the Bradley terminal.\n\n\"We do not want to arrest you,\" he said.\n\nJennie Pasquarella, director of immigrant rights for the ACLU in California, said her advocacy group had filed habeas petitions on behalf of seven people who were detained at LAX on Saturday. Those seven were later released.\n\nThe ACLU filed an amended petition on Sunday asking a federal judge to order that all detainees obtain access to lawyers as well as phones. A judge could hear the petition on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nAlso Sunday, a federal judge issued an order instructing federal officials to transport an Iranian man back to the U.S. after he was deported from LAX the day before. The judge cited the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d the man could face as well as the likelihood that his deportation violated the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nPasquarella also said federal immigration officials have been urging some detainees to waive their applications for admission to the U.S., an allegation echoed by ACLU officials in other cities.\n\nIt was not clear what detainees were being threatened with, but Pasquarella suggested officials could threaten to deport detained individuals, which could have a long-term effect on their ability to reenter the U.S. at a later date.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nProtesters rally at LAX\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, an attorney and the executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said employees with U.S. Customs and Border Protection are not answering questions from lawyers seeking to speak with detainees, including how many detainees there are at the airport.\n\nOne detainee relayed to the ACLU that at least 100 people were being held on Saturday evening, Pasquarella said. Other immigration attorneys have corroborated that information, but cautioned that it was extremely difficult to get a reliable estimate. A law enforcement source told The Times that 13 people had been detained at Terminal 2 on Saturday night, but each of them held a green card and was eventually released. The source could not provide detention figures for the Tom Bradley International Terminal.\n\nJacob Kemper, a 35-year-old Army veteran who served two tours in Iraq, said he was infuriated to think soldiers he fought alongside might be denied entry to the country.\n\n\"I really don't care about religion, but I really hate oppression,\" he said, holding a sign that read, \"I Fought Next to Muslims.\" \"That's the way America is going.\"\n\nNurse Jamie Shoemaker, 51, of Los Angeles stood at the entrance of the international terminal holding an American flag in one hand and carrying a sign that read, \"Muslims are welcome here, racists and fascists are not.\"\n\nShe called Trump's order \"un-American.\"\n\n\"This is not the country I want,\" she said. \"This is not the country I grew up in.\"\n\nShay Soltani, a network engineer, fled the Iranian Revolution 40 years ago and still has family members in Iran. She doesn't know if she will be able to see them again.\n\nAs she and hundreds of others marched through the international terminal Sunday, she said she was horrified by Trump's order.\n\n\"I am so hurt by this,\" she said. \"He is against freedom of speech and the Constitution and everything I believe in as an American.\"\n\nShe said if Trump's order stands and his wall is built, \"what's the difference between us and Syria or Iran or any oppressive government?\"\n\nHis actions, she said, erode the very ideals that attract refugees to the United States.\n\n\"Otherwise why come here?\"\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order suspended refugee arrivals and banned entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. It indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nOn Saturday, after mass demonstrations across the country, a federal judge in New York ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the order.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "James Queally, Javier Panzar, Matt Hamilton", "type": "article"}
