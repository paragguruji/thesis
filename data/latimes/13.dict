Kennedy, who agreed to a temporary freeze.\n\nOn Tuesday, the full court said it had granted the administration's appeal. The 9th Circuit's ruling \"is stayed with respect to refugees covered by a formal assurance, pending further order of this court.\"\n\nNext month, the high court is scheduled to hear arguments on the legality of Trump's travel ban. It is possible the justices may decide the entire matter is moot by then. The travel ban was supposed to be in effect for 90 to 120 days.\n\nWhile the administration won Tuesday on the issue of refugees, it lost in seeking to limit grandparents and other close relatives from entering the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court in late June said the travel ban may not be enforced against foreigners who have a \"close\" family tie with someone in this country, and the 9th Circuit said that may include grandparents, in-laws and cousins.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-01", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
