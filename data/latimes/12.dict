Instead, they agreed to hear those arguments in the fall.\n\nBut they also largely rejected the lower court rulings that had blocked Trump\u2019s order as unconstitutional, handing a partial victory to the president and his lawyers after a string of rebukes in federal courts from Hawaii to Maryland.\n\nThe ruling clears the way for Trump\u2019s 90-day ban on foreign arrivals from six Muslim-majority countries to take effect, but it also carved out exemptions for those with \u201cbona fide relationships\u201d with Americans or U.S. entities, including spouses, other close family members, employers and universities.\n\nThe justices also strongly hinted that they may never need to settle the larger constitutional issues because the case could be moot by the time they hear it in the fall.\n\nThe administration argued it needed the 90-day pause to review and revise its vetting procedures for travelers from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Assuming the order takes effect now, the ban will have expired by October when the court reconvenes.\n\nTrump had long voiced confidence he would prevail when the travel ban case reached the high court and on Monday he called the decision a \u201cclear victory\u201d for his administration.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation\u2019s homeland,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe administration did not provide immediate specifics on how the decision would change existing policy, leaving attorneys at the Justice Department to review the court\u2019s language before working with other federal agencies to draft temporary rules.\n\nTrump officials also acknowledged that their optimism may be subject to change, depending on how far the government\u2019s lawyers are willing to push the ruling and how lower courts interpret the high court\u2019s language.\n\nThat caution contrasted with the administration\u2019s earlier handling of the issue, when Trump signed a hastily drafted travel ban just days after taking office. The result was a chaotic execution, with uncertainty at airports around the world over who would be allowed to enter the country.\n\nImmigrant rights lawyers who sued to block Trump\u2019s order were disappointed with Monday\u2019s ruling, but downplayed its impact.\n\nThe order \u201cwill take effect in a very limited way,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. The ban will apply \u201conly to a small subset of people who lack any relationship\u201d with a person in this country or an institution such as a school or a hospital.\n\nSome welcomed what they described as an implicit rebuke of the White House\u2019s assertion that Trump has unfettered powers to exclude arrivals based on purported national security concerns.\n\nBut others worried about the message it may send. It \u201cignores the anti-Muslim bigotry that is at the heart of the travel ban executive orders and will inevitably embolden Islamphobes in the administration,\u201d said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, said the partial reinstatement of the ban particularly threatens \u201cvulnerable people waiting to come to the U.S.,\u201d including those with urgent medical conditions.\n\nAll nine justices apparently agreed with the outcome Monday. Three of the court\u2019s conservatives \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have gone further and allowed the entire order to take effect immediately.\n\nUnder the compromise crafted by the court,\u201cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\u201d are exempted from the ban.\n\n\"The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity,\" the court said. \"So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.\"\n\nSince many visitors from the six affected countries have such a relationship, the impact of the order may be narrow.\n\nBut in his dissent, Thomas predicted the court\u2019s approach would fail and lead to a \u201cflood of litigation\u201d to determine which visitors are exempt.\n\n\u201cI fear that the court\u2019s remedy will prove unworkable,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cToday\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected countries who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation\u2019s homeland. \u2014 President Trump\n\nLast month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia upheld a district judge\u2019s ruling in Maryland blocking Trump\u2019s order. The appeals court, in a 10-3 decision, said the executive order reflected an unconstitutional discrimination based on religion. Its opinion cited Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to enact a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, the 9th Circuit Court in California upheld a district judge\u2019s ruling in Hawaii and ruled Trump\u2019s order was illegal because the president did not demonstrate a threat to national security.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued both decisions were fundamentally mistaken. They said the Constitution and immigration laws give the president the power to temporarily \u201csuspend\u201d the entry of foreigners, either individuals or groups. And they argued that the high court has made clear judges have no authority to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the president\u2019s determination that national security was in danger.\n\nWithout hearing arguments in the two cases, the justices agreed the lower courts had gone too far. The outcome suggests that many of the justices were as troubled by the bold intervention of the judges who blocked Trump\u2019s order as they were by the bold action of the new president.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": "David G.
