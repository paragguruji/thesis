Asked how he felt, he responded in Persian, which was translated by his niece: \u201cThis is what humanity looks like. This is what human rights looks like. I am shocked, honored and awed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease let them know I\u2019m not mad at anybody,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the greatest country in the world.\u201d\n\nAli Vayeghan, an Iranian citizen with a valid U.S. visa, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday after earlier being turned away. He had arrived in L.A. Friday evening, hours after President Trump signed a travel ban, and he was put on a plane to the United Arab Emirates on Saturday afternoon. The next day, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee granted a request that Vayeghan be brought back to L.A.

It also imposed a minimum four-month ban on refugees from any country coming into the U.S.\n\nCritics have said the order, which was billed as a way to better guard against terror attacks in the U.S., will alienate Muslims and do little to increase safety.\n\nNewly sworn-in Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said earlier this week that the restrictions target some countries that \u201care in various states of collapse\u201d and have poor record-keeping or unreliable police forces that undermine U.S. border officials\u2019 efforts to determine travelers\u2019 identities and criminal histories.\n\nVayeghan\u2019s return marked a dramatic reversal from Friday evening, when the 61-year-old arrived at LAX just hours after Trump signed the executive order, setting off chaotic scenes in airports as confused federal officials scrambled to decipher the new rules.\n\nWaiting for Vayeghan at the airport on that day was his brother, who lives in Los Angeles. The men had planned to spend a short visit catching up before Vayeghan continued on to Indiana, where he would reunite after 12 years with his son, a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe brother and other family members said they waited at LAX until after 3 a.m. Saturday, with scant information about his whereabouts.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and L.A.-based immigration attorney Stacy Tolchin stepped in, filing a habeas corpus petition Saturday that demanded Vayeghan\u2019s release. Attorneys argued that Trump\u2019s executive order violated Vayeghan\u2019s due process and was hostile to a specific religion, Islam, putting it at odds with the 1st Amendment\u2019s establishment clause.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee granted an emergency temporary restraining order instructing that Vayeghan be allowed to enter the country, but it arrived too late. Vayeghan had already been put on a plane to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAccording to his brother and attorneys who had sporadic phone contact with him, Vayeghan was pressured by officials to sign documents that revoked his immigrant visa. Regretting the decision afterward, he resisted demands that he board a plane for Dubai and was carried to his seat by authorities, an attorney for the ACLU said.\n\nGee amended her order and instructed that U.S. officials were to facilitate Vayeghan\u2019s return from Dubai and admit him to the country. Citing the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d Vayeghan would face if he was forced to go back to Iran, Gee ruled that his attorneys had showed a strong likelihood of successfully arguing that his denial to the U.S. violated federal law.\n\nInstead, officials in Dubai placed Vayeghan on a plane bound for Tehran.\n\nIn an email to The Times, a Department of Justice spokeswoman said her agency \u201ccoordinated with U.S. Customs and Border Protection in efforts to bring Mr. Vayeghan back to the United States as per the terms of the court\u2019s order.\u201d\n\nShe would not elaborate, and a Customs and Border Protection spokesman declined to answer questions, citing privacy rules. ACLU attorney Peter Bibring acknowledged that lawyers for Vayeghan coordinated with government officials in the U.S. and abroad to plan his return, but he declined to detail those efforts.\n\nAs they awaited a required stamp in his passport, Vayeghan and his relatives repeatedly hugged at an airport Starbucks, where some employees offered them free food. He held his brother tightly, and spoke excitedly about reuniting with his son.\n\nActivists who staged large-scale weekend protests against the executive order, which paralyzed traffic at the airport, approached to hug the family.\n\n\u201cWe were the loneliest people in the world on Friday,\u201d said Vayeghan\u2019s niece Marjan. \u201cBut this is the L.A. I know and love.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip. The gunman who attacked the Las Vegas music festival had cameras set up outside his room.
