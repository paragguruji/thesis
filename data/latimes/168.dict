Cannon, 48, never thought that her access to the global talent pool might be limited.\n\nNow she\u2019s not so sure.\n\nThe election of President Trump, she says, has increased anxiety in the entertainment industry about how the new administration\u2019s travel and immigration policies will affect visa applications and wait times for filmmakers and crew members who want to work on productions in the United States.\n\nI never thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to work with someone because they wouldn\u2019t be allowed into the country. \u2014 Los Angeles producer Rossi Cannon\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d said Cannon, executive producer at Mod/Op Films. \u201cI never thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to work with someone because they wouldn\u2019t be allowed into the country.\u201d\n\nCannon\u2019s concerns reflect widely shared worries in Hollywood that the administration\u2019s stance could cause headaches for the entertainment industry, which overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton. The film and TV business has become increasingly global, with film companies pursuing non-U.S. stars and international co-productions that depend on people\u2019s ability to travel the world with relative ease.\n\nHollywood\u2019s fears were exacerbated over the weekend after Trump signed an executive order that temporarily blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim countries and halted refugees from around the world on security grounds.\n\nAsghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of Oscar-nominee \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d said he would not travel to Los Angeles to attend the Academy Awards ceremony in response to Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nThe Motion Picture Assn. of America, the lobbying arm for the major studios, weighed in. Chris Dodd, the former Democratic senator from Connecticut who heads the MPAA, joined the Hollywood chorus of disapproval against the order that temporarily suspends travel from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe MPAA is concerned about the impact of the executive order on individuals with legitimate personal and business relationships in the United States,\u201d Dodd said in a statement. \u201cAmong those potentially affected are members of the creative community who cannot freely express themselves in their home country and come to the United States seeking the opportunity to communicate and enlighten.\u201d\n\nAlthough few filmmakers are directly affected by Trump\u2019s travel ban, immigration experts who work with talent say the fear is that broader scrutiny and restrictions will come.\n\nAny overhaul in the visa application process could create delays that will have ripple effects in Hollywood, potentially throwing a wrench into productions that rely on foreign talent, immigration experts said. The Trump administration has indicated it will revise the application process for H-1B visas, one of the more popular visas used for highly skilled workers in fields like technology. Major tech companies have pushed to protect H-1B visas and firms such as Google and Apple were among the first big companies to protest the executive order.\n\nBut changes to the visa program could also affect areas such as animation that rely heavily on non-citizens, said Chad Blocker, a partner at New York-based immigration law firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy.\n\n\u201cOne challenge for the entertainment industry is you have tight production schedules and it's necessary for talent to travel to the U.S. in a relatively short time frame,\u201d Blocker said. \u201cIf you see the government delaying processing, it's going to be even more of a challenge.\u201d\n\nSome, however, are optimistic about visa reforms. Rosanna Berardi, an immigration attorney whose clients include TV and film studios, said she believes the proposed changes will, in fact, make the H-1B program more business friendly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very broken system now,\u201d said Berardi, who is based in Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nBut for now, uncertainty prevails. Several immigration attorneys said they\u2019ve been bombarded with requests to file and expedite applications for work permits to let foreigners work on U.S. film and television productions. O-1 visas, which cover people with \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d in fields including arts, sciences and athletics, are in high demand.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s been no explicit indication that the government will restrict O-1 visas, entertainment workers have been racing to make sure they\u2019re covered, said Los Angeles-based immigration lawyer Lorraine D\u2019Alessio.\n\nSince the election, she said, the number of cases her law firm usually handles has tripled. One client, a Swedish citizen who was born in Iraq, passed on a film acting job out of fear he would run into trouble abroad, she said.\n\nEven prior to the executive order, U.S. consulates worldwide were taking more time to review and scrutinize applications, causing delays, D\u2019Alessio said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real nail-biter,\u201d she said. \u201cAcross the board since last weekend\u2019s events, we\u2019re seeing widespread anxiety with producers, directors and actors\u2026. People are wondering whether they should invest in certain productions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood business leaders have expressed misgivings about the temporary clampdown on travel.\n\n21st Century Fox, an entertainment juggernaut with business interests around the world, issued a statement late Monday that stopped short of criticizing Trump\u2019s order, but nonetheless expressed concern about employees who might find it difficult to travel.\n\n\u201cWe know this is a time of real uncertainty for many of our colleagues around the world,\u201d read the memo, signed by Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch and Fox CEO James Murdoch.\n\n\u201c[W]e want to assure you that we\u2019re doing what we can to assist impacted colleagues and their families.\" The company was founded by 85-year-old Rupert Murdoch, who was born in Australia and became a U.S. citizen in 1985. His two sons now run the company.\n\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei CAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A.
