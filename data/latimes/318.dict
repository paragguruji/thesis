Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion.\n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport.\n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d\n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million.\n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official.\n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.\n\nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching impact became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Laura King, Barbara Demick, Molly Hennessy-Fiske", "type": "article"}
