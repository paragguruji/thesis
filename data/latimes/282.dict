The news that\u2019s dominated Donald Trump \u2019s presidency is likely to be here for a while. Might as well settle in:\n\nWednesday\n\nBack to Russia. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, worked for a Russian billionaire about 10 years ago to advance Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s agenda.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes said U.S. intelligence officials intercepted communications involving Trump\u2019s transition team. According to Nunes, the conversations were picked up because Trump associates were communicating with individuals under surveillance. When asked if Trump felt vindicated by the revelations, he said he \u201csomewhat\u201d did.\n\nCourtroom drama. The Supreme Court unanimously strengthened the rights of 7 million schoolchildren with disabilities, rejecting a lower-court ruling that relied on a standard set by none other than Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch. The ruling came down during Gorsuch\u2019s nomination hearing. Ouch.\n\nThursday\n\nLet\u2019s talk healthcare. First off, GOP leaders postponed a vote on the Affordable Care Health Act \u2014 the replacement plan for Obamacare. Before that, there was a lot of back and forth over whether the White House had enough votes to pull off a win. Evidently, it didn\u2019t. By the end of the night, Trump threatened to leave Obamacare in place if the GOP bill failed. (P.S. The revised version would save even less money and still double the number of Americans without coverage to 24 million.\n\nStop, filibuster time. Democrats are planning to filibuster Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. For obvious reasons, the White House isn\u2019t happy about it.\n\nThe House Intelligence chair is backtracking on his claim about the surveillance on Trump\u2019s transition team, sort of. His aide said he has to get all the documents before \u201che knows for sure.\u201d\n\nAnother delay for Trump: his travel ban could be blocked for weeks. A federal appeals court said the earliest it would hear arguments is May.\n\nNo conflict of interest, said a federal agency about Trump\u2019s hotel near the White House. Trump can continue to lease his downtown Washington hotel from the federal government without worry.\n\nFriday, March 24\n\nIt\u2019s vote day. Just kidding! The GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act was already on shaky ground moving into the scheduled vote Friday. Paul Ryan and Trump met last-minute to talk about where the count stood. And then, at Trump\u2019s request, the bill was pulled, making it the second time House GOP leaders had to delay the vote.\n\nRemember Manafort? He volunteered to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the presidential election.\n\nWelcome back big oil. The Trump administration issued a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which had previously been rejected by Obama.\n\nA Virginia judge ruled in favor of Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying that it likely \u201cfalls within the bounds\u201d of Trump\u2019s authority as president. His ruling doesn\u2019t have an immediate effect on the ban, which was put on hold by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland last week.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough? We've got you covered for all of Trump's first 100 days. \u00bb \u00bb\n\nGrade the president\n\nNow that you\u2019re all caught up, here\u2019s your chance to tell us what you think of Trump as we track his major moves in the first 100 days.\n\nGrading opens every Friday and closes at the end of Monday.
