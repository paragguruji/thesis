However, from what I see, the president seems to have a thin skin due to some kind of insecurity regarding, perhaps, his intelligence. (\u201cWhite House aides who wrote Trump's travel ban see it as just the start,\u201d Jan. 30)\n\nFor protection, he has embraced two of his top advisors, Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller. He probably sees them as more intelligent than he and uses them as his crutch.\n\nThis is the terrifying part: They have him by the nose, and where are they leading him? Stay alert for the next chapter.\n\nCharlotte Schroeder, Costa Mesa\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: The one subject that our president has a deep knowledge of and has consistently and strongly supported is Donald Trump. He cares only about his own image, and it appears the United States takes a back seat when he sees an opportunity to create buzz about himself and build his brand.\n\nI sincerely hope that journalists are not distracted by \u201cshiny objects\u201d thrown out by the administration, such as the recent flurry of executive orders signed by the president.\n\nThe dominance of the travel ban in the news overshadowed the fact that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence will no longer regularly attend National Security Council meetings. They will be asked to attend on an as-needed basis, but Bannon (a truly dangerous man in my opinion) is now part of the council\u2019s principals committee.\n\nMargaret Sullivan, Woodland Hills\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Let\u2019s call a spade a spade: White nationalist Bannon has hijacked our government.\n\nThe executive orders were written by him and his cohort Miller, and the most reprehensible cabinet picks were theirs. Now Bannon will sit on the National Security Council instead of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence.\n\nWho will stop this farce? Who will stop Bannon? The Republicans? Congress? Or will we the people have to keep marching until the (diminished) powers that be acknowledge that the emperor has no clothes?\n\nJo-Ann McAuliffe, Venice\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
