Gen. Douglas Chin asks the court to approve a swift briefing schedule on the state's intended request for a temporary restraining order blocking the new travel ban before it takes effect on March 16.\n\nThe state said it would file a new complaint to supplement its initial challenge to an earlier, more comprehensive travel ban issued by the Trump administration in January.\n\nThe intent of both travel orders, Trump administration officials say, is to screen out visitors from countries affected by terrorism until more stringent vetting measures can be put into place.\n\nIn a second filing late Tuesday, Hawaii listed its reasons for challenging the new travel order. Hawaii says the new order has \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on residents, businesses and universities. The state also argues that the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Constitution.\n\nThe state's filing lists Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii, as an example of a Hawaii resident affected by the travel order. Elshikh's mother-in-law is a national of Syria, a country listed in the new travel ban. The state also says his mosque members' relatives live in countries under the new ban and would not be able to visit family in Hawaii.\n\nThe state's initial legal challenge to the president's first order on travel was filed Feb. 3 and was paused after a federal judge in Seattle blocked implementation of that order nationwide.\n\nLawyers from Washington state who brought the Seattle case said Monday that they had not decided if they would sue over the new travel rules.\n\nIn a separate filing Tuesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Department of Justice moved to dismiss its appeal of the Seattle court's ruling on the first executive order.\n\nThe new order has been stripped of many provisions which federal judges across the country found troublesome in the first one.\n\nTrump's new order does not give preference to religious minorities in refugee admissions. It exempts several categories of people from its restrictions, including dual nationals who have U.S. citizenship, green card holders and people who already hold valid visas.\n\nLegal experts have said the new travel ban, which applies to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Yemen -- it does not include Iraq as the previous order did -- will be tougher to battle in court because of the president's broad authority over immigration enforcement and national security when it comes to non-citizens and those without visas.\n\nUpdate: This article was updated with details on Hawaii's challenge of President Trump's executive order.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
