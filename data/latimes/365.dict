{"title": "Lawsuit could sink FBI headquarters", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/bs-ed-ag-lawsuit-letter-20170313-story.html", "text": "Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh recently announced plans to use his newfound power to sue the federal government by joining a Washington state lawsuit trying to upend Republican President Donald Trump's new travel ban (\"Maryland to join lawsuit against Trump travel ban,\" March 11).\n\nMr. Frosh says: \"It's a Muslim ban. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional. It's un-American.\" That is the typical Democratic spin on a temporary delay on immigrants from terrorist states. It is not a Muslim ban, it is not illegal or unconstitutional. But I guess as blue a state as Maryland is, anything that is anti-Trump is probably a good idea, right?\n\nThe problem is Maryland is vying with Virginia for the new FBI headquarters. Why would Mr. Frosh want to spit in the face of the people holding the purse strings and making the decision? He obviously knows nothing about marketing or sales and our legislators must not either or they would be telling Mr. Frosh not to join a useless lawsuit and take the chance you will throw the new FBI Headquarters to Springfield, Va.\n\nStick to suing Volkswagen, Mr. Frosh.\n\nCraig Garfield, Ellicott City", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-13", "authors": "Baltimore Sun", "type": "article"}
