The organization helps about 9,000 refugees a year with everything from civil rights and income taxes to small business loans and learning the English language at its offices in City Heights and El Cajon, she said.\n\nFriday\u2019s executive order indefinitely blocked anyone fleeing Syria and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S from seven majority Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 until more \u201cextreme vetting\u201d can be figured out.\n\nAt Lindbergh Field, a few hundred demonstrators gathered outside Terminal 2 to protest the order, acting in solidarity with demonstrators at airports across the country where immigrants from the affected countries were being detained. It was uncertain if there were similar detentions at the San Diego airport. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego directed questions to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security office in Washington, D.C.\n\nJames Elia, a U.S.-born citizen of Iraqi descent who lives in El Cajon, is concerned for his uncle, cousin and cousin\u2019s children, who after years were recently cleared to come to the U.S. as Christian refugees from Iraq. Family and friends in El Cajon had been in the process of raising money for the refugees preparing for their travel and resettlement. Their fate now is uncertain, even though Trump has indicated that he\u2019d like to prioritize Christian refugees over Muslims.\n\n\u201cThis executive order, it\u2019s a death sentence. No matter what we do, they can\u2019t come here until our president figures out what he wants to do,\u201d Elia, 30, said.\n\nMany of those who have fled the Islamic State were left with nothing, including birth certificates or identification.\n\nSan Diego County Chaldean leader Mark Arabo said he\u2019s been flooded with phone calls from the local community asking what Trump\u2019s executive order means for them, including whether it is safe for green-card holders to cross into Tijuana for medical services.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security clarified Saturday that the executive order pertains to green-card holders who come from the seven countries and are caught outside the U.S. They would be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cWe have over 10,000 Chaldeans in San Diego who have green cards, yet they can\u2019t afford health insurance here so they go to Tijuana for medical treatment,\u201d Arabo said. They have to decide whether to take care of their medical needs and \u201cpossibly risk not being allowed back into America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of unknowns,\u201d Arabo said. \u201cWe are telling them not to cross the border because we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nArabo, who has long been fighting for greater protection for minority Christians in Iraq, said he was encouraged by Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to accept more Chaldean refugees, but also criticized the blanket ban.\n\n\u201cThere should never be a religious test of any kind to enter the United States of America. The one thing we do finally see is that he\u2019s recognizing the extreme persecution of religious minorities, yes, but we should let everyone in. A refugee is a refugee, period,\u201d Arabo said.\n\nIn City Heights, many of the Muslim immigrants were just beginning to get word of the president\u2019s restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Syrian customers,\u201d said Nezar Ilaian, manager of the Mid-East Market. Some of them are refugees who arrived in the past year.\n\n\u201cFor the most part they thought it was just talk\u201d until now, he said.\n\nHis father, Hani Ilaiam, opened the market 30 years after coming to the United States from Palestine. The senior Ilaiam said Trump is just \u201ctwisting ears\u201d and that he gives the new president the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cHe always says things that are subject to change,\u201d Hani Ilaiam, a Muslim, said. \u201cHe wants to scare people coming to the United States, to make sure they are coming for peace and not terrorism.\u201d\n\nPeggy Peattie/U-T In City Heights Saturday, Ute Zischka fills out a note to add to the board inviting suggestions for an improved City Heights.

(Peggy Peattie/U-T)\n\nJust a few blocks away from the market, Dojaquez and representatives of about a dozen other service organizations gathered Saturday afternoon with area residents in a vacant lot on El Cajon Boulevard. Their afternoon of entertainment, brief speeches and information sharing was organized by the Mid-City Community Action Network.\n\n\n\nThe neighborhood get-together had been scheduled a week earlier, but was postponed because of rain. Sandra Alvarado, a member of the Mid-City CAN coordinating council, said the new date was fortunate because it gave residents a chance to react to the president\u2019s immigration announcement.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will encourage the community to be more active,\u201d she said.\n\nEvie Kosower, a volunteer with the San Diego Alliance for Justice, said she was hearing a lot of questions about the new president\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cI live in City Heights, and we\u2019re full of immigrants,\u201d Kosower said, adding that the president\u2019s executive order is \u201ctotally irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody is nervous as hell,\u201d she said. \u201cMy feeling is that it doesn\u2019t make for a good citizen.\u201d\n\nThe phones \u201chave been ringing off the hook\u201d at the Immigration Center for Women and Children, said Vanessa Ayala, outreach coordinator for the group.\n\nMany of the people with concerns are young professionals who immigrated years ago, she said.\n\n\u201cThey made it through school,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cNow they have a job \u2026 they\u2019re making a living, and they don\u2019t know if they will have to leave the community.\n\n\u201cI feel like now, more than ever, people are gearing up to make a stand,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nOthers applauded Trump for taking swift action, including Ernie Griffes. He was among a group of county residents against local refugee resettlement who tried to get cities throughout the county to drop official designations as \u201cwelcoming cities\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cWe need a moratorium on the refugee absorption process. It is overwhelming our neighborhoods with immigrant refugees who are being treated better than our homeless population and veterans,\u201d Griffes said. \u201cIt is rational to step back and sort it all out and proceed cautiously. Government\u2019s first responsibility is to its own citizens\u2019 safety and security. We selected him to do this and it needs to be done.\u201d\n\n", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Phil Diehl, Kristina Davis", "type": "article"}
