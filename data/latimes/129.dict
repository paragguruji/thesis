The administration has said it will take its case to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIn suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States,\" the ruling said\n\nThe 9th Circuit, which decides federal cases for nine Western states, also said that Trump\u2019s order violated a provision of immigration law that bars nationality-based discrimination.\n\nThe three judges \u2014 Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard Paez \u2014 were appointed by former President Clinton.\n\nTheir decision leaves in place a nationwide injunction issued by a federal judge in Hawaii in response to a lawsuit by the state and a Honolulu-based imam.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
