{"title": "Here\u2019s what the president of MIT thinks of the Trump administration\u2019s early moves", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-mit-president-qa-20170210-story.html", "text": "The student\u2019s email arrived early on Jan. 28.\n\nIt was addressed to Rafael Reif, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe undergraduate didn\u2019t want to bother him, she wrote, but she was stuck overseas and unable to return to campus because of the White House\u2019s newly imposed travel ban.\n\nIt was 6:37 a.m., but Reif didn\u2019t hesitate. He immediately contacted three of his top aides to help her and two other students in similar straits.\n\n\u201cThese people worked around the clock to make sure these kids made it home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\nOne week later, the students were safely back in Cambridge, but in the midst of the ordeal, Reif wrote a letter to the MIT community expressing his thoughts on the situation.\n\nHe wrote that the research university, founded in 1861, was at once uniquely American and profoundly global.\n\n\u201cLike the United States, and thanks to the United States, MIT gains tremendous strength by being a magnet for talent from around the world,\u201d he wrote. In that light, he said, the executive order appeared to him \u201ca stunning violation of our deepest American values, the values of a nation of immigrants: fairness, equality, openness, generosity, courage.\u201d\n\nReif is an immigrant himself. Born and educated in Venezuela, he came to the U.S. as a graduate student, earning his doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He joined the MIT faculty in 1980 and became its president in 2012.\n\nReif stopped by the Los Angeles Times this week to discuss science in the age of Trump and MIT\u2019s plan for the next four years.\n\nWhy do you think the scientific community has been so vocal in its opposition to the travel ban?\n\nI believe the reasons are obvious. Scientists love to collaborate and work with people who see things from a different perspective. When people work together to address big challenges \u2014 whether it\u2019s climate change or fresh water access or Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 you start recognizing people for what they can contribute to the big mission. It doesn\u2019t matter where you came from. It is irrelevant.\n\nWe have students from Turkey being supervised by faculty from Greece. Culturally they hate each other, but that doesn\u2019t come up at MIT because they are dealing with bigger issues than themselves.\n\nLast week Trump threatened on Twitter to cut off federal funding for UC Berkeley because violent protests prompted the university to cancel a talk by provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nI don\u2019t have all the details, but I understand that somebody whose views that are not politically acceptable to some members of the community was not allowed to speak. That doesn\u2019t help universities. We should allow everyone to say whatever they want. But I think having the U.S. president make a statement like that feels like an overreaction.\n\nAre you concerned Trump might continue to threaten universities with the loss of federal funds when they do something he doesn\u2019t agree with?\n\nThere are reasons to be concerned, but I would not panic.\n\nI like to think the administration is not fully staffed yet, and that we will get to a more stable and predictable situation sometime soon. Just like I wish the president did not overreact in the tweet, I don\u2019t want to overreact either. Let\u2019s just give him a chance to settle in, get the team together, and figure out in which direction they really want to take the country.\n\nMight federal agencies like the Department of Defense or the National Institutes of Health decide on their own to withhold funding if they think that\u2019s what the president wants?\n\nI\u2019m having a wait-and-see attitude. I am trying to speak as best I can for the need for us to understand each other\u2019s point of view. Let\u2019s recognize that we live in a democratic country and there are people who believe that what he tweeted was the right thing to say.\n\nThe last thing we need right now is to start a war between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d whoever \u201cthem\u201d are. We just have to figure out how to continue to build bridges and understand each other.\n\nThe election showed us that we are not all hearing the same information. Do you have any thoughts on how to break through people\u2019s bubbles and communicate with them?\n\nThe exercise I\u2019m practicing, and it seems to be working, is to find somewhere that we agree and once we establish that, extrapolate. If we start by not agreeing, we will never get anywhere.\n\nWhat\u2019s your plan for the next four years?\n\nThe big picture for MIT is to keep doing basic research because that is the mother of all knowledge. But we don\u2019t want to stop there. We also need to identify big problems and have people working on those. To me, the health of the planet and human health are the two critical ones that drive everything.\n\nSo we have a lot to do. Every day counts. We cannot stop what we are doing and get distracted. The last thing I want is for us to get distracted by him.\n\nPolitical upheaval to me is like waves on the beach. Underneath that we just have to keep going.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCAPTION This motion graphic shows highlights of Cassini's missions from 2004-2017.
