{"title": "Courts shouldn't try to plumb the 'original intent' of Trump's travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-trump-immigration-20170210-story.html", "text": "In its opinion refusing to reinstate President Trump\u2019s executive order limiting travel and immigration, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals didn\u2019t find it necessary to rule \u2014 even in the context of an application for a stay of a restraining order \u2014 on whether the order amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion in violation of the 1st Amendment. The claim that the order violated due process was enough to justify preventing it from going into effect.\n\nBut the three-judge panel nevertheless suggested that the executive order might be vulnerable to a religious discrimination claim based on Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail. As is well known, in December 2015 Trump advocated a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\"\n\nLater Trump replaced that blatant religious test with a proposal for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, refugees and visitors from areas with a history of terrorism. His Jan. 27 executive order suspended for 90 days the entry of persons from seven majority-Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order also gave priority to refugees fleeing religious persecution if they belonged to a \u201cminority\u201d religion \u2014 a preference that would benefit Christians in predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nThis, Trump\u2019s critics say, is the campaign\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban\u201d in disguise. And the 9th Circuit seemed to suggest that, when the judiciary reached the merits of the lawsuit, it might agree. The court said:\n\n\u201cThe states [of Washington and Minnesota] argue that the executive order violates the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses because it was intended to disfavor Muslims. In support of this argument, the states have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the executive order was intended to be that ban . . . It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order is unjustified and ought to be rescinded, and his original proposal for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d was outrageous.\n\nBut it would be a mistake for the courts to equate the executive order with the original Muslim ban, and not only for the obvious reason that it\u2019s literally not a ban on Muslims. (It applies to non-Muslim citizens of the seven countries and doesn\u2019t apply to citizens of other predominantly Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.)\n\nThe bigger problem is that the 9th Circuit seems to float the idea that Trump\u2019s \u201coriginal intent was to go after Muslims because they were Muslims \u2014 that is, that he was animated by religious hatred.\n\nIt\u2019s far more likely that Trump was engaging in what lawyers would call over-inclusive thinking: The terrorists he was concerned about were Muslims, so he decided to \u201cerr on the safe side\u201d and ban all Muslims. It was an idiotic as well an offensive impulse. After smarter people pointed that out to him, he backed down and adopted a more targeted strategy. (That the strategy wasn\u2019t targeted enough doesn\u2019t mean that it was a violation of the 1st Amendment.)\n\nIf the Jan. 27 executive order is no different from a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d because we know what Trump \u201creally\u201d intended, the same would be true of any revised executive order, even if were justified by the sort of evidence that wasn\u2019t adduced to justify this order. That would mean that Trump would be held hostage by his own careless campaign rhetoric, prevented from imposing any restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries for the rest of his term.\n\nFinally, although Trump is unique among modern presidential candidates in openly promising to bar every member of an entire religion from an entering the United States, other politicians also make outlandish statements on the campaign trail that judges might use to deconstruct the more prudent policies the politicians pursued once they were in office.\n\nAs Eugene Kontorovich pointed out in the Washington Post: \u201cThe 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling \u2026throws open a huge door to examinations of the entire lives of political officials whose motives may be relevant to legal questions. This introduces more uncertainty and judicial power into legal interpretation than even the most robust use of legislative/administrative history. Without a clear cutoff at assumption of office, attacks on statutes will become deep dives into politicians\u2019 histories.\u201d\n\nThe words of Trump\u2019s executive orders will give courts enough work to puzzle over; they don\u2019t have to sift through his campaign speeches.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
