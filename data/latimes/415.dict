Police aren't eager to help Trump enforce immigration laws", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-trump-immigration-cops-20170130-story.html", "text": "A day after Donald Trump was elected president, two detectives walked up to a building site in Koreatown. The pair was hoping to find someone who might have witnessed a motorist intentionally knocking down a construction worker.\n\nThey introduced themselves to a group of Latino workers. The workers got up and walked away.\n\n\u201cTrump is coming,\u201d one of them said as he left.\n\nTo Det. Brent Hopkins, the scene was a stark illustration of the difficulties he could face depending on how far President Trump goes in enlisting local law enforcement to rid the country of people who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\u201cIt is my job to investigate crimes,\u201d said Hopkins of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Wilshire Division, who also serves on the police union\u2019s communications committee. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t do that, I can\u2019t get justice for people, because all of a sudden, I\u2019m losing my witnesses or my victims because they\u2019re afraid that talking to me is going to lead to them getting deported.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s unveiling last week of two executive orders that called for empowering local law enforcement officers to take on the duties of immigration agents, police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies across the Los Angeles area said in interviews that enforcing immigration laws is not in their job descriptions. Many expressed concerns that immigrants already wary of reporting crimes or being interviewed as witnesses will retreat further into the shadows.\n\n\u201cThey should be running to us, not away from us,\u201d said LAPD Deputy Chief Robert Arcos of Central Bureau, which includes Boyle Heights, MacArthur Park, Chinatown and other areas with many immigrant residents. \u201cWe are here to be their protectors.\u201d\n\nBesides, some officers said, they are too busy answering 911 calls, arresting robbers, stopping erratic drivers and solving homicides to add federal immigration enforcement to their to-do lists.\n\n\u201cWe have enough issues just trying to keep the peace anyway,\u201d said J.C. Duarte, a veteran LAPD officer in Northeast Division. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create a wedge between immigrants and law enforcement. Whether they\u2019re here legally or not, there\u2019s going to be a fear generated.\u201d\n\nMany officers said they believe their bosses will resist Trump\u2019s directives, despite the president\u2019s threat to withhold federal funding.\n\nThe LAPD has long had a policy that forbids officers from initiating contact with a person solely to ask about immigration status.\n\nOn Wednesday, hours after Trump unveiled his executive orders, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck reiterated that his officers would continue to focus on building relationships with city residents, regardless of where they were born. L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said his deputies do not ask anyone about their legal status and that immigration enforcement remains a federal responsibility.\n\nIn the state Legislature, Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n is championing a measure that would prohibit California police officers from engaging in immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be enforcing any immigration laws whatsoever,\u201d said Cmdr. Keith Swensson, who oversees the Central Patrol Division, which includes Compton and parts of East and South L.A., for the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cThe whole concept seems to be overpoliticized, when in fact we\u2019re going to be doing the same thing we\u2019ve always been doing.\u201d\n\nThe racial demographics of L.A County\u2019s two largest law enforcement agencies reflect those of the region as a whole. In both the LAPD and the county\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Department, nearly half of the sworn officers are Latino. It is not uncommon for a police officer or sheriff\u2019s deputy to be an immigrant or the child of immigrants. Duarte, the Northeast Division officer, came to the U.S. legally from Guatemala at age 2.\n\nDuring the presidential election, Trump found support among some law enforcement officers who viewed him as more pro-police than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. But locally, even some officers who privately said they voted for him are not eager to help with his immigration agenda.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders call for the resurrection of Secure Communities, a program from earlier in Obama\u2019s administration that asked jail officials to hand over inmates to immigration authorities, including inmates who had no criminal records and were guilty only of immigration violations.\n\nBut Trump has not spelled out any specific plans to enlist street officers in apprehending immigrants without legal status. The executive orders say that local law enforcement agencies will be empowered \u201cto perform the functions of an immigration officer \u2026 to the maximum extent permitted by law\u201d but provide no detail.\n\nAn Arizona law, Senate Bill 1070, tested the legal limits of what immigration enforcement duties police officers could perform. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of the Arizona law but let stand a provision that required police to check the immigration status of someone they had already stopped if there was \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d the person was in the country illegally.\n\nIf Trump asks police agencies to perform immigration checks along the lines of the Arizona law, participation would have to be voluntary, because the federal government cannot coerce local governments to do its work, constitutional law scholars say.\n\nThe funding component of Trump\u2019s executive orders, which involves withholding federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities, could face legal hurdles, because courts could view it as an underhanded way to force cooperation, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration scholar and professor at UCLA School of Law.\n\n\u201cIf the LAPD doesn\u2019t want to be involved in immigration checks, the feds can\u2019t force the LAPD to do that,\u201d Motomura said.\n\nStill, the specter of police officers checking residents\u2019 legal status has stirred anxiety among some immigrants.\n\nAt roll calls, Capt. Martin Baeza of the LAPD\u2019s Hollenbeck Division has been reiterating to his officers that their job is enforcing state laws, not federal immigration laws.\n\nAt community meetings, he tries to tamp down fears, answering questions that included one about whether internment camps, such as those used to imprison Japanese Americans during World War II, might arise again.\n\n\u201cI completely understand the anxiety that our community is having, because I\u2019ve lived that as a child,\u201d said Baeza, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 2.\n\nBaeza\u2019s parents had green cards, but they still viewed the police with fear. His parents would tell him not to get into trouble and not to have anything to do with the police, he recalled.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Cindy Chang, Kate Mather, Nicole Santa Cruz", "type": "article"}
