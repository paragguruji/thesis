{"title": "Trump faces major hurdles \u2014 and his own words \u2014 in challenging rulings against his new travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-travel-ban-blocked-maryland-20170316-story.html", "text": "When President Trump issued his first travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, the stated premise was simple: Give the government 90 days to review its vetting procedures to reduce the chances that a terrorist could get a U.S. visa.\n\nThat was 48 days ago.\n\nWith the executive order blocked by the courts \u2014 and judges now halting a revised order that was supposed to take effect Thursday \u2014 the legal battle over the constitutionality of the ban stretches on. Trump has vowed to pursue it all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nBy then his administration will have had several weeks to review screening procedures, which opponents said weakens its original case for why the ban is necessary.\n\nThe ticking of time is just one of several problems Trump faces as his administration contemplates what so far has been a major blow to his fledgling presidency.\n\n\u201cHe keeps losing,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist who helped run Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cHe keeps facing these setbacks. At what point do they give up?\u201d\n\nSigning the original order was among Trump\u2019s first acts as president, an effort to make good on promises of a \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d and \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to prevent terrorism that were a centerpiece of the campaign.\n\nBut the courts rebelled. After a federal judge in Seattle and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco put the original order on hold last month, the administration retooled it in hopes of addressing constitutional concerns.\n\nThen on Wednesday a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the revised order, which called for pausing all refugee resettlement for 120 days and blocking citizens of six Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 from entering the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nIn a further rebuke of the order, a federal judge in Maryland ruled Thursday against the provision restricting travelers.\n\nThat leaves the Trump administration with few good options.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that the administration would \u201cappeal the flawed rulings\u201d and focus its initial challenge on the Maryland case in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.\n\nThat would let the Trump administration avoid \u2014 at least for now \u2014 taking the Hawaii case to the 9th Circuit, which Trump called a \u201cbad\u201d court after it blocked him the first time.\n\nThe 9th Circuit long ago developed a reputation for being more liberal than other federal appeals courts, although many lawyers say that's no longer the case. Judges appointed by Democratic presidents outnumber Republican appointees on both the 9th and 4th circuit courts, but depending on luck of the draw, the three-judge panels that resolve cases in either circuit could include either conservative or liberal judges.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a split between the two appeals courts, then it could possibly go to the Supreme Court for review,\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\nIf the immigration restrictions are ultimately defeated, part of the reason will have been Trump the campaigner.\n\nIn the Maryland case \u2014 which was brought on behalf of immigrants from Syria, Somalia and Iran whose families are in the middle of the visa approval process \u2014 U.S. District Judge Theodore \u200bChuang\u2019s decision quoted Trump\u2019s campaign vows to suspend Muslim immigration as evidence that \u201cthe national security purpose is not the primary purpose of the travel ban.\u201d\n\nThe judge, who was nominated to the bench by President Obama, wrote that it was \u201clikely\u201d that Trump\u2019s ban violated the Constitution by discriminating against Muslims.\n\nThe U.S. district judge in the Hawaii case, brought by state Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin, seemed to agree, writing that despite the ban\u2019s \u201cstated secular purpose,\u201d Trump\u2019s own words acted against him.\n\n\u201cThe illogic of the government\u2019s contention is palpable,\u201d wrote the judge, Derrick Watson, also an Obama nominee. \u201cThe notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nNone of the court orders on the travel ban are permanent but instead are meant to halt it while more thorough court proceedings determine its constitutionality.\n\nBut the Trump administration's defeats have left some legal and political experts at a loss about what options it has left.\n\nMargo Schlanger, law professor at the University of Michigan who was the head of civil rights for the Department of Homeland Security under Obama, said that Trump\u2019s decision to delay the rollout of the revised order undermines his case that the order is urgent.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult for him to argue there's an emergency need for a stay,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time, the heavy focus on campaign statements in the recent rulings against Trump has perplexed other legal scholars, who predicted that Trump would prevail in appeals courts or in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCandidates often speak very loosely, and I think it\u2019s very risky to give that much weight to what candidates say during the campaign,\u201d said Arthur Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nCourts routinely look to legislative intent in interpreting laws passed by Congress. An appeals or Supreme Court decision in the case may determine whether they can also look to executive intent in deciding an executive order's constitutionality.\n\nI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way. \u2014 President Trump\n\nJonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said the battle would be a long one that is \u201cclearly being groomed for the Supreme Court.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem , Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
