President Trump\u2019s previous order was blocked by federal courts.\n\n\u201cThe administration's restriction of travel to the United States for nationals of six countries and a perceived \u2018anti-welcome\u2019 sentiment have caused deep concerns across the international travel and tourism community,\u201d said Ernest Wooden Jr., chief executive of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Assn., the trade group for the nation\u2019s $2.1-trillion travel industry, echoed Wooden\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe question remains whether the revised order did enough to mollify the prospective traveler from Canada, Europe or elsewhere around the world who may have been put off by the initial travel ban,\u201d said Roger Dow, chief executive of the group.\n\nThere is yet no conclusive data to show that travel has dropped since the new ban was announced. However, a survey of 324 corporate travel managers from the U.S. and Europe found that 37% of U.S. travel managers expect the new ban will reduce travel to the U.S. while 47% of European managers said they expect a reduction in travel to the U.S.\n\nThe survey, conducted on behalf of the Global Business Travel Assn., a trade group for the world\u2019s business travel managers, also found that the ban made 34% of travel managers worried about the harassment of U.S. travelers visiting the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThere is always the risk that closing our borders sends the message that the United States is closed for business,\u201d said Michael McCormick, executive director and chief operating officer of the trade group.\n\nhugo.martin@latimes.com\n\nTo read more about the travel and tourism industries, follow @hugomartin on Twitter.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-13", "authors": "Hugo Martin", "type": "article"}
