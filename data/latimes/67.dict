Gorsuch.\n\nThe president and First Lady Melania Trump signed the guest book and had photos taken with the justices, according to a court spokeswoman.\n\nThe brief meeting came as the justices are weighing the fate of the president's proposed temporary ban on travel from six Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTrump's acting Solicitor Gen. Jeffrey Wall, who took part in Thursday's ceremony, has urged the justices to lift the lower court rulings that blocked Trump's order from taking effect. He argued those rulings wrongly crimped the president's power over immigration.\n\nThe justices are likely to vote on his motion next Thursday.\n\nTrump has suffered a series of setbacks in the lower courts but has said he is confident he will prevail in the Supreme Court. It would take the votes of five justices to put the travel ban into effect.\n\nThe justices also met the president on April 10 when they were invited to the White House Rose Garden to witness Gorsuch being sworn in. The new justice took a separate judicial oath in a private ceremony at the court in April.\n\nIn recent decades, presidents have often come to the court to witness the swearing-in one of their new justices. But it was unusual for a new president to have a major case pending before the justices.\n\nIn Thursday's investiture ceremony, Trump and his wife sat in the justice's guest seats next to retired Justice John Paul Stevens. Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein, representing the Justice Department, presented to the court a rolled parchment paper that contained Gorsuch's commission, which was signed by Trump.\n\nAfter the commission was read, Gorsuch stepped up to the bench and joined his new colleagues. There he recited an oath promising to administer justice fairly and to \"do equal right to the poor and to the rich.\"\n\nThe courtroom was filled with judges, senators and former Justice Department officials as well as family and friends of the new justice.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
