Though it turned down Trump\u2019s request for an immediate reinstatement of the ban, the 9th Circuit will still consider the administration\u2019s appeal and asked for responses and counter-responses from both sides by Monday.\n\nSeveral courts around the country have questioned whether parts of the ban are discriminatory. The White House and many Republicans defend it as necessary for national security.\n\nBut despite the administration\u2019s attempts to stay on message as a broader constitutional confrontation loomed, the president himself \u2014 as has happened often in his nascent administration \u2014 proved a potent source of distraction over the weekend through his comments and tweets.\n\nSome Republicans moved Sunday to distance themselves from two days of repeated attacks by Trump against the Seattle federal judge, James Robart, who blocked the ban\u2019s implementation Friday.\n\n\u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Trump said Sunday on Twitter. A day earlier he referred to the Republican-appointed jurist as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d\n\nAlso grabbing attention was Trump\u2019s inflammatory comparison of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s deadly reprisals against domestic enemies with American acts of violence.\n\nAsked by Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly why Trump had such respect for the Russian leader when \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nHe went on to reference the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. \u201cTake a look at what we\u2019ve done too. We\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Trump renewed his threat to strip federal funding from California if it proceeds with a proposal to resist Trump\u2019s deportation plans for immigrants here illegally and become the first sanctuary state.\n\n\u201cCalifornia in many ways is out of control,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe result of Trump\u2019s latest remarks was that Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans found themselves spending as much time defending and explaining the president\u2019s comments as advocating for the travel ban.\n\nDemocrats expressed dismay over Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks against the judge, saying they suggested the president did not respect the independence of the judiciary.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d said Trump\u2019s ban should have been handled in consultation with Congress. She expected the matter to eventually end up in the Supreme Court \u2014 meaning the entire flap could color confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cThe president is not a dictator,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThe framers of our Constitution wanted a strong Congress for the very reason that most of these kinds of things should be done within the scope of lawmaking.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans defended the need for a travel ban, though many questioned how it had been rolled out, causing chaos and confusion in airports and embassies worldwide.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers took issue with Trump\u2019s personal attacks on the judge and his comments about Putin, rejecting any moral comparison between the Russian leader and the U.S.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand language like that,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges. We don\u2019t have so-called senators. We don\u2019t have so-called presidents.\u201d\n\nSasse also expressed dismay at Trump\u2019s remarks about Putin.\n\n\"There is no moral equivalency between the United States of America, the greatest freedom-loving nation in the history of the world, and the murderous thugs that are in Putin's defense of his cronyism,\" Sasse said. \"There's no moral equivalency there.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d said he wasn\u2019t going to \u201ccritique every utterance\u201d of Trump\u2019s, but didn\u2019t defend him either. \u201cI obviously don\u2019t see this issue the same way he does,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is different \u2014 we don\u2019t operate in any way the way the Russians do.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also raised concerns over restricting travel. \u201cThe courts are going to decide whether the executive order the president issued is valid or not,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cThere is a fine line here between proper vetting and interfering with the kind of travel or suggesting some kind of religious test. And we need to avoid doing that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nPressed about Trump\u2019s criticism of the judge, Pence downplayed Trump\u2019s tweets, saying in an interview on \u201cThis Week\u201d that the American people were \u201cvery accustomed to this president speaking his mind.\u201d\n\nPence also defended the decision-making process behind the travel ban, one of a flurry of executive orders in Trump\u2019s first days in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI think the early days of this administration are going to be described in history books as days of action,\u201d the vice president said.\n\nHe said the White House would abide by the court\u2019s decision, but he expressed unhappiness over what he described as judicial efforts to improperly interfere with the president\u2019s authority.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": "Laura King", "type": "article"}
