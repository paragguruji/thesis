The war against same-sex marriage is just getting started", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-trump-lgbt-religious-freedom-pence-20170209-story.html", "text": "An executive order leaked to the media last week revealed plans to use the Oval Office to legalize broad discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religion. A draft of the order, first published in The Nation, would allow\ufeff \u201cany organization, including closely held for-profit corporations\u201d to refuse services to LGBT people, whether in housing, employment, education or healthcare. In the media uproar that followed, Donald Trump said that he would not sign the order at this time.\n\nBut the president did not rule out doing so in the future.\n\nThe document is a reminder that while Trump has claimed he won\u2019t overturn marriage equality in the White House, he doesn\u2019t have to repeal Obergefell v. Hodges \u2014 the Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage \u2014 to strip the rights of gay and lesbian couples. The order is specifically designed to allow anyone who has a religious objection to same-sex marriage to discriminate in the name of faith \u2014 and would prevent the government from taking action against any individual who acts on those views. This would allow full federal protections for people like Kim Davis, the Rowan County, Ky., clerk who famously refused to sign marriage licenses for legally wedded couples in 2015.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Trump flip-flopped on the subject of marriage equality numerous times. After claiming that he would appoint justices to erase the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 marriage ruling, the president told Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes that he would use the bully pulpit to target the ruling. Trump, who said his personal view on same-sex marriage is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d claimed the case \u201cwas already settled.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s law,\u201d the POTUS said. \u201cIt was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said that he would not sign an anti-LGBT executive order at this time...but he didn't rule out doing so in the future.\n\nWhat makes this claim rather disingenuous is that Trump doesn\u2019t need the court system to neuter the protections allowed by Obergefell v. Hodges, which offer the full legal rights of marriage to all couples.\n\nSame-sex partners may get to keep their marriages under the Trump administration, but those unions will mean little if the federal government erodes the rights and benefits afforded to that status.\n\nIn essence, the leaked document is an executive version of the First Amendment Defense Act \u2014 or HR 2802 \u2014 a national version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws introduced in states like Indiana and Louisiana. The bill, which is co-sponsored by Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), protects the moral convictions of anyone who believes \u201cmarriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.\u201d Under HR 2802, it would be perfectly legal for a photographer to decide not to shoot a same-sex couple\u2019s wedding or an adoption agency to turn down that same couple\u2019s application.\n\nThe bill \u2014 which also could be used to fire a gay employee for having a picture of his legally wedded partner on his desk, or to deny housing to a lesbian couple \u2014 will be debated by Congress later this year. On his campaign website, Trump vowed to sign it.\n\nTrump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, would appear to confirm the administration\u2019s commitment to so-called religious liberty over the rights of same-sex couples. Gorsuch, a far-right nominee who once referred to equal marriage as part of the liberal \u201csocial agenda,\u201d sided with Hobby Lobby in 2012 as a justice for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled that the popular home goods brand could legally deny contraception provided to employees by the Affordable Care Act on the basis of faith. The Supreme Court later would vote in kind.\n\nIt remains to be seen how a SCOTUS with Gorsuch on the bench would rule if many of the central tenets of marriage equality \u2014 the equal protection of same-sex couples under the law \u2014 are disputed by religious liberty advocates.\n\nThe impending challenges to same-sex marriage, though, may take place sooner rather than later. The Texas Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this year on a case out of Houston, a trial that will decide whether same-sex couples in the Lone Star State are entitled to the same marriage benefits as heterosexual couples. Although the court passed on it in September, the case has been a favorite of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who repeatedly lobbied for the judges to reconsider hearing it. Patrick, who famously suggested that the LGBT victims of the Pulse massacre deserved to be murdered, served as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman in Texas.\n\nJustice John Devine, the most far-right member of the Texas Supreme Court, already has stated his opposition to providing spousal benefits to same-sex couples, which he believes are not guaranteed under existing law. \u201cMarriage is a fundamental right,\u201d wrote Devine in September, when the court voted 8-1 not to try the case. \u201cSpousal benefits are not.\u201d\n\nThat case will be heard in March, and it\u2019s just one of numerous battles LGBT advocates will fight this year in order to protect recent gains in civil rights. 2016 was the first full legislative session following the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which fanned the flames of anti-LGBT hate across the U.S. Over 200 bills targeting the rights of the community were heard by state legislatures last year, a figure that more than doubled over the prior year. A majority of these cases were over the very religious objections that will take center stage this year.\n\nThe LGBT community would appear to have won an important victory with Trump\u2019s momentary decision to put his executive order on hold \u2014 after many claimed it was already a done deal. But be warned: The war against same-sex marriage is just getting started.\n\nNico Lang is co-editor of the Boys anthology series. You can read his work in Rolling Stone, Salon and the Onion A.V.
