Far from making us safer, by excluding this most vetted and most vulnerable population, the executive order helps terror groups by providing yet another platform for anti-American propaganda,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe new travel order is \"a ban that heartlessly targets the most vetted and most vulnerable population to enter the United States,\" said IRC President and CEO David Miliband, who is a former British foreign minister. The group's resettlement program is in place in 28 U.S. cities.\n\n\"This ban doesn\u2019t target those who are the greatest security risk, but those least able to advocate for themselves. Instead of making us safer, it serves as a gift for extremists who seek to undermine America,\" he said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
