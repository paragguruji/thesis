Kennedy International Airport despite having done work for the U.S. government.\n\nState Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra joined the friend-of-the-court brief filed in federal court in New York supporting the lawsuit by Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi.\n\nThe two men had been threatened with violence in Iraq due to work they and their families did for the U.S. government, Becerra said. Darweesh was denied entry while holding an Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa for which he was eligible due to his work as an interpreter and engineer for the U.S. in Iraq from 2003 to 2011.\n\nAlshawi was denied entry despite holding a \u201cFollow to Join\u201d visa in order to join his spouse and child, who are lawful permanent U.S. residents living in Houston.\n\n\u201cPeople who risked their lives by helping us in Iraq \u2014 and have undergone extensive vetting to come to the United States \u2014 deserve better,\u201d Becerra said in a statement after joining 14 other states in filing supportive briefs in the case.\n\n\u201cWhen individuals stick their neck out for the United States, we should reward them by showing them that we have their back,\u201d he added. \u201cNo patriotic American would expect anything less.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Patrick McGreevy", "type": "article"}
