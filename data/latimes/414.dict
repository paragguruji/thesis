He has been sharply critical of the nuclear deal Iran signed with the United States and other world powers, although he has not taken concrete steps to dismantle it. Under the agreement, Iran shelved its uranium enrichment \u2014 which Western experts feared could be the precursor to a nuclear weapon \u2014 in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions.\n\nTrump also imposed new sanctions against Iranian companies last week, although they were seen as a largely symbolic measure, after Iran conducted a missile test.\n\nTrump has accused former President Obama of appeasing Iran, tweeting Tuesday that Obama made a deal with Iran despite it being \u201c#1 in terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian regime remains broadly supportive of the nuclear deal, which allowed an influx of foreign investment and started to reverse years of international isolation. But with a presidential election due in May, Khamenei and other hardliners have stepped up criticism of the agreement, saying the U.S. has blocked economic recovery by keeping some severe sanctions in place.\n\nKhamenei rejected the idea that Iran should be grateful to the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWhy should we thank the former president? For creating Daesh?\u201d Khamenei was quoted as saying Tuesday, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. \u201cFor setting fires in Syria and Iraq? For hypocrisy?\u201d\n\nHe went on to accuse Obama of supporting \u201cseditious\u201d protests in Iran against the disputed 2009 presidential election.\n\nKhamenei called on Iranians to show their defiance of Trump and the U.S. government by demonstrating Friday to commemorate the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
