The suit argued that the president\u2019s moves had amounted to religious discrimination against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Justice Department said it would appeal the order by Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush who is now senior judge of the U.S. District for the Western District of Washington.\n\nEarly Sunday, the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit denied a request to immediately reinstate Trump\u2019s travel ban, asking both sides to file arguments by Monday.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Michael A.
