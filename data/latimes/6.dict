They remained confident they had a good chance of winning in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn late June, the justices set aside rulings by the lower courts that had blocked Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban, allowing parts of it to take effect.\n\nAt the same time, the justices agreed to hear arguments from the administration\u2019s lawyers who said the president has \u201cbroad authority to prevent aliens from entering this country if he deems it to be in the nation\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nBut a key part of the temporary travel ban \u2014 which restricted nationals from six mostly Muslim countries \u2014 expired on Sunday.\n\nIn its place, the president issued a 28-page proclamation setting forth a revised and expanded entry ban that affects seven nations, including now Chad and North Korea. Sudan was dropped for the previous list, which included Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAnd unlike the earlier versions, the new restrictions will extend indefinitely.\n\nThe new ban in effect rendered the pending cases moot. In a brief order, the justices asked the lawyers on both sides to submit letters by Oct. 5 on what should be done next. And they added, \u201cThe cases are removed from the oral argument calendar, pending further order of the court.\u201d\n\nStill unresolved is the part of the temporary order that blocked refugees from the six originally targeted nations. That part of the order expires in late October, and the administration may wait until then to say what comes next.\n\nMeanwhile, the law that governs admission of refugees says that the president is supposed to set annual levels by Oct. 1 of each year. Advocates for refugees fear that Trump will keep the level at 50,000, the temporary cap he put in the earlier version of the travel ban \u2014 or even make it lower. Obama had set a goal at 110,000 refugees.\n\n\u201cI think what he was trying to do is lay the groundwork to substantially lower the number of refugees who are welcomed into the U.S.,\u201d said Cathryn Miller-Wilson, executive director of the Pennsylvania branch of HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency, adding that advocates will be making their case to Congress this week.\n\nIn the case of refugees fleeing violent governments, it's unlikely that the governments would cooperate in sharing information about them, she said. And she said it often takes years for refugees to win approval to enter the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re desperate and they\u2019re survivors, and now we\u2019re going to be slamming the door in their faces,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts in immigration law were divided over whether Trump\u2019s revised order stands a better chance of being upheld. Some said the new order stands on stronger ground because it reflects a careful review of the vetting procedures in the affected countries.\n\n\u201cRestrictions were tailored, as appropriate, given the unique conditions and deficiencies in each country,\u201d the White House said. The new order exempts current visa holders and immigrants who are lawful permanent residents in this country.\n\nBut others said the new restrictions are more vulnerable to legal challenge because they are permanent. This \u201cundermines the structure and purpose\u201d of the federal immigration law, said Peter Margulies, a law professor at Roger Williams Law School in Rhode Island.\n\nThe legal dispute may focus again on two seemingly conflicting parts of the law. One provision, cited regularly by Trump\u2019s lawyers, says the president has the power to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d as he deems appropriate. But another provision, cited by the challengers, says immigrants may not be denied entry because of their nation of origin.\n\nIn justifying this third version of the travel restrictions, the administration took pains to describe their efforts to analyze the security situation in countries around the world \u2014 even though the list of countries with restrictions stayed mostly the same. Some legal experts say that might help Trump defend his ban from what will almost certainly be another set of legal attacks.\n\nBut lawyers opposing the ban can point to Trump\u2019s rhetoric from last year, calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\u201cWhen you start with an illegal attempt and whittle away at it to present something that doesn\u2019t look as bad as the first iteration, your original sin in a sense carries forward with you,\" she said.\n\n\u201cCountry here is just a proxy for religion,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump came in and campaigned on an absolute myth that we don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming into the country, that we don\u2019t actually vet them, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact the U.S. has one of the strictest visa vetting regimes in the world.\u201d\n\nDecision time at the Supreme Court: A look at this term's rulings on religion, free speech and immigration \u00bb\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
