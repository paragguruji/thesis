Other centers across the nation also had to cut workers or shutter offices.\n\nLost in the fight over whether the president can bring a 120-day pause to all refugees coming in is that the executive order also cuts by more than half the number of refugees allowed into the country, said Marla Sell, site director of the refugee settlement program run by Bethany Christian Services in Allentown.\n\nIt has advocates concerned about whether the nation's fragile refugee settlement network can be restored anytime soon, even if it wins in court.\n\n\"We had no refugees arrive in March. Zero. Only seven in April, and none so far this month,\" Sell said. \"The ban will probably end up before the Supreme Court, but even if we win, we have to wonder if this is what we can expect going forward.\"\n\nPHOTO GALLERY: Refugees takes an English language class at the Episcopal Church of the Mediator in Allentown. Federal judges will soon decide whether President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban can legally curtail the stream of refugees coming to the U.S., but refugee centers in Allentown are dealing with a harsh reality: it already has. (Harry Fisher) (Harry Fisher)\n\nThe issue came to the forefront Jan. 27 when Trump, fulfilling a campaign promise, issued an executive order freezing immigration from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, while suspending new refugee arrivals for 120 days and slashing this year's quota from 110,000 refugees to 50,000.\n\nIt immediately sparked outrage and protests across the country.\n\nResponding to challenges, federal judges temporarily blocked parts of the order, leaving in limbo centers such as the one in Allentown that expected far more refugees to arrive at their doorstep.\n\nTrump in March issued a new executive order, removing Iraq from the list of countries from which immigration was banned for 90 days, and lifting the complete ban on Syrian refugees, but kept in place a 120-day pause on all refugees and the 50,000 refugee quota.\n\n\"More than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\" Trump stated in the order.\n\nThe White House has said the ban will reduce the likelihood of terrorists slipping into the country and give the government time to devise a stronger vetting process for immigrants and refugees.\n\nBut detractors say it will hurt innocent refugees fleeing oppression and war, while damaging the United States' reputation as the world faces the worst refugee crisis in generations.\n\n\"The dynamic that people are missing is that this is all changing the way the outside world sees America,\" said Jose Mauricio Gaona, an O'Brien Fellow at the McGill University Centre for Human Rights & Legal Pluralism in Montreal. \"Decisions are being made about national values, and these suggest to the world that America is no longer a welcoming place for refugees.\"\n\nThe fight moved to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia last week, where Trump administration attorneys argued that the ban was legal against American Civil Liberties Union attorneys who said it specifically targeted Muslims in violation of the Constitution. Judges could issue an opinion any day, but the order will remain suspended because a federal judge in Hawaii issued a national halt on the 120-day refugee ban. The Trump administration appeal on that is expected to be heard this week in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle.\n\nWhile all that legal wrangling goes on, the refugee network in Allentown and nationwide limps along. Nationwide, the number of refugees admitted fell to 2,070 in March, the lowest monthly total since the government shutdown in 2013, according to State Department statistics. That was a direct result of the State Department's attempt to comply with Trump's order, reducing the refugee quota by 55 percent.\n\nWorld Relief, a Baltimore agency serving more than 7 million annually, announced in February it was laying off 140 workers and shuttering five refugee settlement centers. The U.S. government-funded Voice of America News reported two weeks ago that the travel ban has led refugee agencies to lay off 300 workers in the United States and 500 abroad.\n\nSell worries that even if the courts rule against Trump, the president, through his annual budget, can cap refugees at 50,000 a year without court approval, which would put the program at the lowest level since 2003. That tactic already has cut refugees in recent months, she said.\n\nBut Margo Schlanger, professor of law at the University of Michigan, said that too could ultimately be deemed illegal, if it's based on religious discrimination.\n\n\"Can the president slow it down? Undoubtedly yes,\" said Schlanger, the former head of civil rights for the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama. \"But I think the preliminary injunction in Hawaii has ruled the hard cap illegal if it's based on religious discrimination.\"\n\nIf the new quota stands, Trump says in the order that it would be in place, \"until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.\"\n\nLegal or not, the slowdown has hit hard in Allentown. The resettlement program in April had to lay off two of its five employees. The center had budgeted to receive 215 refugees in the federal fiscal year that started in October and was on pace to get close to that before the ban took effect. Allentown has received only seven refugees since February and because it's paid a flat administrative fee of $950 per refugee by the State Department its income has been limited almost entirely to the few donations the center gets.\n\nThat put Sell in the difficult position of having to let someone go. Caseworker Abbas Khalaf made it easier on her. He volunteered to be laid off. An Iraqi refugee who resettled here in 2010, Khalaf said he was so grateful for what the refugee program did for him, he was willing to do anything to help, even if it meant giving up his pay. He now is pursuing a computer technology career, beginning at Lehigh-Carbon Community College in the fall.\n\n\"The refugee program has helped me and my family so much,\" said Khalaf, who lives in Northampton. \"I will still volunteer at the center. It's so important to help. I'm not sure what I would have done without all the help I received.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-13", "authors": "Matt Assad", "type": "article"}
