That case, which originated in a Hawaii federal district court, also resulted in a block on Trump\u2019s 120-day pause on refugee resettlement.\n\nThe travel ban now is likely headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know before that happens.\n\nRachel Weaver protests against the travel ban outside the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 16 in Chicago.

Hawaii said the ban would hurt tourism and the state\u2019s university, which recruits from the six countries and has faculty who hail from them. Elshikh, a U.S. citizen, said in the suit that his mother-in-law had applied for a visa to travel to Hawaii to see the family before Trump became president. Elshikh said he fears that, under the travel ban, his mother-in-law couldn\u2019t see him. His suit said the ban stigmatized Muslims and created a perception that their religion was \u201cdisfavored.\u201d The Maryland case was brought by immigrants from Syria, Somalia and Iran whose families are in the middle of the visa approval process. It also was filed on behalf of groups that work with refugees. In that case, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center said the ban would prevent family reunification and discriminate on the basis of religion.\n\nA December 2015 file photo shows U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu. (George F. Lee / AP)\n\nLower-court judges have been scathing In Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson, an Obama appointee, said Trump appeared to violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution by discriminating against Muslims. As proof, Watson cited Trump\u2019s campaign promise to suspend Muslim immigration and his defense of his travel order as president. He pointed to an interview Trump gave to the Christian Broadcast Network in January after the first travel ban saying he would give preference to Christian refugees. That version of the travel order later was struck down in the courts and revised. \u201cThe illogic of the government\u2019s contention is palpable,\u201d Watson wrote in his opinion, rebutting government arguments that the travel ban didn\u2019t target Muslims. \u201cThe notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\u201d The opinion came out on March 15, the day before the revised travel ban was set to go into effect. Reacting to Watson while at a Nashville campaign rally, Trump said he preferred the original travel ban. He said the revised one was simply a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the old one. In his 43-page ruling, which landed March 16, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang said there were \u201cstrong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban.\u201d He said it was \u201clikely\u201d that Trump\u2019s ban violated the Constitution by discriminating against Muslims.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/825692045532618753\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827996357252243456\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/857177434210304001\n\nBut Trump\u2019s defense has stayed the same\n\nThe federal government says that Trump has wide authority over matters of national security and that his order was intended to prevent potential terrorists from getting into the United States.\n\nThe order cited two instances in which nationals from the targeted countries were part of terrorism in the U.S.\n\nIn January 2013, two Iraqis who came to the U.S. as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to life for terrorism-related activity. The new order, however, excluded Iraq from the ban.\n\nThe revised order also mentioned the case of a native of Somalia who was brought to the U.S. as a refugee. After later becoming a citizen, the immigrant was sentenced in 2014 to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction during a Christmas tree-lighting event in Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cIt would be far less disruptive to uniformity \u2014 and more respectful of the Constitution\u2019s allocation of authority over immigration to the political branches \u2014 to leave the order\u2019s nationwide policy in place, with individualized exceptions for any particular persons who plaintiffs demonstrate suffer cognizable and irreparable injury,\u201d government lawyers wrote in a brief to the 4th Circuit in April.\n\nGovernment lawyers also have argued that Trump\u2019s statements and those of his associates on suspending Muslim immigration shouldn\u2019t be used to judge the travel ban. Unlike the first ban, Trump\u2019s revised order does not refer to a person\u2019s status as a \u201creligious minority\u201d or mention any religion by name.\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in San Francisco on April 12, 2016.

They include states and cities, tech companies, former national security officials, universities and civil rights groups. In addition, at least 165 members of Congress have urged courts to keep blocking the ban. More groups have filed briefs against Trump\u2019s order than for it. The list below is a sampling of the filings from both sides.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP)\n\nLawyers have made their cases\n\nCareer attorneys from the Department of Justice faced off in May against civil rights lawyers fighting the travel ban. Many government attorneys are working on both appeals. The full list of attorneys for the cases is longer than what\u2019s below. Jeffrey B. Wall of the Department of Justice, Omar C.

(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut the decision rests with judges \u2014 and likely the Supreme Court\n\nIn an unusual move, nearly all 4th Circuit appeals court judges \u2014 instead of the usual three-judge panel \u2014 heard the travel ban case in the 4th Circuit in May. The full court is composed of 15 judges, the majority of whom were appointed by Democrats.\n\nBut two judges didn\u2019t participate. The most prominent Republican appointee to the court, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, recused himself because his son-in-law, Acting U.S. Solicitor Gen. Jeffrey B. Wall, represented Trump. Judge Allyson K. Duncan, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also did not join.\n\nIn its 10-3 majority opinion, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory said the travel order \u201cstands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question for this Court, distilled to its essential form, is whether the Constitution ... remains \u2018a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace,\u2019 \u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if so, whether it protects Plaintiffs\u2019 right to challenge an Executive Order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton appointed the three 9th Circuit judges who heard arguments in the Hawaii case on May 15. They were Judges Michael Hawkins and Ronald Gould, both considered to be moderates, and Richard Paez, who is viewed as liberal to moderate.\n\nThe court has not issued its opinion on the case, which looks not only at the travel ban but at Trump\u2019s attempt to block refugee resettlement for 120 days.\n\nLast month, the 9th Circuit rejected Hawaii\u2019s request for it to skip the three-judge panel and convene an 11-judge \u201cen banc\u201d panel to consider arguments over the travel ban. It did not provide any details about its reasoning.\n\njaweed.kaleem@latimes.com\n\nmaura.dolan@latimes.com\n\nUPDATES:\n\nMay 25, 12:45 a.m.: This article was updated with news of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against the travel ban.\n\nThis article was originally published at 12:15 p.m. on May 8.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem , Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
