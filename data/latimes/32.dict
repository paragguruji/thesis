The court offered limited examples, including students, \u201ca worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.\u201d\n\nIn guidelines issued Thursday, the Trump administration interpreted the order to allow entry of people with \"close family\u201d in the U.S., such as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling or in-law parents. It said people with employment and university admission would also qualify.\n\nBut it blocked grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers- and sisters-in-law.\n\nThat set the stage for a legal showdown over who qualifies as close family.\n\nLate Thursday, the state of Hawaii filed a motion in Honolulu\u2019s federal district court asking a judge who previously ruled against the travel ban to clarify whether the government\u2019s list of unqualified relatives violates the Supreme Court\u2019s order.\n\nGovernment officials said they based their interpretation on the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nBut Kevin Lapp, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the closest that law comes to defining \"close family\" is a section that describes \"immediate relatives\" as children younger than 21, spouses and parents. Those relatives get preference for visas, and the government went beyond that definition with the travel ban rules, he said.\n\nPeter Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, said that \u201cthe administration\u2019s definition of family is all over the place.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the immigration act doesn't allow preferential treatment for mothers- and fathers-in-law \u2014 who were included in the administration\u2019s definition of close relatives \u2014 but does give preference to fiances and fiancees \u2014 who were initially left off the list and then added in the final hour before the ban took effect.\n\nCaught in the confusion was U.S. citizen Afsaneh Shirazi, a 36-year-old software engineer who lives in San Francisco, whose fiance has been in Iran since November waiting for a visa.\n\nBefore the last-minute change, the couple had been thinking about moving to another country to be together.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard day and I am a bit relieved now,\u201d she said after it appeared her fiance would not be barred. \u201cI am still worried about administrative processing taking a long time.\u201d\n\nThe policy on refugees is another source of confusion.\n\nRefugees scheduled to arrive in the U.S. by July 6 will still be allowed entry. But it was unclear how the order would be applied to thousands of refugees who had been approved for travel but could not get flight reservations before that deadline.\n\nRefugee advocates argue that refugee agencies should be counted as bona fide U.S. connections, allowing resettlement to proceed. But the Trump administration said a refugee\u2019s relationship with a resettlement group by itself was not enough.\n\n\"Our understanding is that they are essentially shutting down refugee resettlement,\u201d said Justin Cox, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. \u201c... If we can't work this out, we will be back in court.\u201d\n\nCox is among a team representing immigrants and refugee groups in a case over the travel ban that the Supreme Court is expected to hear in the fall.\n\nThe court, which is also considering a similar case from Hawaii, indicated that its move to partially revive the ban was a temporary compromise before it heard full arguments. Plaintiffs have argued that the ban unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims.\n\nBut the matter could be moot by the fall, because Trump\u2019s executive order says the government needs 90 days to evaluate its vetting procedures before offering permanent proposals to hinder entry from terrorists.\n\nAmid questions about who would be let into the U.S., immigrant advocates dispatched volunteers overnight Thursday to international airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Washington and other cities.\n\n\"You have kids out of school who expected to see their grandparents this summer,\u201d said Camille Mackler, director of legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition, who was stationed at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \u201cYou have U.S. citizens who were planning to get married and can\u2019t bring over their fiances.\u201d\n\nMackler said she didn\u2019t expect a repeat of the \u201cdramatic scene\u201d that occurred in January when the original ban led to several days of deportations, detentions and thousands of visa cancellations before it was struck down in court.\n\nThe chaos led to dozens of lawsuits and months of rants from the president against district and circuit courts that ruled against him.\n\nTrump administration officials said that people who had visa appointments at embassies and consulates should still apply for travel and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. They also said consular officials, as before, would have the ability to waive restrictions in individual cases.\n\nImmigrant groups have continued to register their opposition to the ban. The National Iranian American Council said its implementation represented a \u201cnew low\u201d by \u201ctargeting grandparents of American children.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
