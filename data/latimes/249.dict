Kelly described plans for safeguards along the border that were more piecemeal than the \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d Trump has touted.\n\nKelly said his agency would first build sections of wall and fencing where border agents see an immediate need and fill in gaps with ground sensors, surveillance blimps and other technologies that help detect illegal border crossings, emphasizing that the government lives in \u201ca world of finite time [and] resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're not going to be able to build a wall everywhere all at once,\u201d Kelly told the House Homeland Security Committee, adding that Border Patrol agents told him they preferred barriers they could see through rather than a solid wall.\n\nBut Kelly also said measures for the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of travelers were under consideration that go further than visa officers ever have. The Homeland Security Department may demand that some visa applicants trying to enter legally hand over passwords to their social media accounts before flying to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to cooperate, they don\u2019t come in,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nIn three hours of testimony, Kelly filled in specifics on several national security goals Trump has broadly set. And like a soldier carrying out orders, Kelly, a retired Marine general, shouldered the blame for the haphazard rollout of the president\u2019s order temporarily blocking entry for refugees and all travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, even though he was largely left out of crafting the decree.\n\n\u201cThe thinking was to get it out quick so that potentially people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nIn retrospect, he said, \u201cI should have delayed it just a bit\u201d to prepare lawmakers and the public for the changes that were coming.\n\nThe confusion surrounding its implementation is \"all on me,\u201d Kelly said, putting himself in the awkward position of apologizing for the execution of a directive he didn\u2019t see until the week it was issued and wasn\u2019t told was coming until the day before it was signed.\n\nLive coverage: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals hearing over Trump's travel bans \u00bb\n\nThe writing of Trump\u2019s order was limited chiefly to a handful of senior White House advisors, including Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller, and agency lawyers. Lawmakers of both parties condemned the White House over its implementation.\n\nThe White House officials who directed the rollout should have come before the committee to \u201canswer for this debacle\u201d rather than Kelly, said Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the panel.\n\nEven committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who advised Trump on the travel restrictions during the transition and defended the president\u2019s decision to implement them, criticized how the directive was put into action.\n\n\u201cThe rollout of this executive order has been problematic. It has caused confusion here in Congress, across the country and around the world,\u201d McCaul said.\n\nHomeland Security officials were forced in the hours after the order was signed to scramble to issue instructions to border agents. Amid the uncertainty, some border agents blocked lawful permanent residents from entering the country.\n\nKelly defended his department's work and insisted that Customs and Border Protection officers were not to blame for the chaos that unfolded at airports, saying the turmoil was not in immigration lines but in arrival halls flooded with protesters and frustrated relatives of people blocked by the order.\n\nCivil liberties advocates and Democrats have criticized the president\u2019s order as unfairly targeting Muslims, pointing to Trump's repeated calls during the campaign to block Muslims from the U.S.\n\nA lawsuit attempting to overturn Trump\u2019s travel ban appeared to be on the fast track to the Supreme Court. Judges on the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Tuesday.\n\nTravelers from the countries targeted by Trump\u2019s temporary ban \u2014 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 have hurried to board flights to the U.S. during what might be a brief window to enter the country while the legal challenges play out.\n\nMcCaul was adamant the order didn't target a religious group. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban, and even the suggestion that it is will alienate our allies and embolden\u201d terrorists, he said.\n\nNonetheless, the administration is also looking at ways to step up background checks on citizens from the seven countries before they travel, such as demanding social media account passwords, Kelly said. Most of those nations have unreliable police forces or lack identity systems to help confirm travelers are who they say they are, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard to truly vet these people in these countries,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 27 order also required the Homeland Security Department to give him a list within 30 days of other countries that do not provide adequate information to border officials, but the agency has stopped work on that part of the order while the courts review it.\n\n\u201cThere is no additional list,\u201d Kelly said after the hearing.\n\nKelly also laid out for lawmakers the lengthy timeline needed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Kelly said he wanted to see construction of a wall \u201cwell underway\u201d within two years. Costs have been estimated at $12 billion to $38 billion.\n\nAnd echoing White House complaints, Kelly strongly denied a report in the Washington Post that Bannon had asked him to keep in place the temporary ban on green-card holders being allowed into the U.S.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
