The judge also stopped the government's attempt to cap refugee resettlement and the compiling of a series of government studies and reports on how refugees and foreign visitors to the U.S. are vetted.\n\nIn their Friday motion, government lawyers had asked Watson to revise his ruling to say it did not apply to the refugee ban or to the government studies and reports. Federal lawyers did not abandon their argument that Trump's executive order is constitutional but said the judge should limit his ruling to the six-country ban.\n\n\"The motion, in other words, asks the court to make a distinction that the federal defendants' previous briefs and arguments never did. As important, there is nothing unclear about the scope of the court's order\u2026. The federal defendants' motion is denied,\" Watson wrote on Sunday.\n\nIf Watson had granted the request, the Hawaii ruling would have largely matched a Maryland federal court order against the travel ban that was issued on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang. The Maryland judge declined to rule against the pause and cap on refugees.\n\nThe Department of Justice has appealed Chuang's decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. It could also appeal last week's Hawaii ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.\n\nThe original travel ban, signed Jan. 27, was blocked in federal district courts and the 9th Circuit. The new ban, signed March 6 and scheduled to go into effect March 16, was modified in an attempt to pass court muster.\n\nChanges in the new version included deleting Iraq from the list of countries whose travelers would be blocked and removing preferential treatment of refugees who were religious minorities.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
