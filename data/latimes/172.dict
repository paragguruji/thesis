The high-tech industry is heavily reliant upon such workers.\n\n\u201cI believe that we should have a program in which American workers are given jobs first,\u201d Miller said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have an open job in this country, a U.S. citizen or existing legal permanent resident ought to have the ability to make the first application for that job.\"\n\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, dealt a blow to the president's policies last week by refusing to reinstate his temporary ban on travel from seven mostly Muslim countries. The government has 14 days to respond to that decision.\n\nMiller said various legal scenarios were being weighed, including an appeal in the 9th Circuit or seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, you could pursue additional executive actions,\u201d said Miller, a principal author of the controversial travel ban. Administration officials indicated Friday that in the next few days, Trump could issue a new executive order, written to avoid the legal problems the current order has encountered.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we are pursuing every single possible action to keep our country safe from terrorism,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHe also renewed the White House attack on what the president and senior aides have characterized as overreach by the courts. Trump had earlier referred to James Robart, the U.S. District judge in Seattle who initially blocked enforcement of the travel ban, as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as judicial supremacy,\u201d Miller said in the NBC interview, adding that judges at both the district and appeals court level had taken \u201cpower for themselves that belong squarely in the hands of the president of the United States.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Laura King", "type": "article"}
