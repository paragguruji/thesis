Take care of the visa and we\u2019d figure out a way to see Metallica when he returned for the new semester in February.\n\nThat promise became far more complicated after President Trump signed an executive order on Friday that bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \u2014 even if they\u2019ve already been vetted and have a valid visa, as Abdullah has. For how long is anyone\u2019s guess as the details of this order seem to change by the hour and source. Is it 30 days? Ninety? Is it 120?
