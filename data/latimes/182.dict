Chuang. He declined to rule against the pause and cap on refugees.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice filed an appeal of Chuang's decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.\n\nThe Hawaii suit was brought by the state, which argued that its residents, businesses and universities were negatively affected by the travel ban. Lawyers representing Hawaii said Trump's executive order, signed March 6 and scheduled to go into effect March 16, was an extension of his campaign promise to suspend travel into the country by Muslims. The Maryland case, based on similar arguments, was brought by immigrants and nonprofit organizations that work with refugees.\n\nMarch's travel order was a revised version of a Jan. 27 travel ban that also included Iraq and gave preference to refugees who were religious minorities. The original ban was blocked in federal district courts and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nNone of the court orders on the travel ban are permanent. Instead, they halt it while more thorough court proceedings determine its constitutionality.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
