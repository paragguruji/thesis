But they have the ability to jam it up. And Tuesday they did just that.\n\nFirst they temporarily stopped the clock on Rex Tillerson\u2019s nomination for secretary of State, arguing that his views on Trump\u2019s refugee and travel ban must be made public before lawmakers can make a decision.\n\nNext they staged a walkout at the Senate Finance Committee, preventing votes on Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) as Health and Human Services secretary and Steve Mnuchin as secretary of Treasury.\n\nAnd they forced a delay of the Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general after Trump abruptly fired acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his travel ban.\n\nEarlier, they kept the Senate in session until midnight Monday and protested on the steps of the Supreme Court, ahead of what is now likely to be a rigorous confirmation battle over Trump\u2019s pick to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cPeople across our country are looking at what President Trump is doing, they are appalled, and they are looking to us in Congress to fight back,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 3 Democrat, whose office received so many voicemails of concern \u2013 10,000 \u2013 it shut down the system. \u201cDemocrats are fighting back with every tool we have.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said he would oppose every one of Trump\u2019s nominees until they fully answered new questions raised by Trump\u2019s executive actions.\n\nDemocrats were initially divided in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s stunning electoral victory over whether to work with the new president or battle him. Many remain crushed over Democratic losses and confused by the nationalist and populist enthusiasm for Trump that siphoned off some of their traditional voters.\n\nBut Democrats quickly found an answer in the protests erupting across the country as Americans poured into the streets after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and again last weekend at airports in response to the travel order.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama kind of set the tone when he left saying to everybody, \u2018If you want to make an impact, stay engaged,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). \u201cThe public\u2019s very engaged.\u201d\n\nEven some Democratic organizers were pleasantly surprised by the scale of the impromptu rallies of liberals, carrying homemade signs and showing up to protest the president\u2019s actions. To some, the uprisings have been reminiscent of the tea party protests that sprung up early in Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nSenate leaders say that their reasons for stalling Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices are based on policy, not politics. They note that the Senate easily confirmed Elaine Chao as the new Transportation secretary Tuesday while committees advanced Rick Perry as Energy secretary and Ryan Zinke as head of Interior.\n\nBut some of Trump\u2019s nominees remain controversial because they have not completed the necessary paperwork, including ethics disclosures, or they face fresh questions as new information emerges.\n\nDemocrats have said Mnuchin, a wealthy Wall Street executive, misled the committee in his response to a written question about foreclosures at Pasadena\u2019s OneWest Bank while he ran it from 2009 to 2015.\n\nThey have also been increasingly critical of Price\u2019s extensive trading in healthcare stocks while he has been in Congress, in some cases while he has pushed legislation that would benefit his portfolio.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) denounced the Democratic walkout Tuesday as he sat with only Republicans on the dais.\n\n\"They ought to be embarrassed. It's the most pathetic treatment I\u2019ve seen in my 40 years in the United States Senate,\" Hatch said. \"I think they should stop posturing and acting like idiots.\"\n\nBut even Democrats who did not participate in the boycott Tuesday said their colleagues had the right to protest for more information.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who communicated with protesters via Skype at his Charleston office.\n\nFor Democrats the unresolved tension between the party\u2019s liberal base and its more moderate wing remains a potentially troublesome political divide. The rise of the tea party, for example, may have reenergized the GOP, but it also fueled deep divisions that continue today.\n\nLiberal favorite Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) encountered pushback from liberal activists after she voted to advance Ben Carson\u2019s nomination for Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\n\u201cThere are various gradations within the opposition, and some [advocate] scorched-earth,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the assistant leader. \u201cSome of my folks in the base don\u2019t want me to vote yes for anyone. But I\u2019m not going to take that position.\u201d\n\nAfter Democrats gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday night in an emotional protest over the refugee and travel ban, Trump tweeted dismissively about them. He made fun of the trouble they had getting the microphones to work.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "article"}
