{"title": "Frank Harris III: A Trump Travel Ban That Might Just Work", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/politics/hc-op-harris-trump-travel-ban-variation-0518-20170517-column.html", "text": "Dear America \u2014 I enthusiastically support a Trump travel ban.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nWhen King Donald travels out of the country for his first foreign trip, I propose we ban his return.\n\nYes, ban our president from setting foot on American soil again.\n\nIf he tries to fly in, turn his jet around. If he tries to sail in, turn his yacht around. If he tries to walk in, take his money and run and build a great wall around America to turn Trump's rump around.\n\nDoing so will remove the biggest threat to America's democracy, security and health. It's not the Muslims or the Mexicans who are the biggest threat. It's Donald J. Trump.\n\nHe threatens our democracy with his authoritarian way of running the country. He awards positions to family members. He labels the news media as the enemy of the people. He fosters divisiveness by scapegoating groups. He demands loyalty to him and not America. He seeks to stifle criticism and dissent. He places himself above America and above the law.\n\nBan Donald Trump from America. He is a national security risk.\n\nHe clearly is no refrigerator \u2014 he can't keep anything. If he doesn't tweet it, he speaks it. Loudly. Stupidly. Bigly.\n\nWhether through intent or accident, he reportedly shared classified information with the Russians and now tries to give it a reason. Is it not treason?\n\nDid he not suggest Hillary Clinton should be locked up for using her private email server to transmit classified documents? Did he not say she was reckless and irresponsible and put American lives in danger? Did not his supporters call for her impeachment should she be elected president?\n\nTrump never thought he'd be president, but he is and he has displayed an incompetence and dishonesty that has led to a distrust of his words and the words of his surrogates. As president, he has embodied the dubious qualities he heaped upon perceived enemies and adversaries: the \"false\" and \"fake\" of the mainstream news media, the \"lying\" of Ted Cruz, the \"crooked\" of Hillary Clinton.\n\nShould we then prevent the false, fake, lying, crooked King Trump from leaving the country lest he suddenly stray from his planned visit and run straight into the arms of the Russians to divulge more secrets?\n\nI say \"no.\" Let him go. Addition by subtraction.\n\nOur health as a nation will be better without the daily stress from the mess he creates and perpetuates during the reality show that is the Trump administration. It is a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, unscripted, live reality show starring Donald Trump as president. Each day brings a new plot tweet and revelation that feeds the cable news networks' hosts and panelists, followed by another Sean Spicer press conference and more tweets capped off by the late-night comics led by Stephen Colbert speaking truth to power through comedy.\n\nYou gotta laugh at this stuff until you realize the truth ain't so funny once this president places comedians on the list alongside journalists as the co-enemies of the American people.\n\nIt's an American tragedy happening in real time. We are living it. Breathing it. Many may die because of it \u2014 whether it is from a dangerous new proposed health care bill, a reckless miscalculation with a foreign country or the stoking of racial, religious, ethnic and political fears in America.\n\nWhat will be next? Who will be next? If fired FBI Director James Comey said \"no\" to Trump's loyalty pledge, who said \"yes\"? Was Trump taping, was he not? Did he obstruct justice? Should he be impeached?\n\nTrumpty Dumpty is having a great fall. A series of great falls. Yet, Trumpty's surrogates keep propping him back upon the wall.\n\nI say ban Donald Trump from returning to America. He will be happier in Russia. He will have a press that will not question him, comedians who will not joke about him and a people who will not question the attack upon their freedom.\n\nRussia. If you are reading this. Take your comrade \u2014 please.\n\nFrank Harris III of Hamden is a professor of journalism at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. His email address is frankharristhree@gmail.com.
