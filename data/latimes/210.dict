{"title": "Trump's travel ban and how ordinary people become monsters", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/bs-ed-immigration-20170208-story.html", "text": "I was very surprised to read of the unprofessional behavior of federal immigration employees working to carry out President's Donald Trump's travel ban at U.S. airports (\"Ordinary Americans carried out inhumane acts for Trump,\" Feb. 6).\n\nI am a retired Customs and Border Protection officer who worked at BWI Airport for 30 years. During that time we had strict guidelines on how to treat people in our custody with respect. We also had separate guidelines on the treatment of minors, with emphasis on their age and family.\n\nThe examples of behavior by federal employees that Mr. Edelson describes, if true, were just not the way we were trained to act when there was a custody issue.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Edelson read Daniel Goldhagen's book \"Hitler's Willing Executioners.\" I hope then he might get the proper perspective on how ordinary people could carry out inhumane acts in the name of a despicable leader such as Hitler.\n\nBrad Feig, Pikesville", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "Baltimore Sun", "type": "article"}
