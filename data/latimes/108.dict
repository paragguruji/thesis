Clifton, shown in 2002, Judge William Canby, shown in 2015, and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, shown in 2014, serve on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nFor several consecutive minutes during Washington Solicitor Gen. Noah Purcell's arguments at the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, judges repeatedly prodded Purcell on whether President Trump's travel ban amounted to anti-Muslim discrimination.\n\n\"The seven countries encompass only a relatively small percentage of Muslims,\" Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said at one point.\n\n\"I have trouble understanding where we're supposed to infer religious animus,\" said Clifton.\n\nDuring the arguments, Clifton asked Purcell how the ban could be seen as anti-Muslim if it affected only a subset of Muslims.\n\n\"To prove religious discrimination we do not need to prove this order harms only Muslims \u2026 or every Muslim,\" said Purcell, pointing to the president's past public statements on a \"Muslim ban\" and preference for Christian refugees.\n\nClifton asked if the travel ban was the specific \"shutdown\" of all Muslim immigration that Trump had promised during his campaign.\n\n\"No,\" said Purcell.\n\nUpdated at 5:05 p.m .: An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed a comment about religious animus to Judge William Canby. It was Judge Richard Clifton who made the remark.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
