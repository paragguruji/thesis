But the decision effectively ends a 20-year U.S. economic embargo against Sudan.\n\nIt will improve that country's diplomatic ties with Washington and allow the unfreezing of Sudanese assets.\n\nThe Trump administration also recently removed Sudan from its controversial travel ban.\n\n\"We see this as an important milestone,\" said the U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in keeping with State Department procedures.\n\nBut the official said Sudan still needs to make up ground to completely rejoin the world community. U.S. officials will closely monitor whether Sudan continues to prevent terrorists from transiting its territory, eases deliveries of humanitarian aid and cooperates in regional security efforts.\n\nAs a separate part of the deal, the Sudanese government pledged not to pursue the importation of any weapons from North Korea, the official said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-07", "authors": "Tracy Wilkinson", "type": "article"}
