But government lawyers said they did not seek a reconsideration of the decision because a revamped executive order is in the works.\n\nThat new order would supersede the old one, lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment lawyers said the appeals court should vacate its prior decision when the new executive order is issued.\n\nStill, Trump defended the original order when speaking to reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"We had a very smooth rollout... but we had a bad court,\" Trump said. He said the new order will be \"very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad [court] decision.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem and Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
