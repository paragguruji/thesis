We\u2019ve always been blessed with the reliability of the laws in this country, and that\u2019s been shaken the past couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nL.A. painter Amir H. Fallah, who\u2019s part of Advocartsy\u2019s multimedia exhibition opening Feb. 10, \u201cArt Brief III: The (Un)Draped Woman,\u201d said he\u2019s felt \u201ca little relieved\u201d since the ban was lifted, but he\u2019s \u201cstill skeptical.\u201d Fallah, the father of an 18-month-old, said the executive order, even if it\u2019s never reinstated, has interfered with his family relations back in Iran.\n\n\u201cI have two elderly grandmothers in Iran who have U.S. visas,\u201d he said, \u201cand they will probably never come back to America again \u2014 the journey is already so difficult for them, they\u2019re in wheelchairs, and they can\u2019t risk that headache. They don\u2019t want to take the risk and then get turned around. It means my grandmothers won\u2019t get to meet their great-grandson, which is depressing.\u201d\n\nPhotographer Hadi Salehi, who also has work in the \u201c(Un)Draped Woman\u201d exhibition, echoes that sentiment.\n\n\u201cI have a 15-year-old niece and was planning to bring her here this summer from Iran,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen now. That sort of shattered my dream. I\u2019m not too optimistic things will stay like this; I hope so. I am worried that the travel ban will come back.\u201d\n\nStill, Salehi \u2014 who is 66 and immigrated to L.A. in 1978 \u2014 said he makes an effort every day to be positive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy living in America,\u201d he said, \u201cjust being Iranian and different. Sometimes there\u2019s racism. But I love America, to tell you the truth. I really do.\u201d\n\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei CAPTION L.A.
