Purcell, center, and state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson, right, sued against the first travel ban.\n\nThe attorney general of Washington state, whose case against President Trump's initial travel ban brought that planl to a halt, said Monday that his office is considering its \"next legal steps\" concerning the administration's new travel order.\n\n\"By rescinding his earlier executive order, President Trump makes one thing perfectly clear: His original travel ban was indefensible \u2014 legally, constitutionally and morally,\" Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe president has capitulated on numerous key provisions blocked by our lawsuit, including bans on Green Card holders, visa holders and dual citizens, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees, and explicit preferences based on religion,\" he said. \"We are carefully reviewing the new executive order to determine its impacts on Washington state and our next legal steps.\"\n\nFerguson said he would have more to say later Monday.\n\nAfter Washington and Minnesota sued against the first travel ban in a Seattle federal court, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart issued a national restraining order on Feb. 3 blocking its enforcement until the constitutionality of the order could be decided. That restraining order was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the administration challenged it.\n\nIn response to those rulings, Trump said the new executive order would be \"tailored\" to the \"bad\" decisions .\n\nThe Seattle case is still pending.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
