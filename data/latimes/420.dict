Rodman, president of Writers Guild of America, in a joint statement.\n\n\"The Writers Guilds of America, East and West condemn Donald Trump\u2019s profoundly un-American \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 and applaud the federal court\u2019s decision to grant a stay that will keep those being held at American airports from being forcibly returned to their countries. Human rights \u2013 including the freedoms of speech and religion \u2013 are essential to all Americans and to all who come here to build better lives,\" said Winship and Rodman.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Friday suspending refugee arrivals and banning entry to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran and Syria.\n\nIn response to the ban, Farhadi stated Sunday that he would not be attending the Academy Awards ceremony as \"condemnation of the unjust conditions forced upon some of my compatriots.\"\n\n\"We are especially troubled by reports that Asghar Farhadi, director of 'The Salesman,' which won Best Screenplay at Cannes and is now nominated for an Oscar, may together with his cast and crew be prevented from entering our country,\" Winship and Rodman stated. \"From its early days, the entertainment industry has been built by the imagination of immigrants. Our guilds are unions of storytellers who have always welcomed those from other nations, and of varying beliefs, who wish to share their creativity with America. We are grateful to them, we stand with them, we will fight for them.\u201d\n\nThe travel ban also means that the Syrian Civil Defense volunteers who served as the subjects of Academy Award-nominated documentary short \" The White Helmets \" will also be unable to attend the ceremony.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
