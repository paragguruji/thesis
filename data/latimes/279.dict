They won\u2019t let you into America.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many rules,\u201d he said, laughing to ease his nerves. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\nIt was true, the part about so many rules. The fate of Abdullah\u2019s trip, and his future as a student in the U.S., was changing by the hour thanks to the confusion sown by President Trump\u2019s executive order on travel and the multiple rulings against it.\n\nAbdullah Al-Rifaie, 19, has lived in Southern California for the last year and a half, attending classes on a student visa. He left Los Angeles in December on winter break to renew his visa \u2014 to follow the rules. But in the few weeks it took for him to successfully get his paperwork processed in Jordan, Trump signed the executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, including the one that issued Abdullah\u2019s passport, Iraq.\n\nThe order had an immediate effect on the travel plans of Abdullah and many far more desperate than him \u2014 refugees and asylum seekers whose lives were in danger in their home countries.\n\nMy sisters, my mom and an attorney who offered her services pro bono when she heard of Abdullah\u2019s plight tried to keep abreast of the rapidly changing news.\n\nOn Thursday, the situation looked bad. He should stay in Jordan for now, the lawyer advised.\n\nOn Friday: Good news. A Boston judge issued a temporary restraining order against the travel ban. Visa holders from other countries on the list \u2014 Iran, Yemen \u2014 are getting in, we\u2019re told, he should get here now while he can!\n\nBut later on Friday, things had changed again. Hold up, Abdullah was told. Valid visa holders are still being detained at U.S. airports and sent back to where they came from. Stay put.\n\nThis cycle of hope and doom, hope and doom, repeated itself in what seemed like a prolonged and cruel game of emotional ping pong. Even if Abdullah had gone to the airport, there was a slim-to-zero chance the airline would let him on a U.S.-bound plane. Footage of Yemeni and Syrian nationals stranded at airports all over the world told us as much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss school,\u201d he said last week when things looked their most grim. \u201cDo you think I should start applying to study in England or Canada? I\u2019ll have to start all over again.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the Metallica factor.\n\nMy pop-culture-obsessed nephew had already missed seeing his favorite metal band by two days when he left in December and, if the ban held, he\u2019d miss them again when they play L.A. next week. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone\u2019s trying to keep us apart,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly Saturday morning it looked as if the most recent restraining order on the travel ban was being honored at most U.S. airports. Abdullah decided to fly in on the return ticket to LAX he\u2019d booked almost a year ago.\n\nHis lawyer advised him to keep in touch with her every leg of the flight. Once he landed, she instructed him to not sign anything other than the routine customs form. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re detained for questioning, be cooperative and polite,\u201d she said, \u201cbut tell them you also have a lawyer waiting outside at the arrival gate.\u201d\n\nAs my family, the lawyer and some dedicated friends stood at the international arrival gate at LAX, we overheard an immigration attorney explaining to an Iranian man near us that the woman he was waiting for, a student-visa holder, had been pulled for a secondary interview.\n\nWhat if Abdullah was detained by customs border agents, or denied entry altogether and sent back?\n\nMy sister said she felt like she was going to throw up. My other sister said she should aim the other way because she wasn\u2019t about to repeat the same gross scenario that happened in the family station wagon when they were kids. My mom was too preoccupied scanning the arriving travelers to notice her girls were squabbling, again.\n\nThe lawyer warned us that Abdullah would likely be detained as well, but we just had to be patient. We\u2019d be there a while.\n\nBut there were signs of hope. One traveler emerged to a greeting of cameras and well-wishers holding balloons and welcome-home signs.\n\nI suddenly realized, we had no signs or balloons.\n\nAt a nearby folding table set up as a makeshift office by volunteer immigration lawyers, I borrowed a Sharpie pen and paper to scrawl out a sign: \u201cAbdullah. Metallica Rules! Welcome back.\u201d\n\nWithin the hour, he miraculously appeared.\n\nRobert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times Abdullah Al-Rifaie arrives at LAX during a pause in the Trump administration travel ban.

(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFor the first time since I\u2019ve known him, my young and easygoing nephew appeared worn and nervous. He was sweating and poker faced when he walked out the automatic doors and up the ramp with his luggage. It wasn\u2019t until he saw us in the crowd that he seemed to realize the ordeal was over.\n\nScreams and tears and hugs, cheers from strangers, cameras flashing, reporters asking questions. He\u2019d made it through, no questions asked. The months of vetting he\u2019d gone through to get his American visa apparently meant something again.\n\nRobert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times Abdullah Al-Rifaie is greeted by family at LAX on Sunday during a court stay of the Trump administration's executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.

(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhen we were finally outside and walking to the car, he exhaled.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally here.\u201d\n\nIt was then he unzipped his sweat jacket, revealing the image on his T-shirt: Johnny Cash flipping the bird.\n\n\u201cDude!\u201d my husband said. \u201cWhat if they\u2019d pulled you into secondary questioning, and asked you to take off your jacket. What would you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t even think about that,\u201d Abdullah said. Oh, to be 19.\n\n\u201cI guess I would just tell them the truth,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Johnny Cash fan.\u201d\n\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A.
