Even as his allies insist he is not instituting a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d Trump\u2019s own attempts to sell the policy as just that may prove its undoing.\n\nUnlike conventional politicians, who use careful language to leave themselves room to slip and slide away from their promises, Trump repeatedly employs the type of sizzling sales pitches he learned in real estate and media.\n\n\u201cA typical White House doesn\u2019t need to finesse because they have a president who understands that technique already,\u201d said Frank Luntz, who has spent decades advising Republicans in the art of using rhetoric to frame debates. \u201cFinesse and Donald Trump are not two words you use in the same sentence. But you always have to put in the \u2018but.\u2019 This has worked for him.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s sloganeering remains a valuable tool for rallying support for his ideas. But as the late Mario Cuomo might have said, Trump is fast learning what it\u2019s like to campaign in marketing and govern in prose.\n\nAll presidents face that reality, usually when they balance campaign promises against the realities of complicated policy, bureaucratic resistance and Congress. But for Trump, who once vowed to fulfill \u201cevery dream you\u2019ve ever dreamed,\u201d the drop-off could be steeper.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was not just a bad idea to Trump. It was a \u201cdisaster,\u201d a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d that if not repealed and replaced \u201cwill destroy American healthcare forever.\u201d\n\nDespite the urgency he conveyed on the campaign trail, Trump said this week that it may take another year to replace Obamacare.\n\nAlmost everyone has heard the call-and-response climax of a Trump campaign rally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build the wall,\u201d he says. And who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? \u201cMexico!\u201d the crowd roars.\n\nBut Trump has yet to outline specifics on how to compel Mexico to pay for it against the country\u2019s will. He is now asking Congress to at least initially pay for a wall, which Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly described Tuesday as partial.\n\nTrump has also backed off his pledge to prosecute election opponent Hillary Clinton, whom he had branded as \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d and he continues to heap praise on former President Obama, whose birth certificate he long questioned as \u201ca fraud.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s the travel ban on immigration that faces the most immediate test.\n\nTrump initially proposed a temporary \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d in December 2015. In the months since, he adopted the media shorthand of \u201cban\u201d as his own.\n\nThe final executive order, issued a week after Trump\u2019s inauguration, fell short of a full Muslim ban, suspending entrance for asylum seekers from around the world as well as inbound travel for citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nJust before signing it, Trump said in a radio interview that Christians fleeing persecution from Syria would get preferential treatment once refugees are allowed in, adding to the sense that he was initiating a religious test.\n\nOnce opponents began filing legal challenges that attacked the order as religious discrimination, White House aides began distancing themselves from the word \u201cban,\u201d even when it was not used in conjunction with the word \u201cMuslim.\u201d\n\nPress Secretary Sean Spicer chided the media for using the term, insisting that Trump was only using it because the media was calling it a ban, a contorted explanation that inspired a biting sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nBy the time Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway appeared on CNN on Tuesday just before crucial appellate arguments, she had sterilized the order to \u201cextreme vetting from seven narrowly prescribed countries in a very temporary way.\u201d\n\nSelling a major policy in such clinical terms is never easy. But it might have been easier to recast Trump\u2019s executive order if the initial sales job were not so vivid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like just a speech,\u201d said Peter Hart, a Democrat who owns a political research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s something he continually reinforced.\u201d\n\nObama, a far more cautious politician, had several memorable phrases that came back to bite him, including a \u201cred line\u201d he drew against Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons that he failed to enforce, and a false promise that Americans who liked their health insurance plans could keep them under Obamacare.\n\nHart noted that Trump, less than a month in office, already \u201chas used a half a dozen phrases that every American can probably recite.\u201d\n\nBut Hart, like others in his field, believes Trump\u2019s ability to brand is \u201ca modern miracle\u201d that has already proven a big benefit. And the costs may not prove fatal. Trump has shown a keen ability to distract from setbacks by causing more controversies.\n\nAnd while Trump\u2019s low approval ratings have set records for a new president, his core backers, who have largely stuck with him, tend to view his slogans as opening negotiating positions rather than as hard-and-fast commitments.\n\n\u201cAny other politician would already have been punished for what looks like a retreat from stated policies,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican communications consultant who advised Mitt Romney. \u201cBut many of Trump's most ardent supporters give him more leeway since they are more accustomed to Trump, the celebrity businessman from \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 than they are Trump the politician.\u201d\n\nTrump views his branding prowess as an indispensable weapon. He references the \u201clying and dishonest media\u201d at every turn, calls his club in Florida the \u201cwinter White House\u201d and ends many of his speeches and news releases with some form of the phrase \u201cMake America great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel it; it\u2019s an instinct,\u201d he told the New York Times Magazine last year in an interview in which he described his spelling for \u201cLiddle Marco\u201d Rubio, his insulting nickname for the Florida senator whom he defeated in the Republican primary.\n\nEven at rallies, Trump would dwell on the significance of saying the nicknames just right. Never \u201cLying Ted,\u201d he told audiences while insulting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, another Republican primary rival. \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted!\u201d he insisted, reveling in applause as he emphasized the missing consonant.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
