Ryan on Tuesday stood by President Trump's temporary ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations and indicated that he was confident the administration could fix the \"confusing\" rollout without action from Congress.\n\n\"What is happening is something we support,\" said Ryan, whose office was the target of a sit-in by protesters opposed to Trump's order. \"We need to pause and we need to make sure that the vetting standards are up to snuff so we can guarantee the safety and security of our country.\"\n\nCongress was blindsided by Trump's executive action -- Ryan learned about it as the public did when the White House announced it Friday afternoon. Many GOP lawmakers have raised concerns.\n\nDuring a private meeting in the Capitol basement Tuesday, Republican lawmakers were counseled on how to handle protesters and office sit-ins happening across the country.\n\n\"It\u2019s regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this,\" Ryan said. \"No one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this.\"\n\nRyan also said he was concerned the ban could be used as propaganda by terrorist groups.\n\n\"The rhetoric surrounding this could be used as a recruiting tool, and I think that's dangerous,\" he said.\n\nStill, Republicans leaders as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers largely agreed with the president's move to halt refugee admissions for 120 days, and to temporarily ban citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, unless they are Christians or other religious minorities.\n\n\"The president was well within his right to issue an executive order,\" said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the House Rules Committee.\n\n\"Do I feel let out? I feel like everybody was left out,\" he said. \"I wish they communicated it. I wish they had gotten more information to people. I wish they had measured three times and sawed once.\"\n\nLawmakers have shown little appetite for Congress to get involved, and suggested the chaos that erupted at airports over the weekend was just part of a learning curve at the White House.\n\n\u201cI support the thrust of the executive order,\" said Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), who nevertheless said the administration should have been better prepared and will need to \"get your act together.\"\n\nLast year, Ryan had strongly condemned Trump's campaign-trail call for a Muslim ban.\n\nIn recent days, Ryan, like other congressional leaders, was forced to dial up the administration with his questions and concerns about the order, conferring Monday with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\n\"I am very pleased and confident that he is, on a going-forward basis, going to make sure that things are done correctly,\" Ryan said.\n\nPressed on whether Congress would have a role, Ryan did not indicate any immediate legislative action.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "article"}
