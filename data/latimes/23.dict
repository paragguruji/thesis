The lawyers said they plan to assess any impact on travelers who are seeking entry into the United States through Customs and Border Protection at LAX.\n\nThey were joined by a handful of activists holding signs that read, \u201cNo! Stop Trump/Pence\u201d outside Tom Bradley International Terminal.\n\nAlhaj, who immigrated to the U.S. 15 years ago, brought copies of her mother\u2019s immigration paperwork to the airport just in case.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s from one of the six countries,\u201d Alhaj said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s going to be an issue.\u201d\n\nAmeena Mirza Qazi, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, said people are still \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the travel ban, even in the restricted form allowed earlier this week by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of confusion about how this affects people, how this affects family members,\u201d Qazi said. \u201cThe [visa] process is already so thorough and it\u2019s been that way for a very long time. To say someone can\u2019t come in because they\u2019re from a certain country\u2026we know what this is about. This is about excluding Muslims as much as possible.\u201d\n\nQazi said attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild and other organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the ACLU, will monitor the way customs officials treat travelers.\n\nAround 6 p.m., Qazi said she hadn\u2019t noticed any significant impact on travelers. Still, she said, attorneys are monitoring flights from places such as France and Germany, where travelers who started from the Middle East catch connecting flights to the U.S., as well as flights from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cToday is a lot more waiting and seeing. In January, we actively knew of people being detained,\u201d she said.\n\nExtra police officers were not called in Thursday, but a \u201cvery large contingency\u201d of officers is always on call to respond to major incidents, the Los Angeles Airport Police Department said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said officers expected \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\n\nAfter the ban stalled for several months in federal courts, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed much of the ban to take effect while also applying significant restrictions that narrow the order\u2019s impact.\n\nWith exceptions for people with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to schools, employers, family or other U.S. entities, the ban will block admission of people from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days as the government evaluates its vetting procedures.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that it needs the travel pause while it reviews and revises its vetting procedures for people arriving from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Trump has argued that the countries have ties to terrorism and that the ban will better protect the country against terror attacks.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the Trump administration created relationship guidelines, which explain who is exempted from the ban. The guidelines, which were sent to embassies and consulates around the globe, do not count grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law or other extended family members as \u201cclose\u201d relations whose presence in the U.S. would allow people blocked by the travel ban to still enter the country. Visas that have already been approved will not be revoked.\n\nJust before 4:30 p.m., Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer stopped by the makeshift legal clinic at the airport on his way to a meeting with LAX Port Director Mitch Merriam.\n\n\u201cI have very strong concerns about the definition the State Department has given for \u2018bona fide\u2019 relationships here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to learn more about the ways the federal government is evaluating who gets in.\u201d\n\nFeuer said he was troubled that the Trump administration in January also sought 90 days \u2014 which have since expired \u2014 to assess the efficacy of its vetting procedures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well past that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nShayan Modarres, legal counsel for the National Iranian American Council, said the ban represented a \u201cnew low\u201d by \u201ctargeting grandparents of American children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of heartbreak, a lot of sadness and confusion,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say that somebody\u2019s grandparents present a national security threat or a risk to the U.S. underscores how absurd this Muslim ban really is.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
