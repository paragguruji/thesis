But it gives ammunition to government lawyers arguing for the ban across several U.S. courts where cases against it are pending.\n\nThe Hawaii and Maryland rulings agreed with arguments that the travel ban violated the Constitution by discriminating against Muslims. The judges cited statements by Trump and his campaign associates about restricting Muslim travel to the U.S. as evidence of their intent to single out followers of Islam.\n\nTrenga\u2019s opinion gave less weight to Trump\u2019s statements. It more strictly looked at how the travel ban is worded in light of presidential power over immigration and national security.\n\nThe judge highlighted the changes made to narrow the scope of the travel ban after an initial version of the order was struck down by federal courts in January and February. Changes in the new version included omitting Iraq from the list of countries whose travelers would be blocked and removing preferential treatment of refugees who were religious minorities.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which is defending the Trump administration in court, hailed Trenga\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is pleased with the ruling,\u201d department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. \u201cAs the Court correctly explains, the president\u2019s executive order falls well within his authority to safeguard the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nThe original travel ban, signed Jan. 27, was halted by federal district courts and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The new ban, signed March 6 and scheduled to go into effect March 16, was modified in an attempt to pass court muster.\n\nThe Maryland ruling stopped the revised executive order\u2019s 90-day ban on travel into the U.S. by citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe Hawaii ruling went a step further by also blocking a 120-day pause on refugee resettlement from any country. It also blocked the government\u2019s attempt to cap refugee resettlement and the compiling of a series of government studies and reports on how refugees and foreign visitors to the U.S. are vetted.\n\nThose rulings, as well as the one Friday in Virginia, are not final but temporary decisions on the travel ban as the cases over its constitutionality proceed.\n\nThe Department of Justice has appealed the Maryland decision to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals but has not appealed in the Hawaii case.\n\nTrump has said he wants to take arguments over the travel ban to the Supreme Court.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
