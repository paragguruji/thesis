Implementation of the order \u2014 which was rolled out in January and updated in March after court challenges \u2014 is still stalled by legal proceedings. But if the regulation were to be enacted it would mean that a maximum of 7,586 additional refugees could be resettled through September, the end of the federal fiscal year.\n\nThe president\u2019s order also calls for barring all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days unless their travel is formally approved by the State Department.\n\nThe Obama administration had wanted to increase the refugee intake from 85,000 to 110,000 this fiscal year.\n\nCalifornia, Texas and New York resettled the most refugees in fiscal 2016, taking a combined total of 20,738 people, or about a quarter of the U.S. total, according to Pew data. So far this year, these states are among those that have seen the biggest drop in refugee arrivals, Connor said.\n\nFor example, 1,096 refugees were resettled Texas in October, but that number plummeted to 353 in April, according to the report. California and Arizona both had over 450 fewer refugee arrivals in April than in October. And the refugee intake for California this month was 249 as of Wednesday, Connor said.\n\n1,096 814 563 560 547 353 338 168 498 443 362 336 182 194 115 112 179 87 Number of refugees in decline Most U.S. states saw monthly decreases in the number of refugees resettled. Here are the top states in fiscal year 2016-17, which started on Oct. 1.

April Oct. April Oct. April\n\nLos Angeles County, a leading destination for refugees, resettled only 96 people in March, down from 242 in January, according to State Department data.\n\nNew York and Michigan, among the top four states for refugee resettlement last year, have also recorded \u201csubstantial drops in monthly refugee resettlement\u201d this fiscal year.\n\nArkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana were the only states to register higher numbers of refugees in April than in October.\n\nExperts said the U.S. had been on track to reach the Obama administration\u2019s target of admitting 110,000 this fiscal year, taking in more than 25,000 refugees between October and December, according to the State Department.\n\nBut then came Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at halting refugee resettlement and banning travel from seven (later six) Muslim-majority countries. Although federal courts halted the president\u2019s executive order, the rulings did not affect the cap of 50,000 refugees. The result: the admission of refugees was reduced to a trickle.\n\nOnly 842 refugees entered the country the week after Trump signed first travel ban. Before that the U.S. was admitting about 2,000 refugees a week. That number subsequently declined to about 400 a week, but was increased to 900 in April, the State Department reported.\n\nLater court orders on Trump\u2019s second executive order on travel and refugees essentially lifted the 50,000-person cap. But the sluggish pace of resettlement remains.\n\nState Department and Homeland Security officials have significantly cut down on interviews with would-be refugees, according to resettlement agencies.\n\n\u201cInterviews with refugee applicants are not happening as a rule anymore; it is happening as an exception,\u201d said Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy with the Church World Service, a refugee resettlement charity. \u201cAfter the first travel ban, we stopped seeing interviews being scheduled. People who were in the pipeline were being told their interviews were canceled, and we started seeing more of this and it emerged as a pattern.\u201d\n\nHuman rights groups have decried the proposed closure of the U.S. border to refugees and blame Trump\u2019s executive order for the decline in new arrivals, which they said was having a debilitating impact on those still wanting to come to the U.S.\n\n\u201cPeople are finding themselves really at a loss,\u201d said Noah Gottschalk, a Washington-based senior humanitarian policy advisor for Oxfam America. \u201cThey\u2019re thrown back into limbo with the same sense of insecurity. Many had started believing that they were on their way to a better life in the U.S., and that hope has been fading as they have seen what is happening.\u201d\n\nMartin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Los Angeles, said the nongovernmental organization was \u201cprofoundly concerned about refugees who have to wait longer and suffer more deprivation while they wait to resettle.\u201d\n\nZogg said the government\u2019s stance on refugees was also causing anxiety among those already resettled in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere are reports of refugees being reluctant to apply for services that they are entirely eligible for because they don\u2019t want anything to have a negative impact on their status here,\u201d Zogg said.\n\nThe decline in the number of refugees is also negatively affecting organizations that assist the newcomers. \u201cA lot of NGOs have had to lay off a significant number of staff,\u201d said Gottschalk.\n\nAt least 300 personnel working for such resettlement agencies have been laid off nationwide, according to humanitarian officials.\n\nZogg said World Relief had suspended its resettlements in Orange Count and Catholic Charities had closed their offices in San Bernardino.\n\nJust how many refugees might resettle in the United States this year is uncertain given the ongoing legal battles over Trump\u2019s executive orders. But when Congress passed funding for refugee admission this month for this fiscal year, refugee agencies said, the lawmakers budgeted for 75,000 people \u2014 similar to previous years.\n\nmelissa.etehad@latimes.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @melissaetehad\n\nann.simmons@latimes.com\n\nFor more on global development news, see our Global Development Watch page, and follow me @AMSimmons1 on Twitter", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "authors": "Melissa Etehad, Ann M.
