Robart, a Seattle federal judge, went too far in effectively shutting down implementation of Trump's ban nationwide.\n\n\"It is overbroad.... It shouldn\u2019t cover people who have never been to the United States,\u201d said August E. Flentje, the government attorney. He said any restraining order should only apply to foreigners from the 7 countries who currently live in the U.S. and were caught outside the country, or only to those living in Washington state.\n\nJudge Richard Clifton, an appointee of George W. Bush, appeared to agree. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it overbroad?\u201d he asked the state\u2019s lawyer.\n\nThe exchange left open the possibility that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges could issue a compromise decision that blocked part of Trump\u2019s order, but not all of it.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
