{"title": "What the Trump travel ban court case may ultimately hinge on", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/sd-trump-travel-ban-20170210-story.html", "text": "Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning the entrance of all refugees and travelers from seven majority Muslim nations, leading to chaos at U.S. airports and heartache around the world. At first, the order seemed even larger in scope; it was initially interpreted as affecting the lives of up to 500,000 green card holders from those nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 before the federal government cleared up confusion and said it still believed they were legal U.S. residents.\n\nNow, to the alarm of the president and his supporters and the relief of others, Trump has been swatted down. A week ago, a challenge to his order by the states of Washington and Minnesota led to a stay by Seattle-based U.S. District Judge James L. Robart. This week, three judges \u2014 Michelle T. Friedland, William C. Canby Jr. and Richard R. Clifton \u2014 from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Robart.\n\nContrary to the claims of U.S. government lawyers, the appellate panel ruled that many precedents showed it had the authority \u201cto adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action\u201d and to question claims that an executive action was done to protect the nation\u2019s security. The ruling noted the government offered no evidence that anyone from any of the seven nations had committed terrorist acts in the United States. It also noted that statements by Trump that he would seek or consider a ban on Muslim immigrants raised basic constitutional questions about the intent of the order.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? Trump on Friday declared he would announce next week what his next step would be. The Justice Department may seek an immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it\u2019s also possible that a majority of the active members of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would vote to have an en banc hearing in which a panel of 11 judges takes a second look at the federal trial court ruling.\n\nAP A Somali refugee family who had been stuck in limbo after President Donald Trump temporarily banned refugee entries gets a warm welcome at the Salt Lake City airport on Friday.

(AP)\n\nThe worst possible option, though, is one that is already under consideration by the White House, according to a Washington Post report: issuing a revised version of the travel ban. If such an order were a watered-down, face-saving maneuver, it would still have originated as a ban on Muslims. And if the order tries to respond to the weaknesses in the initial order by finessing the language, it seems likely it would be stayed by another federal judge \u2014 possibly after another day or two of chaos at airports \u2014 after being seen as an attempt by Trump to escape constitutional checks and balances.\n\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board believes the best likely course of action going forward is for Trump\u2019s Justice Department to accept a federal trial at which the claims and counterclaims about the extent of presidential authority could be examined in a less frantic atmosphere, starting with this section of federal law: \u201cWhenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nCritics and backers of Trump, and the president himself, shouldn\u2019t celebrate or criticize his court losses too much. Until a final decision is handed down, it seems certain that Judges Robart, Friedland, Canby and Clifton won\u2019t get the last word.\n\nTwitter: @sdutIdeas\n\nFacebook: UTOpinion", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
