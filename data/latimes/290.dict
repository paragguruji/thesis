Robart in Seattle is \u201cvastly over-broad,\u201d because it extends to many thousands of foreigners who have obtained U.S. visas but have never used them to travel here.\n\nInstead, Flentje urged the judges to focus on the \u201ccore concerns\u201d raised by those who challenged Trump\u2019s order, such as foreign students, doctors, technology company executives and tourists who were in the process of traveling to or from the United States and one of seven Muslim-majority nations targeted by Trump\u2019s order. When the ban was announced, many of these people were trapped outside the U.S. or detained upon arrival in the initial confusion over the rollout.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
