{"title": "Iraqis relieved to be left off Trump's new travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-iraq-immigration-order-20170306-story.html", "text": "Abu Hasan never understood why the U.S. travel ban issued by the Trump administration in January included Iraq, which has been a key ally in the battle against Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cThe order was wrong, wrong, wrong,\u201d said the militia commander fighting alongside the Iraqi military to oust the extremist group from the city of Mosul. \u201cWe are defending not just Iraq but the world against Islamic State.\u201d\n\nLike other Iraqis interviewed since President Trump signed a revised immigration order Monday, Abu Hasan said he was pleased that his country has been removed from the list.\n\nThe new order halts the issuing of new visas to people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government reviews its vetting procedures. Unlike the first order, which was blocked by court challenges, it does not apply to green-card holders or people who already have visas.\n\nThe White House was under pressure from both the State and Defense departments to remove Iraq from the list. Thousands of U.S. forces have been in Iraq since last fall, assisting the Iraqi-led coalition that has been battling Islamic State in Mosul since the fall.\n\nA fact sheet detailing the new order cited negotiations that resulted in Iraq agreeing to \u201cincrease cooperation with the U.S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe original travel ban upset many Iraqis. The parliament called for a reciprocal ban on Americans, but the prime minister rejected the idea.\n\nAhmed Galadi, 30, a soldier with the Interior Ministry\u2019s emergency response division in west Mosul, said the original ban was especially misguided when it came to Iraqis working with the Americans.\n\n\u201cWe are the guys who want to make Iraq better,\u201d he said.\n\nA father of two, he worked with U.S. forces for years and has paid a steep price. In 2009, his twin brother was killed while driving his car, shot in the head by a militia member who mistook him for Galadi. Scores of other Iraqis who worked with the U.S. were killed in his hometown of Diwaniya, south of Baghdad, he said.\n\n\u201cMy family doesn't know I'm working with Americans now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they did, they would say, \u2018Once the Americans go, where will you go? Because the militias will kill you.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe wants the option of fleeing to the U.S. if needed, especially for his wife, 12-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter. He was encouraged by the new order.\n\nImam Ahmed Rakan Ahmed, 30, also welcomed the removal of Iraq from the ban. But he was said it did nothing to address the most pressing problems in east Mosul, where he runs a mosque.\n\nHe and his family had fled the city after Islamic State took over but returned in December and reopened the mosque, after the militants were driven out of his neighborhood.\n\nMany of the families it serves are poor, but they have been gathering donations for those worse off as fighting has shifted to the city's west side.\n\n\u201cWhat's important for us is what's happening on the west side of Mosul, those displaced people who are suffering,\u201d the Muslim spiritual leader said as the call to prayer sounded.\n\nHe said the U.S. should have stayed long enough after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to prevent Islamic State from forming. \"America is responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's their duty to protect us.\u201d\n\nOthers were more enthusiastic about the revision to the order.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said Zryan Ibrahim, who lives in the northern city of Sulaymaniya and wants to attend a six-week exchange program in the U.S. and, later, graduate school there. She worried that the original ban would have quashed those plans.\n\nRachel Ramey, an 33-year-old American teacher living in Sulaymaniya with her Iraqi husband, said she was glad the ban was revised. Her husband had applied for a visa almost a year ago.\n\nThe couple married two years ago and planned to move to the U.S. and start a family.\n\nEven with Iraq off the list, Ramey remained nervous about the vetting process.\n\n\u201cWhat if we get to the airport and have everything together and they say, \u2018No, we're denying you\u2019?\u201d she said.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
