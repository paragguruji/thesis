The 24-year-old video game developer from South Africa had in November secured a ticket to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco \u2014 a cultural mecca for anyone who wants to make video games.\n\nA sponsor would cover the cost of his round-trip flight from Cape Town. Just two weeks ago, he received his visa to enter the U.S.\n\nThen President Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and travelers from seven countries.\n\nElgoni grew up in South Africa, but he was born in Sudan \u2014 one of the countries listed as part of the travel ban. As a dual citizen, he now doesn\u2019t know if he can attend GDC, which runs from Feb. 27 to March 3.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s sure of what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of conflicting accounts \u2014 some people say dual citizens are completely barred, some say it applies only to immigration and not visits \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I should risk it.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the president\u2019s immigration restrictions on Friday, but given the hasty implementation of the order and the ongoing back and forth between the White House and the courts (the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was hearing arguments from both sides on Tuesday), some international travelers remain wary of their chances of entering the country.\n\nLast year 27,000 people descended on San Francisco for the week-long video game conference. Of the attendees, 32% were not from the U.S. Shortly after Trump\u2019s immigration ban was announced, GDC offered full refunds to those who could no longer attend the conference because of the executive order. Last week, event organizers were still evaluating how many people were affected, and declined to provide a breakdown of attendees by geographic region.\n\nMany developers \u2014 even those already in the U.S. \u2014 lamented the effect the travel ban will have not only on this year\u2019s GDC, but on the local video game industry.\n\n\u201cGDC has been able to blossom because it takes place in a part of the world that\u2019s been open to and accepting of people of all races and identities,\u201d said Navid Khonsari, a green-card-holding game developer of Canadian and Iranian citizenship.\n\n\u201cWhen you start putting up these walls, it sends out a much bigger message, that we\u2019re not inclusive,\u201d said Khonsari, who has worked on video games such as \u201cResident Evil\u201d, \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d and, most recently, \u201c1979: Revolution.\u201d\n\nThe United States plays host to at least half a dozen global video game conferences, with some of the largest taking place in California: the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in Downtown Los Angeles; GDC in Downtown San Francisco. And while GDC has launched a European chapter, the flagship San Francisco conference remains the must-attend event for developers eager to rub shoulders with their peers.\n\n\u201cThe biggest value was in meeting other game developers and showing them my work,\u201d said Mahdi Bahrami, an Iranian game designer who attended GDC for the last three years but decided against attending this year after Trump won the election.\n\nFor game developers, who primarily interact via social networks such as Twitter, GDC represents an opportunity to build both professional relationships and intercontinental friendships. In Bahrami\u2019s case, attending GDC helped him get funding for \u201cEngare,\u201d a game inspired by the culture of Iran. But it was also an opportunity to break down cultural barriers, particularly in an industry that is predominantly white and male. \u201cI learned something, and they learned something,\u201d he said.\n\nFresh out of college, Elgoni also sees GDC as an opportunity to kick-start his game development career. But unless the travel ban is formally dropped, he doubts he\u2019ll attend.\n\n\u201cI feel that it would be better for me to not go,\u201d Elgoni said. \u201cBut deep inside, I really want to go.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
