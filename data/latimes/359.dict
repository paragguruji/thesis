{"title": "For Los Angeles Jews, Trump is a rallying cry the community hasn't seen in decades", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-jewish-coalition-20170310-story.html", "text": "The rise of President Trump has sparked a new streak of activism in Los Angeles\u2019 Jewish community that many veteran leaders say they haven\u2019t seen in decades.\n\nJewish leaders in the religious, political and cultural worlds have formed a coalition aimed at denouncing what they perceive to be threats to religious tolerance, democratic values, equal rights and a free press.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric and actions toward Muslim immigrants were the impetus for the coalition, known as Jews United for Democracy and Justice, said Rabbi Ken Chasen.\n\n\u201cThere a uniqueness to this moment,\u201d said Chasen, senior rabbi at Leo Baeck Temple in Bel-Air. \u201cJews understand that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us. People who are at risk \u2014 particularly immigrants \u2014 that is a clarion call to Jews. Our concerns about the treatment of immigrants are not partisan or political, they\u2019re Jewish. The single most frequently repeated command in the Torah is to care for the stranger, because Jews know what it\u2019s like to be the stranger.\u201d\n\nNot since the 1960s, when Jewish leaders embraced the civil rights movement and denounced the Vietnam War, has there been such a galvanizing issue as this one, Chasen said.\n\nJews United for Democracy and Justice has garnered the support of more than 2,000 Jewish people \u2014 including prominent rabbis and elected leaders such as L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Atty. Mike Feuer \u2014 who signed the group\u2019s organizing statement.\n\nJewish groups across the country have interpreted Trump\u2019s travel bans targeting migrants from Muslim-majority countries as a call to action. For many people, the policies have evoked painful memories of the countries that turned Jews away when they tried to flee Nazi persecution.\n\nSome in the Jewish community fear America\u2019s reputation as a welcoming place for refugees is being irreparably damaged as Trump has ordered a temporary ban on refugees from around the world.\n\nThe Iran-Iraq War forced Sam Yebri\u2019s family to flee Iran and into exile in the United States when he was a child in the early 1980s.\n\nYebri, now a lawyer and president of 30 Years After, an Iranian Jewish nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, said he understands that Americans are concerned over the Syrian refugee crisis. people seeking asylum in the U.S. should be vetted, but that doesn\u2019t warrant Trump\u2019s hard-line policies, he said.\n\n\u201cIt betrays our history and values as a country to shut our doors when there are innocent people who are being persecuted,\u201d Yebri said. \u201cI hope the administration will strive to find the right middle ground as opposed to closing our doors and closing our hearts to folks like my family just a generation ago.\u201d\n\nThe Jewish coalition gathered signatures recently from more than 110 clergy members, L.A. County\u2019s entire Jewish state legislative delegation, seven current and former members of Congress, and 60 current and former elected and appointed officials, according to the coalition.\n\nThe group is focused on three guiding principles: The U.S. is a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants and \u201caspires to equality, respect and justice for all people.\u201d\n\nZev Yaroslavsky, a former L.A. County supervisor and a member of the group\u2019s organizing committee, said he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for the coalition. He said the group will stand by refugees fleeing oppression as well as immigrants in the United States who \u201ctonight as they go to sleep fear a knock on the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something the Jewish community wants to speak out on,\u201d Yaroslavsky said. \u201cIt speaks to a thirst in our community to stand up and not be silent. We know what the costs are of remaining silent.\u201d\n\nThe vandalism of Jewish cemeteries and recent bomb threats to Jewish centers in L.A. and other cities have heightened anxieties in the faith community, said David Myers, professor of Jewish history and former chairman of the UCLA history department.\n\nHe said he fears the election of Trump has ushered in a wave of xenophobic populism not seen in decades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had that ilk before as candidates and prominent politicians, but not as president,\u201d said Myers, a member of the coalition\u2019s organizing committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that\u2019s his rhetoric; a good number of the first actions taken seem to operationalize some of this exclusionary ethos of Trump\u2019s populism.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s opening condemnation of anti-Semitic threats and hate crimes during his first address to a joint session of Congress in late February was welcomed, but long overdue, Rabbi Chasen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appreciated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality, though, is that there is a mounting spate of threats to Jewish institutions all across the United States. The president needs to go beyond simply denouncing and demonstrate the desire to take action steps and send an absolute clarity of message to those who are doing this: \u2018Not in our America.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
