Robart in Seattle. The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, blocked the government from enforcing President Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order . The ruling came in response to a challenge from the states of Washington and Minnesota.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued the states lack standing to challenge the travel ban because they cannot show the executive order has directly harmed them.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Maura Dolan and David Lauter", "type": "article"}
