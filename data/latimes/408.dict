Earlier this week, Iran said it would take retaliatory action. Ghasemi said the policy of the new U.S. administration left Iran no other choice but to ban the wrestlers.\n\nThe competition in the western Iranian city of Kermanshah is scheduled for Feb. 16-17.\n\nUSA Wrestling had said it would send a team to participate in the Freestyle World Cup, one of the most prestigious competitions in all of international wrestling.\n\nWrestling is extremely popular in Iran, and U.S. freestyle wrestlers have competed there since the 1998 Takhti Cup in Tehran following an absence of nearly 20 years. Since then, Americans have attended Iran-hosted wrestling competitions 15 times. Iranians, in return, made 16 visits to the U.S. as guest of USA Wrestling since the 1990s.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
