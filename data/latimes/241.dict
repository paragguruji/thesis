Robart's temporary restraining order Friday that suspended enforcement of the most controversial provisions of the ban across the country.\n\n\"The injunction immediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment,\" lawyers wrote in their motion.\n\n\"The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation\u2019s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the President\u2019s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk,\" it said.\n\nThe motion follows an earlier filing by the government giving notice of its intention to appeal the Seattle judge's order.\n\nIn a brief on behalf of the administration, acting Solicitor Gen. Noel Francisco said Robart's order, issued in response to a suit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, was an \"impermissible intrusion\" into Trump's authority and amounted to \"second-guessing\" the president.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a suspension of travel to the U.S. by citizens of countries with connections to terrorism is needed until the government can develop a system of \"extreme vetting\" to screen incoming visitors.\n\nIt imposes a temporary ban on new arrivals from seven predominantly Muslim countries--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Iran and Somalia--and suspends resettlement of refugees in the U.S.\n\nMany travelers from those countries began arriving at airports Saturday after Robart issued the restraining order that set aside the ban pending further legal arguments. Other courts had previously issued similar rulings, but Robart's was effective nationwide.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
