That step could effectively void his first executive order and end the court proceedings over it.\n\nTrump insisted that he was confident his policy was on solid legal ground, a day after judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to reinstate his temporary bans on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries and on all refugees. But he suggested that he was uninterested in a prolonged fight in court.\n\n\"We will win that battle,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe unfortunate part is that it takes time.\u201d\n\nThe administration was considering several options, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said late Friday at the White House, including asking the Supreme Court to lift the temporary restraining order on the travel bans that the 9th Circuit panel kept in place.\n\nThe new order under consideration would suspend only refugee admissions and the issuance of new visas, according to an administration official familiar with the internal deliberations. Everyone who already was granted a visa or refugee status would be allowed to keep them.\n\nThe new directive would be intended to allay the type of chaos that erupted as a result of Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 order, which blocked an estimated 60,000 people with valid visas, some while they were in midair and others who were removed from planes bound for the U.S. before takeoff. The federal court rulings against Trump cited the rough implementation of the order in staying it.\n\nIn addition to temporary bans on entry by refugees and on all citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the order Trump issued also indefinitely suspended the admission of Syrian refugees and gave preference to refugees who are members of persecuted religious minorities.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country,\u201d Trump said earlier Friday at a White House news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nIf Trump does decide to fight the restraining order all the way to the Supreme Court, he may undercut his objectives, legal experts warn, particularly given the court\u2019s 4-4 split between Republican and Democratic appointees.\n\nA tie is possible, similar to the stalemate last year over President Obama\u2019s immigration order temporarily protecting millions in the country illegally from deportation. If the Trump administration can\u2019t win five votes, the 9th Circuit order would remain in effect.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to take its medicine and withdraw the current executive order, substituting with one that clearly exempts [green card holders] and previously admitted nonimmigrant visa holders like students and medical residents. Otherwise, the government is in a box,\u201d said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law at Roger Williams Law School in Rhode Island.\n\nIf the government appeals to the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy would receive the request and probably ask for written briefs in the coming days.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative justices would be likely to see merit in the government\u2019s claim that the law calls for deferring to the president on matters of immigration and national security.\n\nThe liberal justices would be likely to agree with the two states that sued the administration, Washington and Minnesota, that Trump\u2019s order was rash, disruptive and unfair to foreign travelers who were traveling legally into and out of the country.\n\nIf the White House chooses to fight on, justices could take action that would effectively yield the same outcome as Trump rescinding the order, with a a middle-ground ruling rather than an all-or-nothing decision.\n\nThe court could allow the ban to apply to thousands of foreigners who have obtained U.S. visas but have not yet used them, but not to green card holders, foreign students, doctors, technology company executives and tourists who were already living in the U.S. when the travel restrictions were announced.\n\nSuch a move could allow the high court to avoid a tie and a broader debate on the constitutionality of the ban.\n\nSome immigration lawyers say a middle-ground ruling makes sense legally and practically.\n\n\u201cThis would provide a balanced remedy that would relieve the chaos,\u201d Margulies said. \u201cIt would protect the visa holders who are here and want to travel outside the country. It\u2019s unfair to change the rules on them. But it would not apply to people who have never been admitted to this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible Justices [Stephen G.] Breyer or [Elena] Kagan might think a modified restraining order makes more sense,\u201d he said.\n\nTemple University law professor Peter Spiro agreed that if the case reached the high court, the justices might move toward narrowing the order, noting that U.S. law gives more protection to people who are in this country, even if they were foreign citizens.\n\n\u201cThe courts have been generally deferential to the political branches when it comes to immigration, but they have been less deferential when it comes to noncitizens already present in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this makes sense, both politically and legally\u2026.\n\n\u201cFrom the administration\u2019s perspective, a limited reinstatement would get them much of what it\u2019s looking for: No new visas would be issued to nationals of the listed countries or to refugees.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorney August Flentje advocated for such an approach in the final minutes of his argument Tuesday before the appeals court panel. He called the temporary restraining order against the ban \u201cvastly over-broad.\u201d\n\nBut in its decision Thursday night, the three judges said courts were ill-equipped to make such distinctions.\n\n\u201cEven if the [temporary restraining order] might be over-broad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the executive order,\u2019\u2019 the panel ruled.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Michael A.
