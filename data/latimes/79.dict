The court will be examining a Hawaii judge\u2019s ruling that blocked the executive order on the grounds that by targeting countries that are predominantly Muslim it discriminated on the basis of religion.\n\nThe order \u2014 which would stop all refugee resettlement for 120 days and block citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days \u2014 is a revised version of Trump\u2019s original travel ban.\n\nIn February, the 9th Circuit upheld a nationwide injunction on the original order, ruling that it violated due process rights because it was enacted without notice and without giving people the right to challenge it.\n\nThe revised order removed restrictions on holders of visas and green cards but still targeted predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nAnother ruling blocking part of the revised ban is pending in the Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing on that appeal is also set for May.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-03", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
