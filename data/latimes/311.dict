Four of those are Iranian, and all hold green cards or U.S. visas, she said.\n\nA woman of Iranian descent who was among the seven was deported by federal officials late Saturday, Pasquarella said. The woman, who has lived in Austria for most of her life, was forced to withdraw her student visa and was deported to Copenhagen, according to Pasquarella. Earlier Saturday, an immigration attorney said a 70-year-old Iranian man was put on a plane out of the country after landing at LAX.\n\nRelatives of those being detained stood nervously throughout the terminal, desperate for any shred of information about the fate of their loved ones. Bayar Yousif had been trading text messages with his brother, Bessar, who had been detained since he landed at 4:30 pm.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know if they will release him or if they will deport him,\u201d Yousif said.\n\nThe brothers immigrated to the U.S. with their parents in 2014 \u2014 five years after seeking refugee status \u2014 and settled in Fallbrook. All four of them have green cards, but Bessar had traveled to Kurdistan last week, where he got engaged.\n\nJust after 8 pm, Bayar's phone rang. It was his brother, though he didn't have an update on his status.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Bayar said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAround 10 p.m., 28-year-old Neda Daemi was released after a detention that lasted ten hours. The student, who holds a green card and had traveled to Iran five months ago, said she was held with approximately 40 other people, but praised federal authorities for treating them well.\n\nStill, she was shocked to find immigration officials waiting for her when she landed at LAX.\n\n\u201cWhen I got here and they told me you can\u2019t go in I was like \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAsked what she would say to President Trump, Daemi said she would implore him to \"Just think of your own children. would you do the same to your children? Muslims are good people.\"\n\nIt remained unclear exactly how many people had been detained. In addition to the seven detainees the ACLU said it was representing, the legal director of an Los Angeles-based immigrants rights group also told The Times as many as 50 Iranians had been detained on one flight. Representatives of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency did not respond to requests for comment or provide a full tally of those being detained at California airports on Saturday.\n\nPasquarella said Trump\u2019s rush to enact the executive order has exposed countless people to potentially illegal detentions.\n\n\u201cI would say it has been done without regard to the legality of it. Green-card holders are not only being detained, but they\u2019re being turned around and deported to the country that they came form. It is unlawful,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly the discriminatory nature of the executive order we think is unlawful.\u201d\n\nAn Iranian woman whose citizenship swearing-in ceremony will take place in two weeks was among those detained at LAX on Saturday, according to Jordan Cummings, an immigration attorney. The woman has held a green card for five years, Cummings said.\n\nProtesters rally at LAX\n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay of Trump\u2019s order late Saturday night, halting the deportations of any refugees or others who hold valid visas to enter the U.S. It was unclear how that would affect those being held at LAX, or if they would remain in detention while their cases were being considered.\n\nHundreds of people rallied at Tom Bradley International Terminal to protest the detentions, their chants echoing through the building as they waved candles and held signs denouncing Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cNo hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here,\u201d they chanted.\n\nBeverly Weise, 66, said she felt a moral obligation to protest on Saturday after she spent two weeks volunteering at Souda refugee camp in Greece, where 3,000 people from Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia were housed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re running away from war, persecution \u2014 they can\u2019t understand why we are so hostile,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they want is a peaceful life.\u201d\n\nOff-duty airport employee Molly O\u2019Leary, 56, said she sees hundreds of immigrants pass through LAX every day.\n\n\u201cI understand being careful,\u201d she said, holding a candle. \u201cI don\u2019t understand outright banning people, innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe protesters at LAX erupted in cheers when news broke of the federal court decision staying Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cI think it's wonderful,\u201d Mohi Khairandish, a 52-year-old who immigrated to the U.S. from Iran in 1976 and still has relatives there, said of the stay. \u201cI'm hoping that the ban is proven unconstitutional in general, if necessary, at the Supreme Court because I think it's a very un-American ban.\u201d\n\nWhile the New York court decision may have marked a victory for opponents of the ban, the emergency stay came too late for some. Kristen Jackson, an attorney with Public Counsel, said attorneys tried to intervene after a 70-year-old Iranian man was held by federal authorities at LAX. His son is an American resident and the father was moving to the U.S., she said.\n\nJackson and other attorneys filed court papers to try to stop the man\u2019s removal, but he was put on an airplane back to Iran, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's been shocking and totally saddening to see this happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also heartening to see how quickly people are banding together.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "James Queally, Alene Tchekmedyian, Dakota Smith", "type": "article"}
