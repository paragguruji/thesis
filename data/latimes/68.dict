They used the president's campaign statements promising to suspend Muslim travel to the U.S. as evidence of the order's anti-Muslim bias.\n\nGovernment lawyers have argued that the president is not singling out Muslims but instead acting within his power to restrict immigration and safeguard national security while better vetting procedures are developed to prevent potential terrorists from entering the U.S.\n\nTrump has said he'll take the case over the travel ban to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
