Robart issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the order last week after concluding that a challenge by the states of Washington and Minnesota was likely to succeed.\n\nRobart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, also concluded that halting the ban \u2014 at least for a while \u2014 would cause no undue harm to the country.\n\nTrump administration lawyers have argued that the country could be at risk of a terrorist attack until heightened vetting measures for travelers from those countries are put into place.\n\nThe administration can appeal the decision directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has four Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees and may be unable to reach a majority decision. The seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia remains vacant.\n\nUC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky said it was difficult to predict whether the Supreme Court would review the decision.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want a 4-4 split, but they really like having the last word on high-profile case,\u201d the constitutional law expert said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Maura Dolan and Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
