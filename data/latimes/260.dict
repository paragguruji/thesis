Five years later the United Kingdom finally gave them political asylum. When refugees were halted this weekend from entering the United States as a result of President Trump\u2019s executive order, Deng empathized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never really asked to leave my homeland, and a lot of these people go through a lot of things that they have no control of,\u201d Deng said. \u201cTo really to see a light at the end of the tunnel and to go towards that light and then that light is turned off is very difficult, not just individually, for the family.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was a kid as a refugee in Egypt every day there was always a hope that we get to leave tomorrow or get to go somewhere. Never knew where, we just wanted somewhere where we wanted an opportunity to make something out of it, and that opportunity came five years later. Now I\u2019m thankful for growing up in Egypt and I\u2019ve learned a lot. But at the same time, I know what it feels like to wait for that opportunity to come every day.\u201d\n\nDeng and his eight brothers and sisters fled Sudan when he was just 4 years old. Their father, a Sudanese government official, was reportedly jailed after a coup in the country that has experienced civil war for decades. In 1994 Aldo Deng was granted political asylum in the United Kingdom, and took his family with him. Deng became a naturalized British citizen in 2006 and has dual citizenship with the U.K. and South Sudan.\n\nOn Monday Deng released a statement calling himself a \u201c#proudrefugee.\u201d He expressed support for refugees worldwide regardless of their religion, and support of policies that welcome them.\n\nAfter Tuesday's game, Deng spoke for the first time since Trump signed the executive order. He doesn\u2019t like to get involved in politics, but was willing to share his perspective if it could help other refugees.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement this week that 800 refugees were set to resettle in the United States this week. The executive order, signed Friday, includes language that suspends the United States\u2019 refugee program for 120 days, and suspends Syrian refugees indefinitely. According to reports, the department of homeland security said Tuesday that 872 refugees would be granted waivers to enter the country.\n\nThe order also initially banned travel from citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. A later clarification said the ban did not apply to people who have green cards as legal permanent residents.\n\nDeng and his family are not subject to the travel ban as they are from South Sudan, an independent country. Further, the department of homeland security said this week that people holding U.K. passports could enter, even if they had dual citizenship with a banned country. But Deng has friends from Sudan who were impacted.\n\nThe executive order\u2019s stated purpose was to protect American citizens from terrorism. Deng was asked about fears worldwide that allowing refugees into a country will foster terrorism.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to look into that, you\u2019ve got to go into facts and what is true and what is not,\u201d Deng said. \u201cI mean, from what I understand, I haven\u2019t seen a lot of refugees committing terrorist acts in this country.\u201d\n\nSince it took Deng\u2019s family five years to gain asylum, he noted that was time for his family to be screened.\n\n\u201cI understand [a refugee\u2019s experience] because I went through it,\u201d Deng said. \u201cPeople that are around me know it, because we speak about it and we do talk about it. The same time, I do understand when you\u2019re told something that\u2019s not true and you\u2019re told to believe other things, I understand the fear and your reaction coming out of it. If somebody told me a story and that\u2019s all I know, I\u2019d probably act to what I\u2019m hearing. \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the solution is to it, but a lot of people that do support this [travel ban] are supporting it because of what they hear and what they believe also.\u201d\n\nLakers tonight\n\nAT WASHINGTON\n\nWhen: 4 PST.\n\nWhere: Verizon Center.\n\nOn the air: TV: Spectrum SportsNet, Spectrum Deportes; Radio: 710, 1330.\n\nRecords: Lakers 17-34; Wizards 28-20.\n\nRecord vs. Wizards (2015-16): 1-1.\n\nUpdate: Wizards Coach Scott Brooks was named Eastern Conference coach of the month for January.
