The proclamation bars only certain people from certain countries, not everyone from a given country. The proclamation includes North Korea and Venezuela, two non-Muslim-majority countries. And the new travel ban does not bar refugees from entering the United States,\u201d Yale-Loehr said.\n\nThe White House order, which cites national security concerns and a global review of vetting procedures for entry to the U.S., calls for an indefinite ban on almost all travel to the U.S. by nationals of seven countries, which include most that were targeted in Trump\u2019s initial ban, issued after he took office.\n\nEffective Oct. 18, the new measure bans entry by most citizens of Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. It also imposes restrictions on a small number of citizens in Venezuela and additional screenings for Iraqis. The ban allows for some exceptions, such as for Iranians who are students or participants in cultural exchange programs.\n\nSudan, whose nationals were previously blocked from coming to the U.S. under a prior temporary ban that expired Sunday, has been dropped off the list. Chad, Venezuela and North Korea are new entries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an uphill battle against this one,\u201d said Peter Spiro, a constitutional and international law professor at Temple University. \u201cThis travel ban is detailed, more professional and a much tougher target for anyone to challenge.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court canceled arguments over the prior travel ban that were scheduled for Oct. 10. Justices were supposed to hear lawyers for the Trump administration and immigrant rights groups make their cases on the ban, which district judges in Hawaii and Maryland and appeals courts in Virginia and California had deemed unconstitutional.\n\nBut with major portions of that travel ban expired and replaced by the new one, the court ordered lawyers to submit letters on what should happen next. The court could decide the case is moot. That would leave challengers who had fought since Trump\u2019s initial ban in January to get a final decision on the president\u2019s immigration authority from the highest court to start over again in district court lawsuits.\n\nThe new ban does not address a refugee ban that is still in place through late October or the soon-to-expire fiscal year cap on refugee admissions. The White House has said it will announce a new cap on refugee admissions in the coming days.\n\nActivists derided Trump\u2019s previous bans, and federal judges said they were unconstitutional for discriminating nearly exclusively against Muslims.\n\nExperts said the addition of nations without Muslim majorities \u2014 North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 and Chad, which has a slight Muslim majority, hurt the argument that the ban is directed only at Muslims. The addition of North Korea is somewhat of a formality as, in practice, almost no North Koreans are currently allowed in the U.S. The ban on Venezuelans is limited to a small sliver of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nThe president\u2019s first travel ban, issued Jan. 27, spurred tens of thousands of visa cancellations, chaos at U.S. international airports and dozens of lawsuits before it was blocked in court.\n\nIraq was included in that ban, and exceptions such as those for green card holders and people with valid visas were added when the president signed a revised ban in March that removed Iraq and had a more orderly implementation. Judges also blocked that ban before the Supreme Court let part of it move forward with some exceptions, and an appeals court ordered the government to allow travelers with close relatives in the U.S. to be exempt.\n\nBut immigrants in the U.S. have routinely complained to advocacy groups and State Department officials that the travel ban and the president\u2019s hard-line stance on immigration have nonetheless made coming to the U.S. a harder and slower process.\n\nFears of additional travel troubles resurfaced Monday in Los Angeles, home to the nation\u2019s largest Iranian American community. At Amiri Tour and Travel, an agency that caters mostly to Iranians, owner Mike Amiri said calls about bookings had mostly stopped since Trump announced the new travel rules.\n\n\u201cI'm worried this new travel ban is going to make business even worse now. This phone was ringing up \u2019til 11 p.m. and we were getting them plane tickets to the United States and Iran but now it's not ringing,\u201d Amiri said. \u201cWe've been trying to figure out if they can get visas so we can arrange travel for them to the United States, but it's just not happening.\u201d\n\nMohammed Janfar, a 39-year-old Iranian American insurance agent, feared the new ban could thwart his fiancee\u2019s travel plans, which had been on-and-off since January. His fiancee, who is Iranian, is in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates going through the final stages of approval for a visa to move to Los Angeles. Janfar said he\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t receive a visa before the new ban takes effect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep wasting her time. At this point I don\u2019t know what else to do. Everything is in turmoil. We went through this in June and now here we are again,\u201d said Janfar, a veteran of the U.S. Navy. \u201cThis is just a really bad roller-coaster ride. I served this country, so why can\u2019t I bring someone into this country that I want to marry? She has been thoroughly vetted. I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe National Iranian American Council decried the ban and said the administration \u201chas now taken steps to make its Muslim ban \u2026 permanent.\u201d The new measure, it said in a statement, was \u201cnothing but an extension of the same discriminatory policy first rolled out in January.\u201d\n\nBecca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is still a Muslim ban \u2014 they simply added three additional countries,\u201d said Heller, whose group is among those challenging the Trump administration in the Supreme Court.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem, Melissa Etehad", "type": "article"}
