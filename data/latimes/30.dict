The groups say the latest version of the ban, the administration's third, also violates federal law and the Constitution.\n\nTrump announced the latest restrictions last weekend after the previous ban expired. The restrictions are targeted at countries that the Department of Homeland Security says fail to share sufficient information with the U.S. or haven't taken necessary security precautions. The new restrictions impact citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 and some Venezuelan government officials and their families \u2014 and are to go into effect Oct. 18. The prior ban also included Sudan but didn't include Chad, North Korea or Venezuela.\n\nIn their two-page letter, the ACLU and others say they want to amend their existing lawsuit to cover the president's latest proclamation and seek a preliminary injunction \"or other relief\" suspending the visa and entry restrictions in the proclamation.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email after the ACLU announced its intention to take legal action that the department \"will continue to vigorously defend the President's inherent authority to keep this country safe.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
