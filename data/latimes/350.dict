{"title": "California to Trump: Keep ICE out of our courthouses", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-chief-justice-trump-20170316-story.html", "text": "California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye asked the Trump administration on Thursday to stop immigration agents from \u201cstalking\u201d California\u2019s courthouses to make arrests.\n\n\u201cCourthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly.\n\nHer letter did not say which courthouses had been the location of such \u201cstalking,\u201d but judges and lawyers in Southern California have complained of seeing immigration agents posted near courts.\n\nShe said she feared the practice would erode public trust in the state courts.\n\n\u201cEnforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair,\u201d wrote Cantil-Sakauye, who was appointed by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and is considered one of the more conservative justices on the state\u2019s high court.\n\n\u201cThey not only compromise our core value of fairness but they undermine the judiciary\u2019s ability to provide equal access to justice.\n\n\u201cI respectfully request that you refrain from this sort of enforcement in California's courthouses.\u201d\n\nThe chief justice\u2019s letter, prompted by complaints from trial judges, follows a report in The Times about teams of immigration agents \u2014 some in uniform, some not \u2014 sweeping into courtrooms or lurking outside court complexes in California, Arizona, Texas and Colorado in recent weeks.\n\nImmigration officials say they make arrests in courthouses only when all other options have been exhausted.\n\nIn her letter, Cantil-Sakauye called the courts \u201cthe main point of contact for millions of the most vulnerable Californians in times of anxiety, stress, and crises in their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrime victims, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, witnesses to crimes who are aiding law enforcement, limited-English speakers, unrepresented litigants, and children and families all come to our courts seeking justice and due process of law,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJudges \u201cstrive to mitigate fear\u201d and assure litigants and others that they will be treated fairly.\n\nCantil-Sakauye also stressed that the three branches of government have distinct obligations, and separation of powers rules ensure \u201cthe harmonious existence of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
