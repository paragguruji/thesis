Plan B, he said, was to fly her to stay with relatives in Canada, Europe or Armenia.\n\nBut her arrival Monday was seamless.\n\nLess than an hour after his fiancee landed, Meneshian spotted her carting her luggage out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal.\n\n\u201cNothing happened to me,\u201d she said, laughing and smiling. She identified herself only as Ana. \u201cI have school, I have a job. I have to go back to my life.\u201d\n\nAmid the confusion and apprehension following Trump\u2019s recent executive order temporarily blocking travelers entering the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, there were stories like that of Ana.\n\nThe executive order, which Trump said is needed to protect the country from terrorist attacks, blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for at least 90 days. It also imposes a ban for 120 days on refugees from any country entering the U.S. and bars refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nCritics said the ban unfairly targets Muslims and imposes undue hardship on innocent families.\n\nMeneshian\u2019s mother, who was also at the airport, spent her weekend much less worried. In fact, she said she had zero concerns about her future daughter-in-law\u2019s travel plans and supports Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cOur borders have to be secure,\u201d said Zara Meneshian, who immigrated to the U.S. from Soviet Armenia in the late \u201970s. \u201cI waited 30 years to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHer only qualm was the chaos and confusion that erupted when the order was put in place immediately.\n\nAs she was leaving the airport, she told a protester \u2014 holding a sign that read, \u201cI stand with all immigrants\u201d \u2014 to go home.\n\n\u201cYou have your priorities wrong,\u201d she told him.\n\nThere were a dozen or more protesters outside the arrivals area with an air horn late Wednesday, and attorneys said the last traveler they spoke to, from Iran, estimated that 50 people from different countries were still being detained.\n\nTuesday, a family of six from Afghanistan \u2014 a country not included in Trump\u2019s order \u2014 was detained for more than seven hours with no food, according to Kristy White, a volunteer immigration attorney.\n\nShe said the father, a mechanic, and his family were granted special immigrant visas for his work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan.\n\nBut when he landed, White said, customs officers accused him of having fake passports and threatened to deport him and his family. It\u2019s unclear if Trump\u2019s executive order was cited.\n\nHe said the officers told him he would never get into this country, White said.\n\nThe man was taken to one room, White said, while his wife and four young children, all under 10 years old, were placed in another.\n\nOfficers allegedly tried to compel the man, who is illiterate, to sign paperwork renouncing his visa, but he refused, White said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to get this visa for three years \u2014 they\u2019re not going to take it away,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nOfficers told him they would \u201ccall Kabul\u201d to find out if the passports were authentic, and if no one answered, he and his family would be deported, White said.\n\nWhat transpired afterward is unclear, but around 8:30 p.m., the family was released.\n\n\u201cThey all grabbed water from us as soon as they came out and started drinking it,\u201d White said.\n\nShe added that during the detention, she tried to file paperwork with Customs and Border Protection officials indicating that she was the family\u2019s attorney. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s getting access to counsel back there.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a relief organization was helping the family resettle.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
