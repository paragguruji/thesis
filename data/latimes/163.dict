This week, they\u2019re going to court.\n\nMore than 100 technology companies \u2014 including industry big guns Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, and newcomers such as Snap, Lyft and Scopely \u2014 joined forces Sunday to file a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing against President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nThe joint brief, filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a Washington judge\u2019s move to halt enforcement of the executive order, contends the ban is unconstitutional, unfair and, above all else, bad for business.\n\n\u201cThe order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world\u2019s best employees,\u201d the companies said in the filing. \u201cIt disrupts ongoing business operations, and it threatens companies\u2019 ability to attract talent, business, and investment in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe filing comes after a week of activism from tech firms, whose industry emerged as the first and loudest corporate opponent of Trump\u2019s executive order. It marks a noticeable departure from the sector\u2019s long-held desire to appear apolitical for fear of alienating customers.\n\n\u201cFor years, the tech industry tried to stay outside of politics,\u201d said Eden Gillott Bowe, president of crisis and reputation management firm Gillott Communications.\n\nMany tech chief executives stayed quiet in the days after Trump\u2019s election victory. Leaders in the industry gathered at Trump Tower in December for a meeting with the then-president-elect, but no one confronted him about his campaign rhetoric, including a hard-line stance on immigration. Even those known for being outspoken on issues such as sexism and discrimination \u2014 such as Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg \u2014 were reticent on the new president and his policy proposals.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s gotten to the point where they no longer can\u201d remain silent, Gillott Bowe said.\n\nPart of it is optics, according to public relations experts, who cited mounting pressure internally from employees and externally from customers as a reason for firms jumping on the bandwagon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to saying, \u2018No comment,\u2019\u201d Gillott Bowe said. \u201cWhen someone makes a crazy allegation and you say, \u2018No comment,\u2019 you look guilty. When bad things are happening and you don\u2019t speak up, it looks like you\u2019re silently agreeing.\u201d\n\nIn this highly politicized era, public relations are especially important, as ride-hailing company Uber learned the hard way last week when a poorly timed tweet during a taxi strike over the immigration ban led to a customer revolt in which some 200,000 people deleted the Uber app from their phones. Uber \u2014 whose chief executive, Travis Kalanick, served on a panel advising Trump about economic issues before stepping down last week \u2014 was among the companies that signed the brief.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla were added Monday. Elon Musk, who is CEO of both companies and also serves on Trump\u2019s business panel, had been less critical of the order than many in the industry. \"As soon as we saw the brief this morning, we insisted on being added,\u201d a Tesla spokeswoman said.\n\nAmazon.com, which has not signed the brief, plans to file its own declaration of support for a lawsuit filed by Washington state\u2019s attorney general against Trump and his administration regarding the ban.\n\nOther high-profile companies that haven\u2019t signed the brief include IBM and Oracle, both of which have executives on Trump\u2019s panel, and Palantir Technologies, whose co-founder, Peter Thiel, served as an advisor on Trump\u2019s transition team and remains a supporter of the president.\n\nOptics aside, business experts see the friend-of-the-court filing as a way for tech companies to stand up for their own business interests. After all, if the immigration ban were to expand, it could hit businesses where it really hurts: their bottom line.\n\n\u201cThe order has had immediate, adverse effects on the employees of American businesses,\u201d the companies said in the filing. \u201cSeveral major companies reported substantial disruptions from the order because their employees were ensnared in the order\u2019s travel restrictions.\u201d\n\nIn an internal memo to employees, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said that about 100 employees were directly affected by the ban. At Microsoft, 76 employees were identified as being citizens of the countries listed as part of the travel ban.\n\n\u201cIf the order stands, it is impossible for individuals and businesses to anticipate which countries may be affected next,\u201d the brief states.\n\nThe companies warned that the instability and uncertainty the travel ban has created may incentivize immigration and foreign investment to countries other than the U.S. They also warned that multinational companies may decide to move their operations abroad, which would probably have adverse effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe technology industry relies heavily on foreign talent, particularly in light of the domestic talent shortage in fields such as science, engineering and mathematics. For all the industry\u2019s talk about doing things differently, immigration and staffing difficulties are among the great unifiers.\n\nAlthough the industry has rallied in the past in support of immigration reform that would make it easier for U.S. firms to hire talent from abroad \u2014 most notably with the creation of FWD.US, an immigration lobbying group founded by executives such as Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer, and former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates \u2014 legal experts were struck by how quickly the industry galvanized around the friend-of-the-court brief.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Tracey Lien, James F.
