Later, the word \"outrageous\" was removed in a revised statement that was sent out.\n\n\"The President\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"As the law states, 'Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,' \" the statement said.\n\nLawsuits have argued that the executive order's focus on countries that are predominantly Muslim and its provision for giving preference to religious minorities could violate the Constitution's protections against religious discrimination. Civil rights groups have also challenged the president's targeting of specific nationalities.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
