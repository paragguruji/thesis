{"title": "Court ruling on travel ban welcomed, questioned", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/sd-me-ninth-circuit-20170209-story.html", "text": "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a block on President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on travel from seven Muslim majority countries was greeted with celebration by some and confusion by others.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s opponents cheered when asked about the decision, while his supporters said they didn\u2019t understand how the court could block Trump\u2019s action.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration appealed to the court after a Seattle judge approved a restraining order in one of the many cases that sprung up across the nation after the travel ban was signed at the end of Trump\u2019s first week as president. The 9th Circuit unanimously agreed with the Seattle judge\u2019s decision.\n\nPeter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney in southern California and vocal Trump supporter, said he hadn\u2019t yet had chance to read the 29-page ruling, but that he was surprised.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what was the basis of how they got around the law, but the law seems pretty clear to me that the President had absolute authority to do what he did,\u201d Nunez said by telephone. \u201cThe only thing I can say is the 9th Circuit has a well-earned reputation of being a left-wing, maverick court.\u201d\n\nDavid Schlesinger, a San Diego attorney who works on appellate cases in the 9th Circuit, said he was not surprised by the decision given the way the conversation went during the oral arguments in the case. He was surprised, he said, that it was completely unanimous given one Republican-appointed judge\u2019s seemingly skeptical questions during the debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always easier to sell the merits of a decision to the public when there are judges appointed by presidents of different political parties on the panel,\u201d Schlesinger said. \u201cThat was true here.\u201d\n\nHanif Mohebi, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in San Diego, said in a statement that he applauded the federal court ruling as a \u201creaffirmation of the strength and independence of our system of justice.\u201d\n\nThe council, as a national organization, has also brought a lawsuit against Trump\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cThis decision adds to the long list of federal judges \u2014 both Republican and Democratic appointees \u2014 who found reason to block this discriminatory order,\u201d Mohebi said. \u201cThis victory should not lead to complacency. This and other Trump administration orders and policies still pose a threat to communities of color, religious minorities, women and others.\u201d\n\nNorma Chavez-Peterson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in San Diego, which is also participating in a lawsuit against the ban, called the decision \u201ca victory for our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur democracy works,\u201d Chavez-Peterson said by phone. \u201cThis is what was intended by the Constitution, that we have checks over power and not one branch of government determines everything.\n\n\u201cToday, the President got checked.\u201d\n\nAs the case moves forward, San Diego and other cities are planning to push against the White House if it appeals the 9th Circuit ruling.\n\nThe city is considering joining a legal brief in support of overturning the Trump refugee ban.\n\n\u201cSan Diego was asked by the City of Chicago to join with it in filing an amicus curiae brief in State of Washington vs. Donald Trump,\u201d San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott said in a statement. \u201cThe travel ban has consequences for San Diego \u2014 for our families, our border economy and our innovation and technology sectors. Our voice should be heard.\u201d\n\nThe City Council will consider whether to support the brief in closed session on Tuesday. Elliott needs support of five council members in order to sign-on with the brief. Meanwhile, only two of San Diego\u2019s five congressional members responded to a request for comment and reaction was mixed.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter\u2019s office said that the matter is not over, so nobody should rush to conclusions.\n\n\u201cThere's a process for legal review and until it\u2019s exhausted, we shouldn't be so quick to assume the order will stand or be reversed,\u201d said Joe Kasper, chief of staff for the Alpine Republican.\n\nHunter, who broadly supported the president\u2019s order, joined other Republicans in Congress in asking for an exemption that would allow Iraqis who served alongside the U.S. military to immigrate and the White House later accommodated their request.\n\nRep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said Trump\u2019s order was just partisan rhetoric, and that the decision shows the role the judicial branch plays in government.\n\n\u201cToday's ruling is a reminder that an independent judiciary is a cornerstone of our democracy, rooted in our Constitution, and uninfluenced by badgering and insults from even the President of the United States,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe said he wants to work with colleagues from both parties toward border and immigration policies that support both the economy and national security.\n\nCAPTION Los Angeles Unified School District has published immigration guides in English and Spanish directing families to low-cost legal resources and attorneys around L.A.
