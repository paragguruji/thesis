We can hope the answer is \"no\" \u2014 that the president will now have learned something of how government bureaucracy works, and of the impact of his decisions on real people in real time \u2014 but we fear the answer will be \"yes.\" Consider the president\u2019s insistence, in the face of criticism over the weekend, that he did nothing much different on entry to the U.S. than President Obama did in the first months of his administration. If that were indeed the case, why did Trump previously make such an issue of how different his policies were from Obama\u2019s? Can he truly believe that the chaotic scenes at airports were something manufactured by his political opponents? Trump\u2019s learning curve may be long. Let\u2019s hope that one at least exists.", "authors": ["The Times Editorial Board"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "latimes", "top_words": ["inhumane", "airport", "different", "trump", "weekend", "works", "real", "chaos", "unfair", "created", "answer", "yes", "trumps", "order", "president", "hope"], "summary": "The inescapable question is whether this is the manner in which we can expect other new presidential programs to be rolled out.\nIf that were indeed the case, why did Trump previously make such an issue of how different his policies were from Obama\u2019s?\nCan he truly believe that the chaotic scenes at airports were something manufactured by his political opponents?\nTrump\u2019s learning curve may be long.\nLet\u2019s hope that one at least exists."}
