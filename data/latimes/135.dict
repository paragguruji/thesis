(Vahid Salemi / AP)\n\nThe decision on Friday by federal Judge James Robart temporarily lifted Trump\u2019s ban against refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Two Iranian archers were among those denied visas to the U.S. to participate in a tournament in Las Vegas that begins Friday.\n\nTrump lashed out at Robart, calling the decision \u201cridiculous,\u201d and directed the Justice Department to appeal the ruling. Early Sunday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to reinstate the travel ban immediately and asked both sides to file arguments by Monday.\n\nIran and the United States have enjoyed a close relationship when it comes to wrestling, which is extremely popular in the Islamic republic. American wrestlers have attended Iran-hosted meets more than 15 times over the past three decades.\n\nThe event later this month in Kermanshah was also expected to draw teams from Russia, Ukraine and Cuba.\n\nThe foreign ministry did not say whether other Americans holding valid visas would be allowed to enter Iran. Iranian officials had previously said they would \u201ctake reciprocal measures\u201d against American nationals in response to Trump\u2019s visa ban.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
