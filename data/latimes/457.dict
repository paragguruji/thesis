Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe radical nature of this government is radicalizing Democrats, and that\u2019s going to pose a real challenge to the Democratic Party, which is to draw on the energy and the activism and the passion that is out there, but not let it turn us into what we despised about the tea party,\" Schiff said.\n\nDuring a meeting with reporters and editors in the Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau, Schiff also discussed his role as the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee under a Trump administration and how Democrats will manage in the minority.\n\nEver since the election, party leaders have been debating: \"Did we lose because we were too far to the left and we had too small a tent, or did we lose because we are too mainstream and didn\u2019t energize the base?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"We are obviously having that debate, but there\u2019s a whole new element, which is the reaction to the Trump administration that makes this different in kind, certainly different in intensity, than I think we\u2019ve ever seen after an election,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe more radical the administration is, the more radicalized our base becomes, which just feeds the Breitbart crowd, and who knows where that ends.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders have to channel public reaction to Trump's actions into progress, rather than deadlock, Schiff said.\n\nReaction to Democrats seen as working with the Trump administration has been strong. Monday night, for example, protesters marched on Sen. Dianne Feinstein's home and office voicing fears she would back Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. The senator from California announced Tuesday that she would oppose Sessions.\n\nSeveral groups calling themselves \"indivisible\" have popped up in cities across the country as focal points for efforts to organize.\n\n\u201cWe have two of the most capable strategists as the head of our House and Senate Democrats,\" Schiff added, referring to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Senate Democratic leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York.\n\n\"If anybody can grapple with this, they can, but it\u2019s going to be a challenging and moving target day to day.\"\n\n\"I just hope that we can channel that energy in a way where we can provide a check on this administration because I\u2019ve never been more worried about the country\u2019s future than I am right now,\" he said.\n\nSchiff said part of his role as the ranking Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee will be pushing back when the Trump administration puts out inaccurate information about the intelligence community and its findings.\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed or sought to minimize the intelligence community's findings that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016 election to benefit him . Schiff said he\u2019s concerned about what else the administration might be willing to dismiss.\n\n\u201cI think that will be kind of a new frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we contradict a president making representations about what the intelligence community has to say when the information is classified?\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
