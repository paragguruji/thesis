Even well-paid consultants who make their living advising bid cities acknowledge that they can never be quite sure how an upcoming selection will turn out.\n\nTo some extent, the Olympic movement exists in a bubble; many IOC members are former athletes who have spent their lives focused on sport.\n\nSo politics are not necessarily at the top of their list and they certainly have never hesitated to award the Games to countries such as Russia and China, where human rights are an issue.\n\nSome IOC voters who double as officials in specific sports might be more concerned with picking a host that provides their events with the best possible venue.\n\nOthers might see the Games from a wider perspective, looking for the city that will put on the best show or help market the Olympic movement to a broader audience.\n\nThe fact is, the 90 or so members expected to cast votes in September come from all over the world, from all walks of life, and have a wide range of priorities.\n\nHave politics impacted votes in the past?\n\nConsider recent examples: Beijing won the 2008 Summer Olympics despite widespread concerns over freedom of expression in China and Sochi staged the 2014 Winter Games amid a global controversy about gay rights in Russia.\n\nIn bidding for the 2012 Games, New York had to deal with President George W. Bush and the globally unpopular war in Iraq. Yet, when London was chosen to host those Summer Games, many experts believed another factor had far greater impact.\n\nAt the time, IOC members were unhappy with the terms of a deal they thought shared too little of the massive U.S. broadcast revenues with the rest of the world.\n\nFinances, not politics, were perceived as the sticking point. And when Chicago failed in a subsequent bid for 2016, U.S. Olympic Committee officials agreed to rework the revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\nSo which is it this time: politics or money?\n\nThe answer: a little of both.\n\nAs veteran Olympic journalist Philip Hersh pointed out in his Globetrotting blog, Trump\u2019s decision to back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership could have real economic impact in countries where numerous IOC members reside.\n\nAn aggressive stance on China by Trump and his choice for secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, come at a time when the Asian power has increasingly close ties with the IOC.\n\nOlympic leaders recently signed a long-term sponsorship deal with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba that is reportedly worth $800 million. Beijing will hold the 2022 Winter Games.\n\nAs for the political element, IOC President Thomas Bach spoke last summer about the plight of refugees, bemoaning a \u201cworld of selfishness where certain people claim to be superior to others.\u201d\n\nHis comments coincided with Trump\u2019s campaign proposals to temporarily ban Muslim immigration and deport millions of other immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Now, those proposals have started to become reality.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line for L.A.?\n\nBach wasn\u2019t the only one talking at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro last August.\n\nLA 2024 leaders heard grumbling from IOC members who think of their global organization as inclusive; they did not like Trump\u2019s positions on immigration, international trade and NATO.\n\nAnd if those members need a reason to vote against the U.S., they have a good one in hand.\n\nParis has put forth a bid that \u2014 much like L.A.\u2019s \u2014 would eliminate billions in construction by making use of existing stadiums and arenas. The mega-sporting event might have a more compact feel; L.A.\u2019s proposal spans from Santa Monica to the Inland Empire.\n\nAlso, 2024 marks 100 years since Paris last hosted the Games in 1924, so returning would make for a nostalgic story line.\n\nThe U.S. bid could make the argument that a potential second Trump term would be nearly over by 2024, but that doesn\u2019t change the present situation.\n\nAnd when IOC members make their selection next summer, they will vote in secret \u2014 the IOC insists on confidentiality to protect its members from outside pressure.\n\nWe may never know what, if any, impact Trump\u2019s presidency will have on L.A.\u2019s chances.\n\nSo far, it probably hasn\u2019t helped.\n\nCAPTION Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke previews Game 2 of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks.
