Gen. Xavier Becerra said.\n\nThe lawsuit that California joined Monday says the narrower, temporary ban on travel from six majority-Muslim countries represents unconstitutional religious discrimination. A broader executive order by President Trump had previously been put on hold by the courts.\n\n\u201cLast month, our courts put a lid on the unconstitutional and un-American Trump Muslim travel ban because Americans stood up and demanded it,\" Becerra said in a statement. \"The victory for lawful permanent residents and current visa holders was welcome news for everyone, especially the victims\u2019 families. But the fight for fair and lawful treatment of all who would seek permission to enter our country is not over.\"\n\nCalifornia is joining Washington, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Massachusetts and Minnesota in challenging the new travel order. Becerra said the changes made by the administration, which include allowing visa holders to come into the country, do not go far enough.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration may have changed the text of the now-discredited Muslim travel ban, but they didn\u2019t change its unconstitutional intent and effect,\" Becerra said. \"It is still an attack on people \u2014 women and children, professors and business colleagues, seniors and civic leaders \u2014 based on their religion and national origin.\"\n\nThe state\u2019s legal brief makes a case that California is harmed by the new travel ban. California is home to more than 10 million immigrants, welcomed almost 8,000 refugees last year, and hosts the greatest number of international students\u2014 almost 150,000 \u2014 of any state, the legal filing says.\n\nThe University of Southern California has 150-200 graduate students and post-doctoral scholars from the six affected countries each year.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order \u201csubstantially interferes with the continued matriculation of these students to California\u2019s universities and colleges,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe brief quotes UC President Janet Napolitano as saying the latest executive order\u2019s restrictions on travel are an \u201canathema to advancing knowledge and international cooperation\u201d and infringe on \u201cthe free flow of students, faculty, scholars and researchers that are at the core of the universit[ies\u2019] education, research and public service missions.\u201d\n\nThe state also alleges it will be harmed financially, noting the $681 million spent by visitors to California from the Middle East in 2015 generated sales tax of $40.8 million for the state.\n\n\u201cThe Second Executive Order will harm California by reducing investment and industry in California and decreasing travel by students, scholars, and tourists,\u201d the legal filing says.\n\n9:45 a.m.: This post was updated to include details from the legal filing and to reflect that the legal brief has been filed.\n\nThis post was originally published at 5 a.m.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-06", "authors": "Patrick McGreevy", "type": "article"}
