{"title": "Appeals court rejects Hawaii's request to let grandparents and other relatives bypass travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hawaii-judge-travel-ban-20170707-story.html", "text": "The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected a request from the state of Hawaii to expand the number of people who can bypass President Trump\u2019s travel ban, dealing one of the main challengers to the president\u2019s executive order two court losses in two days as it fights to minimize the ban\u2019s effect on travelers.\n\nThe order from the appeals court came a day after a Honolulu-based federal district judge denied the same request, saying he would not \u201cusurp\u201d Supreme Court orders that had revived a limited version of the travel ban.\n\nIn its order, a panel of three 9th Circuit judges said they \u201cdo not fault\u201d the Hawaii judge for rejecting the state\u2019s claim against how the ban is being implemented.\n\nThe judges suggested that the ban\u2019s challengers made a technical mistake in their filing in Honolulu when they asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to \u201cclarify\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions on the ban, instead of asking for \u201cinjunctive relief or to modify the injunction\u201d of the travel ban.\n\n\u201cAlthough the district court may not have authority to clarify an order of the Supreme Court, it does possess the ability to interpret and enforce the Supreme Court\u2019s order, as well as the authority to enjoin against, for example, a party\u2019s violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s order,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\nThe judges \u2014 Michael Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez \u2014 were appointed by Democratic presidents and had previously refused to reinstate the ban in June before the Supreme Court took over the case.\n\nIn his order on Thursday, Watson said those challenging the ban need to go to the Supreme Court to get clarification on whether the government is appropriately implementing it.\n\nBut in its appeal to the 9th Circuit, the state of Hawaii said that Watson was \u201csimply incorrect.\u201d\n\nAt issue is which refugees and visitors to the United States can sidestep the ban \u2014 and how to determine whether such people have \u201cclose\u201d relatives living in the United States or are associated with the country in other ways that let them bypass the ban.\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s executive order halts travel by nationals of six majority-Muslim countries and refugee resettlement from all places, it provides exceptions for those with what the Supreme Court called \u201cbona fide\u201d connections with the United States, such as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and in-law parents.\n\nBut the administration blocked grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers- and sisters-in-law. Travel ban challengers asked Watson to force the government to count all of those categories as \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. connections.\n\nBan opponents also argue that a resettlement group\u2019s interactions with a refugee constitute a bona fide relationship. The administration argues otherwise.\n\nThe Trump administration indicated after the Hawaii judge\u2019s order that it was celebrating another court win after a series of losses over the travel ban.\n\n\"If the plaintiffs elect to proceed, we are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,\" the department said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe ban, which puts a three-month pause on travel to the United States by nationals of Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen and a four-month halt to all refugee resettlement, had been blocked by federal judges since an original version of it was signed in January.\n\nThose judges included Watson, who ruled against the ban in a March case filed by the state of Hawaii. Trump administration losses in that case and another filed in a Maryland federal court were upheld in the 9th Circuit and 4th Circuit appellate courts before requests were made to the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ban.\n\nOn June 26, the Supreme Court said the ban could be put back into place with exceptions. The court suggested its move was a compromise before it heard full arguments on Trump\u2019s executive order in the fall.\n\n\u201cWe are now in the middle of a 90-day partial travel ban. The Trump administration has reserved the option to extend or even expand the travel ban at the end of it. Many felt the balance struck by the Supreme Court was nuanced and fairly reasonable, but the Trump administration has flouted the Supreme Court\u2019s order from the start,\u201d Hawaii Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin said in a statement after the state filed its appeal. \u201cWhat happens in the next several weeks matters a lot if the administration is not subject to the checks and balances of the courts.\u201d\n\nHawaii and other travel ban opponents argue that the ban unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims and is part of the president\u2019s campaign promise to suspend all Muslim immigration. The Trump administration says the president is acting within his power to ensure national security while the government develops better vetting procedures for travelers from the countries, which it says have ties to terrorism.\n\nRead the latest national headlines >> \u00bb\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
