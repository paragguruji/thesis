{"title": "A flurry of legal arguments as appeals court decides whether Trump's immigration ban will be enforced", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigration-order-legal-20170206-story.html", "text": "As a federal appeals court prepared to hear arguments Tuesday on whether to continue blocking enforcement of President Trump\u2019s moratorium on admissions from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa, a broad coalition of states, business leaders and former cabinet members joined Monday in urging the judges to keep the ban on hold.\n\nIn a torrent of court filings over the last 48 hours, representatives of 15 states and the District of Columbia, law professors, civil rights groups and industry leaders implored a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to continue blocking the ban until the constitutional issues can be resolved.\n\nAt the heart of the case are questions of whether the suspension of admissions from the seven predominantly Muslim countries amount to religious discrimination, and what limits exist to the president\u2019s broad authority to protect the country from terrorism.\n\nNone of those issues will be resolved this week by the court, which is merely ruling on whether the controversial ban can continue to be applied while the legal issues are decided.\n\nThe case landed before the court\u2019s motions panel \u2014 whose membership changes monthly \u2014 after Trump challenged a temporary restraining order issued Friday by a district judge in Washington state.\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order suspends entry to immigrants from Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Libya, and also suspends resettlement of refugees in the U.S.\n\nU.S. District Judge James L. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, acted in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota.\n\nThis month\u2019s three-member motions panel, which is likely to decide the case within the next few days, consists of appointees of Presidents Carter, Bush and Obama.\n\nThe panel will hear an hour of telephone arguments at 3 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe case, State of Washington vs. Trump, is being closely watched because the 9th Circuit could have the final word on the travel ban, at least for a while.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides not to review the 9th Circuit ruling or splits 4 to 4, the case would then go back before Robart in Seattle to decide the constitutional issues, probably on an accelerated schedule.\n\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s decision on the hold would stand until the lower court ruled on the constitutional issues.\n\nThe Trump administration argued Monday that the challengers lacked standing to bring the case because the two states that originally sued could not show their residents face immediate harm as a result of the travel ban. The Supreme Court has overturned key 9th Circuit rulings in the past on standing grounds.\n\nThe administration contends that the hold on the ban\u2019s enforcement is excessively broad because it doesn\u2019t even allow the government to exclude citizens of foreign countries who have never been in the United States.\n\n\u201cAt most, the injunction should be limited to the class of individuals on whom the state\u2019s claims rest \u2014 previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the near future,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief, appearing to repeat its earlier concession that green card holders are not among those to be included in the travel exclusions.\n\nGovernment lawyers also argued that any president has wide authority over immigration matters, especially when the chief executive is trying to protect Americans from terrorist attacks.\n\nIn rebuttal, groups opposed to the ban observed that citizens of the countries affected by it have not committed terrorism in the U.S., and many attacks have been committed by U.S. citizens.\n\nA number of former national security, foreign policy and intelligence officials \u2014 including former secretaries of State John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former defense secretary and CIA director Leon E. Panetta, and ex-national security advisor Susan Rice \u2014 argued that the moratorium was making the country less safe because it affected groups fighting alongside the U.S. in the Middle East and alienated American allies.\n\nBy attacking Muslim-majority countries, the ban was inflaming anti-Americanism and helping terrorist groups recruit new members, the former officials said.\n\nNearly 100 companies, including well-known technology firms such as Apple, Google, Twitter and Uber, argued the executive order would spur companies to move overseas to ensure they had a steady supply of talent from around the world.\n\nThe companies said the ban had already disrupted their businesses and would make it more difficult to recruit workers from overseas in the future.\n\nAlthough presidents enjoy wide power over matters of immigration, opponents of the ban told the court that Trump\u2019s order differed from the action of previous presidents in its scope and focus on countries that appeared to be chosen because of the religion of their citizens.\n\nCalifornia joined Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and the District of Columbia in written arguments against the travel ban.\n\nThe brief filed by attorneys general from these states, co-written by the office of California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra and its counterparts in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, argued Trump\u2019s order had created unbridled chaos.\n\nIf the 9th Circuit lifted the hold, \u201cIt would resurrect the chaos experienced in our airports beginning on the weekend of January 28 and 29, and cause harm to the States \u2014 including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents,\u201d the 23-page brief said.\n\nBecerra told reporters that medical school programs would \"risk being without a sufficient number of medical residents to meet staffing needs\u201d and \u201cthe process of admitting students to state colleges and universities would be disrupted.\u201d More than 2,000 California students are affected by Trump\u2019s order, he said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
