Since its signing on Friday, the measure has led to the detention of more than 100 people landing at airports across the country with valid entry documents.\n\nAbout twice as many others were denied permission to board flights to the United States, according to lawyers representing a consortium of groups that won a temporary nationwide stay Saturday night against the deportation of anyone who had arrived with a valid visa.\n\nOn the ground, backlash to the ban grew. While major international airports were the locus of protests, thousands rallied in cities including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Boston.\n\nDespite the air of gravity surrounding debate over the ban, the atmosphere at many airport rallies was raucous and cheerful. Whenever anyone was released from detention, he or she was greeted with cheers and applause from well-wishers.\n\nAt Los Angeles International Airport, thousands of protesters filled the lobby at the Tom Bradley International Terminal and spilled into the street outside, chanting, \"Let them in!\" and \"Love, not hate, makes America great.\"\n\nJacob Kemper, a 35-year-old Army veteran who served two tours in Iraq, said he was infuriated to think soldiers he fought alongside might be denied entry to the country.\n\n\"I really don't care about religion, but I really hate oppression,\" he said, holding a sign that read, \"I Fought Next To Muslims.\"\n\nShay Soltani, a network engineer, fled the Iranian revolution 40 years ago and still has family members in Iran. She joined Sunday\u2019s protest in Los Angeles, she said, because she doesn't know if she will be able to see them again, thanks to Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\"I am so hurt by this,\" she said. \"He is against freedom of speech and the Constitution and everything I believe in as an American.\"\n\nGroups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they would ultimately press to have Trump\u2019s order overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nIn the meantime, the emergency stay issued by a federal judge in Brooklyn on Saturday represented an \u201cabsolute baseline\u201d prohibiting the removal of any of those who were halted upon arrival, said Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project.\n\nBut it remained essentially the luck of the draw in terms of who was halted upon arrival, who was released after questioning, and who had access to legal counsel if detained, the lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no method to this madness,\u201d said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the groups that filed the legal challenge in New York.\n\nFor some, the directive\u2019s second full day brought a reprise of anxiety and heartbreak from the day before. Hind Mohamed traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport from New Jersey with her family, hoping to greet her mother, a green card holder traveling from Sudan.\n\nHer mother\u2019s flight had been on the ground an hour, but there was no immediate sign of her. \u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d Mohamed said, teary-eyed.\n\nHer 16-year-old son, Awab Hassan, kept a close eye out for his grandmother; he offered a teen\u2019s unvarnished take on the executive order, saying it lumped together terrorists and innocent people.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not justice \u2014 to see this country devolve, I\u2019m not proud of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the feeling of taking people in, sharing the American dream?\u201d\n\nSome turned-away arrivals eventually got through the net, with a combination of luck, ingenuity and a timely legal assist.\n\nVahideh Rasekhi, a 32-year-old Iranian linguist, was put aboard a flight in New York to head back to Tehran via Kiev, Ukraine. But because she was able to contact volunteer attorneys via smartphone \u2014even as the plane was taxiing toward takeoff \u2014a close call turned to triumph.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj \u00bb\n\nAs her friend, waiting at Kennedy airport, put it, \u201cWe found a lawyer who found a lawyer who found a lawyer.\u201d Rasekhi\u2019s plane turned back to the terminal, and the Fulbright scholar was released from detention Sunday afternoon.\n\nEven as a trickle of freed detainees gathered pace, the vigils were nerve-racking. In a haze of cigarette smoke, two Iranian friends paced a curb outside a terminal at Kennedy airport. One of them, a green card holder from Iran, had just heard that his wife, also a permanent resident, would face up to five more hours of questioning after returning from a family visit. Inside, a Turkish woman waited for her brother, worried about his rudimentary English. A Sudanese man tried to console distraught family members by phone.\n\nLos Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer, who spent the early hours of Sunday at LAX, said a woman approached him to express fears for her elderly father, who was detained and suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\"It is those kinds of real stories that are at stake because of this outrageous action\u201d by the Trump administration, he said. \"It is time not only for officials in my position, but all Americans, should find this a breathtaking violation of rights.\u201d\n\nAmong immigration activists, exchanges pinged about where best to take one\u2019s chances. At Chicago, there was said to be greater leniency in releasing those initially detained. In Boston, where a judge\u2019s order appeared to guarantee landing rights to anyone with a valid visa during the coming week, legal observers were watching for a potential increase in arrivals.\n\nAs anguish mounted among families uncertain of loved ones\u2019 fate, the Trump administration insisted enforcement of the president\u2019s directive would be unaffected by a flurry of court rulings temporarily forbidding deportation of those who arrived with valid visas.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Laura King, Barbara Demick, James Queally", "type": "article"}
