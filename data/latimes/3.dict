{"title": "After months of challenges and controversy, Trump's travel ban expires Sunday \u2014 and a new one may be coming", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-travel-ban-20170921-story.html", "text": "Days before the expiration of President Trump\u2019s much-contested travel ban, the White House is reviewing a security report that aides say could serve as the basis of a new, and perhaps broader, version.\n\nThe classified report by the Department of Homeland Security, sent to the White House last week, is a study of the available security and intelligence information in countries worldwide, not just the six Muslim-majority nations subject to Trump\u2019s order banning travel by their citizens to the United States. That order expires on Sunday.\n\nBased on the findings, Trump could decide to keep the travel ban in place, or either limit or expand it, possibly before Sunday.\n\nThe order also stopped all refugee resettlement in the U.S. for 120 days, so that ban would continue in effect for roughly a month more. The Supreme Court in June had allowed the refugee ban to take effect, with exceptions for refugees who could show a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the U.S., along with a revised travel ban for 90 days in the six specified nations.\n\nDavid Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that more countries could come under travel restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the conditions in the countries and the quality of information, and not the political or religious factors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have Muslim-majority countries that are in civil war, you have Muslim-majority countries that have major terrorism problems,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cYou could have countries that were not majority-Muslim that would have the same problems.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment, but Trump, writing on Twitter after the London train explosion last week, made it clear that he would like to put in place even broader travel restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific \u2014 but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nWhite House national security advisor H.R. McMaster on Sunday said a new travel ban would be a \u201cfirst step in better screening\u201d of who is trying to enter the country.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we\u2019re looking at \u2014 how to protect the American people better,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201dThis Week.\u201d\n\nThe security report provides an opening for the administration to try once again to reset its case for the ban, which has been under sustained attack in the federal courts ever since its helter-skelter rollout in the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nOn Jan. 27, a week after taking office, Trump signed an order banning entry to the U.S. from citizens of seven nations initially \u2014 Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq. Issued with scant notice to security agencies, the ban created confusion and protests at airports across the country before federal judges signed orders blocking its implementation.\n\nOn March 6, Trump signed a new order that dropped Iraq from the list but kept the ban in place for 90 days for the other six countries. The order instructed Homeland Security to conduct a \u201cworldwide review\u201d of security conditions to determine whether the U.S. could be confident that it could identify which travelers could pose a threat.\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed the order to take effect on June 26; the 90-day clock runs out on Sunday.\n\nLapan said it\u2019s unlikely that countries such as Syria would drop off the list. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that would happen because conditions in those countries wouldn\u2019t change that much,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump himself has added to his administration\u2019s challenges in defending the ban, starting with his call during last year\u2019s campaign for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.\u201d That allowed lawyers who opposed the measures to argue that they amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims.\n\nEven after the ban was rewritten, and the president\u2019s senior officials were telling reporters that the word \u201cban\u201d was not accurate, Trump went on Twitter to insist it was a ban. He criticized the federal courts as well as his own Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the ban on Oct. 10, but that case might be moot if the administration replaces the order with a third version.\n\nTimes staff writer Brian Bennett in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCAPTION California Atty.
