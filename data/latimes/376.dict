Gen. Ken Paxton has hailed President Trump's new executive order limiting refugee immigration and travel from six majority-Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cThe executive order issued today by President Trump is a direct response to an ongoing weakness in the refugee vetting process, which was identified to Congress by multiple federal officials, but left unaddressed by the Obama administration,\" Paxton said in a statement.\n\n\"In light of the looming threat of terrorism, the president has both the constitutional authority and solemn duty to take reasonable steps in securing our border. President Trump\u2019s action shows decisiveness in answer to a very real danger, and I appreciate his efforts to protect the safety and security of Texans and all Americans.\"\n\nPaxton had also spoken out for the first travel ban. He filed a brief in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of it after the Trump administration appealed a Seattle federal judge's Feb. 3 order calling for a nationwide halt to the first ban.\n\nOn Feb. 9, a panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit refused to reinstate the travel ban.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
