Gen. Xavier Becerra issued a statement Monday saying President Trump\u2019s decision to rescind a travel ban bogged down in court challenges \u201cconfirms what we all knew: the travel ban was unconstitutional and un-American.\u201d\n\nBecerra said his legal team will closely examine the new travel order issued Monday by Trump that reduces the targeted countries from seven to six and does not affect those who have been issued visas.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure the revised ban respects our Constitution and our way of life,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cNo one will or should soon forget the Trump Administration\u2019s multiple, public promises to ban Muslims from the country.\u201d\n\nBecerra filed amicus briefs joining Washington and other states in challenging the first order, so its repeal was hailed by the state attorney general.\n\n\u201cIt represents a major victory for the thousands of lawful permanent residents and visa holders in California, as well as all those across our nation who cherish our Constitution, diversity, tolerance, and fairness,\u201d Becerra said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-06", "authors": "Patrick McGreevy", "type": "article"}
