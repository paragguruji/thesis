They said a \u201clive dispute\u201d still remained over the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s travel ban orders, and the lower court opinions remained relevant.\n\nThe latest travel ban \u201cis an outgrowth of the president\u2019s promised Muslim ban and imposes a set of restrictions designed to fulfill that promise,\u201d said Washington attorney Neal K. Katyal, who represents Hawaii.\n\nThe skirmishing follows the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to postpone arguments on Trump\u2019s immigration power, which had been set for Oct. 10. The justices asked the lawyers for advice on what should happen next.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s lawyers said the current cases should be dismissed as moot. The ACLU and Hawaii insisted they were not moot because the essential dispute is still alive.\n\nBut a new round of litigation is already underway. A federal judge in Maryland has scheduled a hearing on the new travel order for Oct. 17.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-07", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
