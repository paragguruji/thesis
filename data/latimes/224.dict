Kelly said during an announcement at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nKelly spoke alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions. None took questions. The briefings they spoke about were all done off-camera. And, in the case of the media briefing, the administration did not allow officials to be quoted by name.\n\nThe tightly orchestrated unveiling speaks to the sensitivity around the order. The first version was blocked in the courts. Trump signed Monday's order behind closed doors, in contrast to the public show he has made when signing other directives in front of television cameras.\n\nThe three administration officials' comments seemed designed to help the new order withstand judicial scrutiny. All three said Trump was acting in his duty to protect the country. Kelly invoked the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\u201dThose attacks taught us that we cannot take our nation\u2019s security for granted,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nSessions pointed to the Constitution. \u201cOur founders wisely gave the president the authority and the duty to defend our nation,\u201d he said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
