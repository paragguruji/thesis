Tech workers came and went over the course of the four-hour rally.\n\nThe rally follows a recent surge in political activism in the tech industry, which historically has been hesitant to weigh in on issues not pertaining to its business interests. Tech workers have loudly protested Trump\u2019s executive orders on travel and migrants, pledged to never help build a Muslim or immigrant database and developed apps to facilitate donations to nonprofits.\n\nThere have been protests outside the office of secretive technology firm Palantir and the home of its co-founder, Peter Thiel, over concerns the company might assist the government in building databases to be used in the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nSome tech workers have organized hackathons to connect the industry with nonprofits in need.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
