The same panel on Monday ruled that the appeal will proceed.\n\nTrump has said he will sign a new executive order \"tailored\" to deal with court decisions that have largely gone against him. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said he expected the order to be issued mid-week.\n\nSpicer has said Trump wants to fight for the current order while also issuing a new one, but the Justice Department has said in multiple court filings that the the current order will be undone after a new one is issued.\n\nThe states of Washington and Minnesota, which brought the case in Seattle now under review, have pushed for courts to move forward on a review of the constitutional issues.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
