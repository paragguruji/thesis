The order covers most of the same countries, with Chad and North Korea joining Iran, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Libya on the list and Sudan moving off it. The restrictions also differ in severity among countries and place sharper scrutiny on some nationals from Somalia, Iraq and Venezuela. How this affects the Supreme Court case involving the temporary ban isn\u2019t clear, but legal challenges to the new one are sure to follow.\n\nThe Battle on Bended Knee\n\nThey knelt. They linked arms. They stayed in the locker room. Across the NFL, as the national anthem was sung on Sunday, players and some owners had a message for President Trump: You can\u2019t tell us what to do. This unusual 1st Amendment discussion started Friday night at a political rally, when Trump said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you\u2019d say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He\u2019s fired.\u2019 \u201d Then, on Twitter, the president took the ball and ran with it, including lashing out at NBA star Stephen Curry for saying he didn\u2019t want to visit the White House. But just as many business leaders backed off Trump because of his response to a white-supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., so too did many NFL owners this time, including two who donated $1 million each to his inauguration. In the parking lot of StubHub Center in Carson, fans had some things to say on both sides of the debate.\n\nMichael Dwyer / Associated Press Several New England Patriots players kneel during the national anthem before a Sept. 24 game against the Houston Texans in Foxborough, Mass.

That much is clear about the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill. But there\u2019s been virtually no analysis or public scrutiny. There\u2019s disagreement over a key point, with cosponsor Sen. Bill Cassidy saying it protects those with preexisting conditions \u2014 and a long list of healthcare groups saying it doesn\u2019t. With a vote as early as Wednesday and key senators expressing doubts about the bill, billions of dollars have been added in the hope it will sway them.\n\nThinking the Unthinkable: What a New Korean War Would Look Like\n\nAs the world watches the insults and threats fly between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, military strategists are pondering what was once unthinkable after 64 years of armistice: all-out war. They say a conflict, even if restricted to conventional weapons, would differ greatly from the Korean War of the 1950s and what we\u2019ve seen more recently in Iraq or Libya. \u201cThere is only one way that this war ends: with North Korea\u2019s defeat \u2014 but at what cost?\u201d says one retired Air Force brigadier general.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s Mettle Is Tested\n\nAcross Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.4 million, communities were struggling to survive without even the most basic necessities after deadly Hurricane Maria. A failing dam in the island\u2019s northwest forced evacuations. But amid the devastation, neighbors found a way to come together, whether trying to salvage what they could, playing basketball without electric lighting or breaking into prayer to celebrate their survival \u2014 and wonder what comes next.\n\nNot Everyone in Anaheim Feels That Disney Magic\n\nAs Anaheim\u2019s largest employer and taxpayer, the Walt Disney Co. has been central to what the city is today. But some local politicians and residents wonder why they aren\u2019t seeing more benefits to living in Disneyland\u2019s shadow. Case in point: a big parking structure, which the city owns and spent $108.2 million to build as part of a deal for the Disney Resort\u2019s expansion. The city gets just $1 a year, while Disney collects millions in parking fees.\n\nOUR MUST-READS FROM THE WEEKEND\n\n-- Senior aides to President Trump repeatedly warned him not to deliver a personal attack on North Korea\u2019s leader at the United Nations, but he didn\u2019t heed their advice.\n\n-- The University of California is handing out generous pensions, and students are paying the price with higher tuition.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
