They won\u2019t let you into America.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many rules,\u201d he said, laughing to ease his nerves. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\nIt was true, the part about so many rules. The fate of Abdullah\u2019s trip, and his future as a student in the U.S., was changing by the hour, thanks to the confusion sown by President Trump \u2019s executive order on travel and the multiple rulings against it.\n\nAbdullah Al-Rifaie, 19, has lived in Southern California for the last year and a half, attending classes on a student visa. He left Los Angeles in December on winter break to renew his visa \u2014 to follow the rules. But in the few weeks it took for him to successfully get his paperwork processed in Jordan, Trump signed the executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, including the one that issued Abdullah\u2019s passport, Iraq.\n\nThe order had an immediate effect on the travel plans of Abdullah and of many far more desperate than him \u2014 refugees and asylum seekers whose lives were in danger in their home countries.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": "Lorraine Ali", "type": "article"}
