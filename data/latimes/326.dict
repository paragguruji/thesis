Trump nominated Cabinet secretaries, and the Republican-led Senate, the only part of the legislative branch with a role in these opening days, pushed them past Democratic opposition.\n\nThe court decision was a reminder to the president that the success of his administration will also be driven by the views of jurists who represent the third center of power under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAnd it was a reminder of how Trump, and his inability to curb his impulses, can pose a threat to his own goals.\n\nTweets and comments from the president that were once seen as merely inflammatory and insulting, such as his campaign pledge to enact a ban on all Muslims seeking to come to the U.S., took on more power when cited as evidence before the courts. Trump\u2019s words cut against the Justice Department\u2019s argument that the president\u2019s executive order did not amount to an unconstitutional ban on any particular religion.\n\nThe court also provided a rebuttal to the bleak worldview Trump has promoted through exaggerations and falsehoods about safety threats at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThe government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\nTrump contributed to the court\u2019s rebuke by adopting, in his early weeks as president, a shock-and-awe strategy that put a premium on speed and secrecy rather than thoughtful deliberation. In the case of the executive order, issued one week after he took office, that meant the administration bypassed review by agencies that might have helped the plan meet judicial muster.\n\nFriday, in the aftermath of the loss in court, administration officials said they were considering a new executive order designed to fix the main problems of the original \u2014 a tacit admission of problems with how the order had been written and carried out.\n\nTrump came into office bent on upending politics, and his actions have been meant to further that image. Swift, unilateral behavior \u2014 and sharp rejoinders to anyone not going along \u2014 have been his hallmarks.\n\nWhile that has kicked up controversy, Trump has succeeded in early tests of strength because his power over Capitol Hill has been nearly complete. The president is hardly a conservative ideologue, but he shares goals important to the Republican majorities in both houses, such as tax cuts for business and upper-income earners and the repeal of President Obama\u2019s healthcare plan. And that has kept them in line.\n\nWith a firm hold on the most activist and energized voters in the Republican base, Trump also represents a potential threat to the political ambitions of Republicans who might want to publicly disagree with him.\n\nAfter a rocky confirmation hearing, his Education secretary, Republican donor Betsy DeVos, was approved with only two GOP defections and Vice President Mike Pence breaking a Senate tie. His attorney general, former Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, survived furious Democratic objections on the Senate floor with even less GOP wobbling.\n\nThat loyalty and a provocative sense of siege have propelled his administration\u2019s first few weeks. Trump has worked to create the sense he first floated in the campaign that only he can solve the nation\u2019s problems and that any entity that threatens his political power is illegitimate.\n\nAs president, he has crafted that alternative universe from his first inaugural words, when he cast a dark vision of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d afoot in the land, of gangs and criminals and the imminent threat of terrorist attacks.\n\nHe declares almost daily that the media are dishonest and out to get him, even when his allegations are disproved by video. He has cast reporters as effectively treasonous for intentionally hiding incidents of terrorism \u2014 an accusation that is false.\n\nFor more on politics \u00bb\n\n\u201cThey have their reasons and you understand that,\u201d Trump told military service members in Florida this week, speaking of the media. (His staff later released a lengthy list of supposedly ignored attacks, many of which had, in fact, been covered extensively.)\n\nHe also went after U.S. Dist. Judge James L. Robart, the Seattle-based jurist who initially blocked his travel ban, in an echo of his attacks last year on a judge handling a legal case against Trump\u2019s former real estate school.\n\n\u201cThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart,\u201d Trump tweeted this week. \u201cBad people are very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d\n\nAs the appellate panel indicated in its judgment, Trump provided no proof that people born in the countries listed in the travel order represented an imminent threat.\n\nBut his rhetoric remains consistent.\n\nIn the last 10 days \u2014 half the length of his presidency \u2014 Trump has taken on judges and the media, demeaned his political opponents as paid provocateurs, threatened to strip federal funds from California, insulted Australia, a U.S. ally, and cast aspersions on an American company, Nordstrom, for its decision to stop selling a fashion line by his daughter Ivanka.\n\nOn Thursday, apparently angered that Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut had made public some remarks by his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, that were critical of Trump, the president raised Blumenthal\u2019s past exaggeration of his service during the Vietnam War.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Cathleen Decker", "type": "article"}
