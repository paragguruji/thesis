Some in conservative media are viewing it as a much-needed political victory for Trump.\n\nHere are some of Thursday\u2019s headlines:\n\nTwo wins for Trump (Washington Times)\n\nTrump has seen setbacks in his fledgling administration \u2013 probes into possible collusion with Russia, infighting among his party over a healthcare overhaul, federal courts halting his travel ban. But now, the president gets a W.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow portions of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to proceed is a much-needed victory for the administration,\u201d Cal Thompson writes. \u201cIn doing so the unanimous court affirmed \u2014 at least temporarily, pending a full hearing on the case in the fall \u2014 a president\u2019s constitutional authority to determine whether people seeking admittance to the U.S. pose a threat to our safety and security.\u201d\n\nThompson also highlights the Supreme Court decision this week that churches have the same right as other charitable groups to seek state money for new playground surfaces and other non-religious needs. Thompson called the ruling in the case, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer, a victory for religious institutions and Trump, who at times has touched on the issue of religious freedom.\n\nBreitbart prods GOP leaders to pass 'pro-American' immigration reforms (Breitbart)\n\nFor Trump, Breitbart hasn\u2019t always delivered the most approving headlines for his administration \u2013 particularly on immigration. Some right-wing bloggers and pundits don\u2019t think Trump has done enough on immigration, a key pillar of his campaign platform.\n\nThis piece turns the attention to members of Congress, where two bills \u2013 focused primarily on detaining people in the country illegally \u2013 could come up for a vote .\n\n\u201cThe GOP-run House is expected to vote for two modest immigration-reform bills as soon as this week, but pro-American reformers are using the two votes to build loud and energetic public pressure for major reform legislation,\u201d notes the right-wing website.\n\nTrump attacks 'Psycho' Joe Scarborough, 'Crazy' Mika Brzezinski in Twitter tear (Fox News)\n\nAt first, they were friends; now, perhaps, enemies?\n\nTrump used Twitter early Thursday to jab \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who the president in past has said he admires.\n\nThe tweets have drawn the ire of Republicans.
