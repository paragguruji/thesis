Trump referred at one point to the \"so-called judge\" who had granted the restraining order at issue in today's 9th Circuit hearing.\n\n\"There's no question the president respects the judicial branch and its ruling,\" Spicer said. But, \"I don't think there's any other way that you can interpret that, that the president has the discretion to do what's necessary to keep this country safe.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Michael A.
