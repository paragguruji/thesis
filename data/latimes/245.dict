Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday that the list will include names of individuals who have \u201cdemonstrated their commitment\u201d to helping the United States.\n\n\u201cEven people that are doing seemingly benign things in support of us \u2014 whether as a linguist, a driver, anything else \u2014 they often do that at great personal risk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people who take these risks are really making a tangible signal of support to the United States, and that\u2019s something that will, and should be, recognized.\"\n\nThe list would not require any changes to the president\u2019s order, but rather serve as guidance to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House in implementing the new policy.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer later pushed back against blanket exemptions.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that people have served this country, we should make sure that in those cases they're helped out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass.\u201d\n\nTrump, who signed the order at the Pentagon on Friday, did not consult Defense Secretary James N. Mattis or Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the temporary suspensions of entry to visitors from the seven nations, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe executive action put the U.S. military in a difficult position because it works closely with the Iraqi government on a range of issues, including the fight against Islamic State, which necessitates travel between the two countries.\n\nFor instance, Iraqi military pilots train to fly F-16 fighter jets at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. It's not clear those pilots, who are active in the fight against Islamic State, could arrive in the U.S. for the training.\n\n1:10 p.m.: This post was updated with White House response.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "W.J.
