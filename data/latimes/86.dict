{"title": "Airlines caught by Trump travel ban forced to adjust on the fly", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-airlines-travel-ban-20170130-story.html", "text": "The travel ban imposed by President Trump has had a minor impact on U.S.-based airlines but has forced foreign airlines to scramble, even prompting one carrier to switch out a flight crew to comply with the action.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order to temporarily bar travelers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya has sparked protests at some major airports, causing several flight delays. There were no reports of canceled flights.\n\nAt Los Angeles International Airport, a total of 15 flights \u2014 six international flights and nine domestic flights \u2014 were delayed Sunday because flight crews and passengers were hampered getting past protesters to their gates.\n\nNo U.S.-based carrier flies directly to any of the seven countries listed in the temporary ban, and visitors from those countries make up only a fraction of all visitors to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe travel volume between the U.S. and the affected countries is not very large compared to the volume to other places,\u201d said Jan Brueckner, an economics professor at UC Irvine and expert on the airline industry. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge thing.\u201d\n\nBut other experts worry that the ban may send a message that the U.S. is not as welcoming to foreign tourists as it was in the past.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. is viewed as a hostile environment, not a welcoming destination, we will see fewer international visitors this year,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, an industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.\n\nThat could be a major blow to the nation\u2019s travel industry, which supports 15.1 million jobs.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Assn., the trade group for the nation\u2019s travel industry, said it hopes that the Trump administration does not delay reviewing the procedures for approving visas from the seven countries. The executive order keeps out refugees for 120 days and travelers from the seven predominantly Muslim nations out for three months.\n\n\u201cThe real trouble would come if the chaos and confusion is protracted,\u201d said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president at the association.\n\nU.S. carriers said they are rebooking and offering full refunds to travelers who had to cancel flights to the U.S. For those travelers who landed in the U.S. with a one-way ticket and were forced by the executive order to fly back, the airlines picked up the cost of the return flight.\n\nThe biggest impact of the ban has been on foreign-based airlines, which complained that Trump\u2019s executive order caught them by surprise.\n\n\u201cThe executive order was issued without prior coordination or warning, causing confusion among both airlines and travelers,\u201d the International Air Transport Assn., said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt also placed additional burdens on airlines to comply with unclear requirements, to bear implementation costs and to face potential penalties for non-compliance.\u201d\n\nThe trade group represents 265 airlines worldwide, including Qatar, Emirates, Etihad and Iran Air, carriers that fly out of some of the countries named in the ban.\n\nEmirates Airline, the world\u2019s largest long-haul carrier with 17 flights a day to the U.S. , said it was forced to change pilots and flight attendants on some flights to the U.S. to keep from violating the new ban. Trump\u2019s executive order did not exclude airline crew members with passports from those countries named in the ban.\n\nEmirates declined to elaborate on the staff changes, saying only: \u201cWe have made the necessary adjustments to our crewing, to comply with the latest requirements. Emirates continues to operate flights to the U.S. as scheduled.\u201d\n\nTravel from the Middle East and Africa represents only about 5% of all overseas visitors to the U.S., according to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Mexico, Canada and Europe represent the biggest markets for foreign tourism to the U.S.\n\nStill, the travel ban continued to spark controversy.\n\nA Los Angeles travel agent who specializes in booking trips for Iranian Americans said her clients are afraid to leave the U.S. for fear that they cannot return. \u201cEven Iranian-Americans, they don\u2019t want to go anywhere,\u201d said Nancy Amiri of Amiri Travel.\n\nSuiteness, an online travel site, announced that in response to the temporary ban it has removed all of Trump\u2019s hotels from its travel site.\n\n\u201cAs supporters of diversity and the collective strength of the human spirit, we at Suiteness refuse to profit off of Trump Hotel listings while innocents suffer because of this executive action,\u201d said Robbie Bhathal, chief executive of Suiteness.\u200b\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
