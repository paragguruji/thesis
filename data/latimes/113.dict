Instead, he said his administration planned to unveil a new executive order designed to limit the ability of people who might be associated with terrorism to enter the United States.\n\nThe ban blocked by the 9th Circuit prevented citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for three months, leading to the cancelation of at least 60,000 visas.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order nationwide against enforcement of the ban in response to a suit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota. The government appealed to the 9th Circuit.\n\nA three-judge panel of two Democratic appointees and one appointed by a Republican unanimously agreed that the ban was likely to violate constitutional guarantees of due process.\n\nFollowing that decision, an unidentified 9th Circuit judge asked that an 11-judge panel be convened to review the ruling.\n\nBut in an order late Thursday, the court said that in light of the upcoming new executive order, it would pause its proceedings \"pending further order of this court.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
