{"title": "The real goal of Trump's executive orders: Reduce the number of immigrants in the U.S.", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-foreigners-20170228-story.html", "text": "Behind President Trump\u2019s efforts to step up deportations and block travel from seven mostly Muslim countries lies a goal that reaches far beyond any immediate terrorism threat: a desire to reshape American demographics for the long term and keep out people who Trump and senior aides believe will not assimilate.\n\nIn pursuit of that goal, Trump in his first weeks in office has launched the most dramatic effort in decades to reduce the country\u2019s foreign-born population and set in motion what could become a generational shift in the ethnic makeup of the U.S.\n\nTrump and top aides have become increasingly public about their underlying pursuit, pointing to Europe as an example of what they believe is a dangerous path that Western nations have taken. Trump believes European governments have foolishly allowed Muslims with extreme views to settle in their countries, sowing seeds for unrest and recruitment by terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cTake a look at what's happening in Sweden. Take a look at what's happening in Germany. Take a look at what's happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris,\u201d Trump said Friday during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, referring to riots last week in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood in Stockholm, as well as attacks and unrest in similar neighborhoods in Germany and France over the last few years.\n\nTrump is also expected to talk about the need for stringent security during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. And he is likely to issue a new travel ban this week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday.\n\nCritics of Trump\u2019s travel ban, including several federal judges who have blocked it, have pointed to a lack of evidence that immigrants from the seven countries have engaged in terrorist acts in the U.S. Trump\u2019s aides see a lack of trouble so far in the U.S. as having little relevance.\n\nTwo days after Trump imposed the ban, a senior administration official told reporters at the White House that the order was part of a larger strategy to develop an immigration system that selects immigrants the White House believes will make \u201cpositive contributions\u201d to the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it\u2019s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,\u201d the official said.\n\nPresident Obama and his aides also sometimes contrasted the relative lack of terrorism in the U.S. experience with the higher level of violence in Europe. But they attributed the difference to America having done a better job than European countries of assimilating foreign-born residents.\n\nTrump and his aides do not accept that. In their eyes, the U.S. has been spared mostly because its Muslim population remains much smaller than that of France, Germany or other European nations. Muslims make up about 7.5% of the French population, but only about 1% in the U.S., according to estimates by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\u201cForeign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cTake a look at what's happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can't let it happen to us,\u201d he said.\n\nBut U.S. demographics have been changing rapidly \u2014 and undesirably in the eyes of top Trump aides, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and domestic policy advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nInside the West Wing, the two men have pushed an ominous view of refugee and immigration flows, telling other policymakers that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate marginalized immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to plotters of terrorist attacks in recent years, according to a White House aide familiar with the discussions.\n\nThey point to shifts in immigration in the U.S. over the past century to make their case.\n\nIn 1960, 84% of migrants to the U.S. came from Europe or Canada, a bubble that was largely a result of the Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted the migration of Italians and Eastern European Jews and essentially banned the immigration of Arabs and Asians.\n\nOnce the U.S. immigration system was revamped in 1960s to be more open to people from around the world, Europeans declined sharply as a share of those migrating to the U.S. By 2014, the most recent year figures are available, that share had dropped to 13.6%.\n\nImmigrants from Asia made up the largest share with 26.4%.\n\nThat\u2019s a trend Trump criticized long before he began linking it to the risk of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI say to myself, why aren't we letting people in from Europe?\u201d he asked during a speech at CPAC four years ago. \u201cNobody wants to say it \u2014 but I have many friends from Europe. They want to come in. People I know. Tremendous people. Hardworking people. They can't come in,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\nBut his argument ignores other big changes in society, critics note.\n\n\u201cIf you were going to say, 'We don't like that equalization we did in 1965, we need to go back,' that is going back to a time when the United States was more overtly racist,\u201d said Tanya Golash-Boza, a sociology professor at UC Merced who studies immigration and race.\n\nAt the same time that the European share of migration has dropped, the overall foreign-born share of the U.S. population has increased, quadrupling in the five decades since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act took effect. In 1960, the U.S. had 9.7 million foreign-born residents. In 2014, it had 42.2 million.\n\nThat change has alarmed right-wing nationalists like Miller and Bannon, who see Trump\u2019s administration as an opportunity to change those migration trends for decades to come.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
