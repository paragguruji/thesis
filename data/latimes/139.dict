That panel\u2019s decision can then be appealed to an 11-judge en banc panel or to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit will hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of a Hawaii judge\u2019s national injunction against the travel ban during a May 15 hearing in Seattle.\n\nThe U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is reviewing a more limited injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order, decided without being asked to go directly to en banc review. The Virginia-based court has scheduled a hearing for May 8.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-30", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
