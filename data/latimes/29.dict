L.A.'s Iranian community on edge over Trump travel rules", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-iranians-travel-ban-20170629-story.html", "text": "A revived version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban expected to take effect late in the day is sparking new fears in Los Angeles\u2019 large Iranian community.\n\nAmeena Mirza Qazi, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, said immigration rights attorneys are still \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the travel ban, even in its restricted form.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of confusion about how this affects people, how this affects family members,\u201d Qazi said. \u201cCommunity members are extremely concerned. The [visa] process is already so thorough and it\u2019s been that way for a very long time. To say someone can\u2019t come in because they\u2019re from a certain country\u2026 we know what this is about. This is about excluding Muslims as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAfter the Supreme Court partially restored the executive order that had been blocked by courts, the Trump administration set new criteria for visa applicants from six majority-Muslim nations, requiring a \"close\" business or family tie to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that it needs the travel pause while it reviews and revises its vetting procedures for people arriving from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Trump has argued that the countries have ties to terrorism and that the ban will better protect the U.S. against terror attacks.\n\nGuidelines sent to embassies and consulates around the globe do not count grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiances or other extended family members as \u201cclose\u201d relations. The rules apply for 90 days to people from the six countries and 120 days for refugees from any country. Visas that have already been approved will not be revoked.\n\nQazi said attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild and other organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American Civil Liberties Union, will monitor how customs officials treat travelers to determine \u201cwhether they are overzealous in their implementation and whether there are any unforeseen impacts locally.\u201d\n\nCivil rights lawyers are heading back to LAX as the new version of Trump's travel ban takes effect \u00bb\n\nBecause attorneys are not allowed behind the scenes during customs inspections, she said, they rely heavily on family members waiting at the airport to tell them whether someone has been detained for an extended period.\n\nQazi said the ban may affect one of her interns, whose family is from Iran.\n\n\u201cHer grandmother wanted to go back to Iran to visit family. After the Muslim ban, they were very afraid things could change on a dime, so they wanted to wait and see,\u201d Qazi said.\n\nXena Amirani, the intern, said her grandmother died recently, and her mother was having a hard time dealing with the stress of losing a loved one. Amirani\u2019s aunt was supposed to visit from Iran to help the family manage.\n\n\u201cI was pretty worried because I didn\u2019t realize there were exceptions for family members,\u201d Amirani, 18, said.\n\nHer aunt doesn\u2019t have a green card, she said, so she thought the ban would ruin their plans.\n\n\u201cI was really worried and concerned and I called my parents,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter reading up on the ban, she realized it put in place exceptions for certain \u201cbona fide relationships,\u201d including siblings.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s within this restriction I\u2019m not too worried about it,\u201d Amirani said. \u201cBut if the Supreme Court rules in the fall that the original version of the ban is constitutional, then I\u2019m going to be concerned.\u201d\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif went on Twitter on Tuesday to criticize the executive order: \u201cA bigoted ban on Muslims will not keep US safer. Instead of policies empowering extremists, US should join the real fight against them.\u201d\n\nJamal Abdi, policy director for the National Iranian American Council, said even a limited version of the travel ban stands to separate families that have come to rely on visits from their loved ones in Iran because they are unable to travel to the Islamic Republic.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian community, many of us are first- or second-generation,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cA lot of our families are still in Iran.... Many of us can\u2019t go to Iran. Now, we see both governments punishing the people who are stuck in the middle and that means families are now being torn apart.\u201d\n\nAbdi recalled the case of an Iranian man who was barred from coming to the U.S. to visit his newborn grandson for the first time during the initial travel ban in January. The man was stopped at the airport and wasn\u2019t allowed to board the plane. This second ban, Abdi said, will lead to more such cases.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim ban is largely on hold,\u201d Abdi said, \u201cbut we are seeing that element of it made permanent.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
