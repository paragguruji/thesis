After his fee payments were accepted and her visa was approved, the 38-year-old flew to Africa last week to retrieve the girl.\n\nBut on Saturday, as the father and daughter waited to board a flight at a Djibouti airport, his daughter was stopped and blocked because of Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning citizens and refugees from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nAli and his daughter are now stuck in Djibouti, waiting to hear whether they can reenter the U.S., according to their lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe is understandably distressed and frustrated because everything is uncertain,\u201d said his attorney, Katy Lewis. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a path to get them on a plane yet.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, several immigration groups filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit on behalf of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, including Ali and his daughter, challenging Trump\u2019s ban. The lawsuit asserts that Trump\u2019s executive order violates the statutory prohibition against discrimination and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed in federal district court in Washington, attorneys argued that \u201cthere is a real possibility that the United States will not permit [Ali\u2019s daughter] to enter the United States, along with her U.S. citizen father, to join her U.S. citizen mother and her two U.S. citizen sisters.\u201d\n\nHis daughter\u2019s visa had been approved a day before Trump signed the order, barring immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAli and his family moved to the U.S. from Yemen in 2004, but they returned to the country not long after because his wife\u2019s mother was ill. While in Yemen, Eman was born.\n\nCongressman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) has pleaded to do \u201ceverything within our jurisdiction to help Mr. Ali and his daughter to get home as soon as possible and safely.\u201d\n\nCalling the president\u2019s order \u201cflawed policy,\u201d Costa said, \u201cIt has the potential to be ruled unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nLewis said she is working with the congressman to obtain a travel letter, exempting the family from the order. But so far, she said she hasn\u2019t had any luck.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Djibouti has told Lewis they are waiting for further guidance from the U.S. officials to determine whether they can issue the letter to Ali and his daughter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just particularly upsetting that she can\u2019t enter the U.S. and rejoin her family, who are U.S. citizens,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nLewis has been working with Ali\u2019s family for several years to help Eman with her visa. Because she lived in Yemen, Eman and her family went through extensive vetting and encountered several hurdles at embassies in the war-torn country, she said. If the girl is allowed to enter the U.S., she would immediately be allowed to become a citizen because she is a minor and her parents are citizens, Lewis said.\n\nBut for now, the status of Eman\u2019s return remains in limbo.\n\nAli is the sole breadwinner for his family and works as a manager at Buy N Save Market in Los Banos, his attorney said. His wife, 14-year-old daughter and nearly 2-year-old daughter remain at home in Los Banos, eagerly awaiting their return.\n\nMeanwhile, Ali and his daughter are stuck in a hotel in Djibouti, according to Lewis, where they have no family and no clue what their future holds.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
