Our beliefs anchor us to understand that a transgression on one person is a transgression on us all.\"\n\nThe difficulty in getting through to swamped legislative offices is heartening, in a way, Afzal said.\n\n\"You have all these people who have come together in solidarity and support, and are ready to go to the distance on these issues,\" she said.\n\nUsmani said the effort won't end with letter-writing. The organizers will ask for a town hall meeting with elected officials.\n\nThe organizers hope for a large, diverse turnout.\n\n\"Strength is in our numbers,\" Usmani said. \"That's why it is important for us to invite and work with the many diverse communities in the greater Lehigh Valley.\"\n\nOnline: https://www.facebook.com/events/331365073926388/\n\nDETAILS\n\nLetter Writing Campaign for Justice\n\n\u2022When: 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday\n\n\u2022Where: Muslim Association of the Lehigh Valley, 1988 Schadt Ave., Whitehall Township\n\n\u2022Requested from participants: Pens, postcards, letter paper, envelopes", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Dan Sheehan", "type": "article"}
