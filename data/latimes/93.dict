The day before, another U.S. district judge in Hawaii handed down a similar decision, which the administration has appealed to the 9th Circuit Court on the grounds it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cfundamentally wrong.\u201d\n\nThe two appeals \u2014 before the 4th Circuit on Monday and the 9th Circuit in Seattle on May 15 \u2014 set the stage for what may be an early decision from the Supreme Court on the scope of Trump\u2019s power over immigration, assuming the circuit courts\u2019 decisions are appealed by the losing side.\n\nAt issue is whether the president has essentially a free hand to restrict foreigners from entering the country or if his power is limited by the Constitution\u2019s protections for due process of law and religious freedom.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers are not likely to find a friendly forum in the two appellate courts. Both have a solid majority of Democratic appointees. And 4th Circuit may hear the case without its most prominent Republican appointee, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who is expected to recuse himself because his son-in-law, acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall, is arguing for the government.\n\nThe administration\u2019s lawyers are likely more focused on getting the case to the Supreme Court, where they have reason to be confident with the arrival of new Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, restoring the court\u2019s 5-4 majority of Republican appointees.\n\nFor their part, those challenging the president\u2019s executive order say it remains a scaled-down version of the Muslim ban that Trump promised during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe think the case is not complicated. The question is whether it is consistent with the Constitution that the government can condemn you because of your religion,\u201d said Omar C. Jadwat, an ACLU attorney who is arguing the case in the 4th Circuit.\n\nIn the first round of this litigation, Trump and his new legal team suffered an early knockdown. On Jan. 27, after one week in office, the president issued an executive order restricting foreign travel that was immediate, sweeping and confusing. It led to chaotic scenes in airports when foreign students, professors, tech engineers and family members who were living or working in this country were caught off guard when they returned from overseas.\n\nA wave of lawsuits followed, and a week later a judge in Seattle put the executive order on hold. The 9th Circuit upheld his decision on Feb. 9, dealing the Trump White House a major legal defeat in its third week on the job.\n\nTrump\u2019s team retreated and then issued a significantly scaled-back version on March 6. It temporarily suspends entry of foreign nationals from six countries (Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen). And unlike the first and more sweeping order, the new ban \u201caffects only foreign nationals who are outside the United States and lack a visa,\u201d the administration said, and these \u201cindividuals have no constitutional rights regarding their admission.\u201d\n\nBut those arguments failed to sway the two district judges. In Maryland, Judge Theodore Chuang said several plaintiffs had standing because they had relatives in the six countries who could be affected by Trump\u2019s order. He cited Trump\u2019s campaign statements as evidence of the president\u2019s \u201canimus toward Muslims.\u201d\n\nHis words \u201cpresent a convincing case that the first executive order was issued to accomplish, as nearly as possible, President Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban,\u201d he wrote in his March 16 decision. \u201cThese statements continue to explain the religious purpose behind the travel ban in the second executive order.\u201d He suspended enforcement of order on the grounds it \u201cviolates the Establishment Clause\u201d of the 1st Amendment, which he said prevents the government from favoring one religion over another.\n\nJudge Derrick Watson in Hawaii also agreed with plaintiffs that the revised travel ban was \u201cmotivated by anti-Muslim bias\u201d and therefore violated the 1st Amendment.\n\nThe two sides in the dispute spent quite a bit of time arguing over a 2005 Supreme Court decision that struck down display of the Ten Commandments inside county buildings in McCreary County, Ky.\n\nWhen the ACLU first sued over the plaques featuring the commandments, the county responded by adding framed copies of the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Mayflower Compact and the lyrics of the Star Spangled Banner. Attorney for the county then argued in court that these displays were about the \u201cfoundations of American law,\u201d not about promoting religion.\n\nJustice David Souter, writing for the high court, said judges are not so easily fooled. \u201cReasonable observers have reasonable memories,\u201d he said, and they need not \u201cturn a blind eye to the context\u201d of the legal dispute.\n\nHis opinion in turn was cited by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the matter, and by the two district judges, as the basis for saying courts should not ignore what might be the underlying purpose behind Trump\u2019s revised travel ban targeting the six Muslim majority nations.\n\nThe administration\u2019s lawyers insist that the dispute has nothing to do with religion. \u201cThe order does not convey a religious message. It no longer contains any reference to religion, and its secular, national-security purpose is set forth at length,\u201d they said in their appeal.\n\nFurther, it is a mistake, they said, to \u201csimply plop Establishment Clause cases from the domestic context,\u201d involving local religious displays, and extend them to matters of \u201cforeign policy, national security and the immigration judgments of the president.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
