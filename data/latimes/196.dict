For others, he said, \"we will have a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don't get on airplanes.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on whether this would apply to green card holders as well.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Associated Press", "type": "article"}
