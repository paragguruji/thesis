It appears to set the stage for a battle in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which last month upheld a ruling blocking Trump\u2019s original travel ban.\n\nThe case, brought by Hawaii Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin, argued that the latest travel ban would have \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on residents, businesses and universities. In its complaint, the state of Hawaii also said the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nLawyers for the state also argued that the order illegally discriminates based upon nationality.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
