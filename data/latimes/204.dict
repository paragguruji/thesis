As part of the agreement, the two countries reopened embassies in each other\u2019s capitals.\n\nRestrictions on American agricultural and telecommunications equipment to Cuba were eased, and it became much easier for Americans to travel to Cuba as regular air travel between the countries was restored.\n\nIn turn, airlines and U.S. hotel chains began investing resources in Cuba, while chicken, grain and other agricultural producers from the U.S. exported tons of products to Cuba. Cubans, who had little access to the Internet, also found themselves able to browse online.\n\nMoreover, Obama\u2019s efforts allowed Americans to use credit and debit cards in the country and to send money to relatives in Cuba from the United States. Last year, Obama traveled to Cuba, becoming the first U.S. president in nearly a century to visit the island.\n\nWhat did Trump say about it?\n\nAs a private citizen, Trump criticized the effort.\n\nThis flowed over into last year\u2019s campaign, with Trump vowing to terminate the agreement. In the weeks after his election victory, Trump forcefully hinted at his plans for Cuba.\n\n\u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEasing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people \u2014President Trump, speaking in Miami\n\nWhat\u2019s new about Trump\u2019s recently announced Cuba policy? Can people still travel to the country?\n\nWell, for starters, none of Trump\u2019s reforms take effect immediately. (They could take up to 90 days.)\n\nTrump\u2019s primary objective is to keep money out of the hands of Cuba\u2019s military and intelligence services.\n\nThe new rules include prohibitions on Americans spending money on businesses controlled by the military, which has a wide reach in the Cuban economy. This is likely to affect pending hotel projects with Cuban companies that have ties to the military.\n\nTrump also will reimpose the requirement that \"people-to-people\" travelers can only come to Cuba with heavily regulated tour groups. The ability of Americans to travel freely on vacation to the country will be scrapped.\n\n\u201cAmerica is prepared to outstretch its hand and work with the people of Cuba, but we will not, we will not empower their oppressors,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who helped craft the new regulations, said at Friday\u2019s event with Trump. (Rubio and many Republican members of Congress had assailed Obama\u2019s directive with Cuba, saying Cuba\u2019s Communist government and military were benefiting.)\n\nWhat remains in place from Obama\u2019s policy?\n\nTrump will not close the U.S. Embassy in Havana, and commercial flights and cruise ships will still be allowed.\n\nMoreover, it appears there\u2019s a willingness to keep in place Obama\u2019s efforts to communicate with Cuba.\n\nIn a memo from the Trump administration, it notes \u201cany further improvements in the United States-Cuba relationship will depend entirely on the Cuban government\u2019s willingness to improve the lives of the Cuban people,\u201d and also mandates regular reporting of progress toward this objective.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the response to Trump\u2019s efforts?\n\nRepublicans like Rubio, who is Cuban and a native of South Florida, lauded the effort.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) also lauded Trump for keeping a campaign promise.\n\n\u201cYou have not betrayed us. You kept your promise; you stand in solidarity with the Cuban people and freedom-loving people everywhere; and you are putting American values and U.S. national security interests first,\u201d he said.\n\nBut groups both here in the United States and the Cuban government expressed some reservations.\n\nIn a statement, Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the new rules limit the \u201cpossibility for positive change on the island and risk ceding growth opportunities to other countries that, frankly, may not share America\u2019s interest in a free and democratic Cuba that respects human rights.\u201d\n\nResponding to Trump\u2019s announcement, the Cuban government said in a statement that American attempts to fundamentally change the island were unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe statement said a \u201cstrategy aimed at changing the political, economic and social system in Cuba, whether it seeks to achieve it through pressures and impositions, or by employing more subtle methods, will be doomed to failure.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-17", "authors": "Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
