But the underlying legal claims against it don't change that much,\" said Cox.\n\nCox said his group and others will \"absolutely\" be able to sue over the new order.\n\n\"What is more challenging is finding folks who clearly have standing\" to sue, he said.\n\nThat's because the new order exempts people with green cards from the ban, doesn't state a preference for refugees who are religious minorities and will not go into effect immediately, leaving fewer chances for the chaos over admission and detention of visa holders at U.S. airports that came with the previous order.\n\nStill, Cox said, it's \"time to go to court\" over the new order.\n\nThe Darweesh case was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., on behalf of two Iraqis who had been approved for resettlement in the U.S. but were detained at John F. Kennedy airport because of the first travel ban. Iraqis are not included in the new executive order.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
