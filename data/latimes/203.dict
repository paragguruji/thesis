The court of appeals upheld that order Thursday night.\n\nThe courts have planned to hold further hearings on whether to issue a permanent injunction. Trump's new orders, which are expected to be more narrowly focused, could make the existing cases moot, however.\n\nThe current order, which Trump issued on Jan. 27, made several changes in U.S. immigration policy. It banned entry by citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, It also temporarily banned all refugee entries into the U.S. and indefinitely suspended the admission of Syrian refugees. And it created a preference for refugees who are members of persecuted religious minorities.\n\nThe administration now seems likely to rescind that order and issue one or more new ones that would suspend refugee admissions and limit new visas from a specific list of countries, according to an administration official familiar with the internal deliberations.\n\nThe new orders would allow everyone who already holds a visa or refugee status to keep it. Doing that would eliminate the bulk of the legal flaws that courts have focused on so far.\n\n\u201cThe team is reviewing options\" to present to the president. \"But ultimately it's all short term anyway because we are going to prevail on the merits of the case,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said.\n\n3:10 p.m.: This story was updated with President Trump's comment on Air Force One and more details of the administration's plans.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Michael A.
