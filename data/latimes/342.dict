Gen. Xavier Becerra announced the friend-of-the-court brief after a federal judge put a nationwide hold on the immigration moratorium and the case was appealed by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThe state of California is today on the record opposing the Trump administration\u2019s executive order banning travel for principally individuals of Muslim origin and faith,\u201d Becerra said at a press conference in Fresno on Monday.\n\nCalifornia was joined in filing the brief by Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and the District of Columbia.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the nearly 40 million people of California, I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with [other] attorneys general ... to preserve the suspension of the Trump Administration's travel ban,\" Becerra said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Administration's reckless dismissal of the Constitution threatens to rip apart California families, risks their economic well-being and defies centuries of our American tradition,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe brief, co-written by Becerra's office and its counterparts in New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, argues that Trump\u2019s order harms the state.\n\n\u201cIf this court were to grant a stay, it would resurrect the chaos experienced in our airports beginning on the weekend of January 28 and 29, and cause harm to the States\u2014including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents,\u201d said the 23-page brief.\n\nThe attorney general said medical school programs would \"risk being without a sufficient number of medical residents to meet staffing needs.\"\n\nIn addition, Becerra said \u201cthe process of admitting students to state colleges and universities would be disrupted\u201d as more than 2,000 students would be affected.\n\n\u201cWe in California will continue to coordinate with like-minded states in a concerted effort to fight the travel ban that denies the rights of law-abiding people to travel freely here and abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to receive written arguments from both sides today and may rule within a week.\n\nThe panel will rule on whether an emergency stay against Trump's orders should remain in place until the constitutional issues are decided.\n\nThe federal judge who issued the restraining order decided that the states that challenged the immigration moratorium would suffer immediate and irreparable harm in employment, business, education, familial relations and freedom to travel.\n\nUpdated at 3:41 pm to include Becerra comment from Fresno press conference.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Patrick McGreevy", "type": "article"}
