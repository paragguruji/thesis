Kelly told the House Homeland Security Committee in his first appearance before Congress since Trump temporarily halted refugees and barred entry for people to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nLooking back, Kelly added, \"I should have delayed it just a bit\" to inform those directly affected by the order as well as members of Congress.\n\nBut the writing of the order and planning for its rollout was limited chiefly to a handful of senior White House advisors and agency lawyers, and Kelly found himself in the awkward position of defending the execution of a directive he didn\u2019t see until the week it was issued and wasn\u2019t told was coming until the day before it was signed.\n\n\"The thinking was to get it out quick so that people trying to come here to harm us could not take advantage of a period of time to jump on an airplane,\" he said.\n\nThe White House has been heavily criticized not only for the chaos at airports that ensued after the ban was implemented but also because lawmakers and policy experts were left out of crafting the directive.\n\nLawmakers of both parties condemned the White House over the temporary ban's implementation.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
