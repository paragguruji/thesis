Her one-way trip from New York, where she lives separately from her husband so their son can finish the school year, cost taxpayers more than $110,000.\n\nNobody questions that the safety of the president and his family is of vital national interest, or that the costs of first family travel and protection have soared in the age of terrorism.\n\nBut a unique set of circumstances has made the current presidential family the most expensive in history. There is no standard methodology to tally travel and protection costs, but based on publicly available information reviewed by The Times, the total for Trump\u2019s first 100 days was at least $30 million. By comparison, the conservative think tank Judicial Watch found that costs for President Obama and his much smaller family averaged $12 million a year.\n\nIn the federal budget compromise reached last week, Congress allocated the Secret Service an additional $13 million to cover unanticipated overtime for its agents. It also set aside an extra $61 million to reimburse New York and Palm Beach for some of their expenses incurred since the election to protect the first family.\n\n\u201cAlthough the federal government does not otherwise reimburse costs of state or local law enforcement for activities in support of the United States Secret Service protection mission, these funds are being provided in recognition of the extraordinary costs borne by a small number of jurisdictions in which a residence of the president is located,\u201d the budget bill stated.\n\nThe jump in costs is largely due to the fact that Trump has used three separate residences \u2014 the White House, Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago. Over the weekend he added a fourth: the Bedminster, N.J., golf club where the family has traditionally spent summer weekends.\n\nIn addition to protecting the president and first lady, the Secret Service guards five children, their three spouses and eight grandchildren \u2014 16 people in all. Since the election, Secret Service agents have accompanied the president\u2019s two adult sons on business trips to Dubai, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Canada, Ireland and Scotland. Each \u201cprotectee\u201d \u2014 as they are called by the Secret Service \u2014 gets his or her own security detail even when traveling together.\n\nWhen Melania, Barron and the president\u2019s younger daughter, Tiffany, recently visited Chelsea Piers, a sporting complex in Manhattan, 14 Secret Service vehicles waited outside.\n\nAnd when Donald Trump Jr., wife Vanessa and their five children; Ivanka Trump and her three children; and Eric Trump, wife Lara and their two beagles went to Aspen, Colo., for spring break, they were accompanied by up to 100 Secret Service agents. Ski rentals for agents cost taxpayers $12,208, according to a government invoice uncovered by NBC News.\n\nThe most expensive property to protect is Trump Tower, the 58-story skyscraper in midtown Manhattan where Melania and Barron live in a penthouse and Donald Jr. and Eric have their offices.\n\nThe New York Police Department wrote in a letter to Congress that it was spending $127,000 to $146,000 a day to secure the building, in addition to the $4.5 million that the Fire Department expects to spend this year on security there. The costs are expected to decline after Melania moves to Washington this summer.\n\nJonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who had been assigned to former First lady Michelle Obama, says the costs are justified because the security of the first lady has a direct bearing on the president\u2019s ability to function.\n\nEven so, Wackrow said: \u201cIt\u2019s an astronomical expense. You have to set up a massive security structure for the first lady to operate outside of Washington with everything that support the detail, from cars to communications.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew York is a very complicated environment,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re working in Billings, Mont.\u201d\n\nSusan Walsh / Associated Press President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrive at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., in February.

(Susan Walsh / Associated Press)\n\nOn a weekday afternoon, cool and drizzling with nary a protester in sight \u2014 what should pass as a quiet day at Trump Tower \u2014 the building is a veritable fortress girded by at least 30 uniformed NYPD officers and at least that many Secret Service agents in bulletproof vests inspecting bags or guarding the elevators and doors.\n\nThere also is a fleet of two dozen armored SUVs, mobile police stations, police cars and other vehicles, including a strategically placed garbage truck that blocks the private garage through which members of the Trump family enter and leave the building. More security forces are tucked away in the surrounding high-rises.\n\nMar-a-Lago is another big expense. Palm Beach County says its overtime runs $60,000 a day when Trump is visiting, and was $250,000 for the weekend when Chinese President Xi Jinping joined him. The county is considering turning the Mar-a-Lago resort into a special taxing district to recoup the money being spent on Trump.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has spent seven weekends at the resort, each trip costing at least $1 million, with some estimates running up to $3.6 million. The biggest chunk of that is the $142,000 an hour it costs to fly Air Force One.\n\nMelania Trump has flown separately on five occasions either to or from Palm Beach, according to the Palm Beach Post. Public accounts of her appearances show she has also made at least eight round-trip flights to Washington, D.C., since the inauguration. The Air Force said that it could not immediately provide her flight records but that each hour of flying on the Boeing C-32 \u2014 the largest and most expensive of the three planes she uses \u2014 costs $38,922.\n\n\u201cIt is all about security,\u201d Wackrow said. \u201cThe first lady needs to be in constant communication with the president and she has no ability to do that on a nonmilitary aircraft.\u201d\n\nMore controversial is the foreign travel of Donald Jr. and Eric, who make frequent splashy trips to Trump-branded properties.\n\n\u201cYou have people with not only heavy travel schedules, but heavy business schedules with enormous public profiles,\u201d said Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who is now active in Republican politics in Florida. \u201cDonald Trump Jr. is like a brand in and of itself.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-08", "authors": "Barbara Demick", "type": "article"}
