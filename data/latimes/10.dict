British authorities said they were treating the incident as a terrorist act.\n\nTrump went further than British officials and said the perpetrators were \"in the sights\" of Scotland Yard investigators before the attack. There is no public evidence to support this claim.\n\nIn what seemed to be a response to Trump's tweet, London Metropolitan Police said in a statement, \"any speculation is extremely unhelpful at this time.\"\n\nLater Friday morning Trump called the London attack \"a terrible thing,\" while he was in the Rose Garden watching an 11-year-old boy from Falls Church, Va., mow the White House lawn.\n\n\u201cIt keeps going and going, and we have to be very smart and we have to be very, very tough\u2014perhaps we\u2019re not nearly tough enough,\u201d he said in response to a question from a reporter.\n\nTrump said he had been briefed on the London attack, and said he had been told about \"new risks of things happening.\"\n\nTrump has a chance to widen the travel ban later this month.\n\nThe 90-day ban is set to expire on Sept. 24, and Department of Homeland Security officials are considering whether to expand the ban to other countries, keep it the same, or take countries off the list.\n\nTrump administration officials are also reviewing what new vetting procedures for travelers should be put into place, including requiring visa applicants from some countries to submit to checks of their social media accounts. Trump has called similar procedures \"extreme vetting.\"\n\nCurrently, foreign nationals are banned from six countries \u2014 Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. Iraq was dropped from the banned countries list in March in exchange for accepting Iraqi nationals being deported from the U.S.\n\nRefugees without close ties to the U.S. are also barred entry until Oct. 24 under the ban.\n\nTrump administration officials issued a revised travel ban in March that was designed to resolve the legal problems that had led to Trump's original order being blocked in January. The Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge next month of the revised ban.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-01", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
