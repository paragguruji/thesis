But Farhadi wasn\u2019t present to accept the Oscar.\n\nThe director, who hails from Iran, boycotted the ceremony in protest of the travel ban implemented by President Trump in late January targeting travelers from seven countries, including Iran.\n\nAnousheh Ansari, the first Iranian in space, accepted the award for Farhadi and read a short statement from the director.\n\n\u201cMy absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of six other nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.,\u201d Farhadi\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe audience inside the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood greeted the statement with enthusiastic applause.\n\n\u201cFilmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions,\u201d Ansari continued. \u201cThey create empathy between us and others. An empathy which we need today more than ever.\u201d\n\nIn most years, the foreign-language film category at the Oscars can be a sleepy one \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s obligatory nod to the large body of cinematic work produced globally. The most notable foreign-language Oscar moments in recent years include Roberto Benigni\u2019s dramatic traipse to the stage after winning the award for \u201cLife Is Beautiful,\u201d and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s deliriously incomprehensible acceptance speech for \u201cAll About My Mother\u201d in 2000.\n\nBut this year, the category became a fraught locus of politics after the implementation of Trump\u2019s travel ban. Farhadi announced that he would not attend the awards ceremony \u2014 even if he were granted an exemption from the ban.\n\nIn a statement, he condemned \u201cthe unjust conditions forced upon some of my compatriots and the citizens of the other six countries trying to legally enter the United States of America.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the five directors nominated in the foreign-language film category \u2014 Denmark\u2019s Martin Zandvliet (\u201cLand of Mine\u201d), Sweden\u2019s Hannes Holm (\u201cA Man Called Ove\u201d), Germany\u2019s Maren Ade (\u201cToni Erdmann\u201d) and Australia\u2019s Martin Butler and Bentley Dean (\u201cTanna\u201d) \u2014 issued a joint statement that expressed their \u201cunanimous and emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S.\u201d and dedicated the award to all the \u201cpeople, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding.\u201d\n\nRegardless of who wins the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, \u201cwe refuse to think in terms of borders,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe there is no best country, best gender, best religion or best color.\u201d\n\nThough the travel ban was later halted by a federal judge, Farhadi nonetheless stood by his decision to boycott the ceremony. He sent two prominent Iranian Americans in his place: Ansari and Firouz Naderi, a former NASA director for solar system exploration.\n\nFarhadi remained in Tehran but remained highly visible.\n\nHe made a remote video appearance in London via video link just hours before the Oscars ceremony at an outdoor screening of \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d organized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan and filmmaker Mike Leigh. The screening, a gesture of solidarity with the Iranian director, drew 10,000 people.\n\nIn the message delivered to the crowd, Farhadi said: \u201cI hope this movement will continue and spread, for it has within itself the power to stand up to fascism, be victorious in the face of extremism and say no to oppressive political powers everywhere.\u201d\n\nBackstage at the Oscars on Sunday, Naderi was asked why he thought Farhadi had chosen Ansari and him to accept the Oscar.\n\n\"She's an astronaut. I work for NASA. If you go away from the Earth and look back, you don\u2019t see any of the borders,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cI think he chose the both of us to say 'come together.' \"\n\nContributing to this report was Times staff writer Tre\u2019vell Anderson.\n\nDaniel Leal-Olivas / AFP / Getty Images Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi in a videotaped message during a public screening of \"The Salesman\" in Trafalgar Square in London.
