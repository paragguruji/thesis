He told senators as recently as two weeks ago that they should revive the 2013 proposal that died in the House.\n\nSuch a move would be a dramatic about-face from the actions he has taken so far, chiefly signing orders last month that subject to deportation virtually all of the 11 million people in the U.S.\n\nNonetheless, Trump said Tuesday during a lunch with television anchors that the time may be right for immigration reform if both sides compromise, according to PBS NewsHour correspondent John Yang and others present.\n\nTrump believes Congress may be in a position to navigate one of the thorniest policy thickets after two failures to pass a bill in the last decade, including the 2013 effort.\n\n\u201cThe president has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he\u2019s made clear that he\u2019s open to having conversations about that moving forward,\u201d Sarah H. Sanders, White House deputy press secretary, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nShe wouldn't say whether Trump will include a call for immigration reform in his address to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cRight now, his primary focus, as he has made clear over and over again, is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities have not changed,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nDuring his first week in office, Trump wiped away restrictions on immigration officers, opening the door to deportations for millions of immigrants in the country illegally.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
