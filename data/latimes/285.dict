I'm Davan Maharaj, editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nThe Early Warnings to Trump About Flynn\n\nThe warnings were there, according to former government officials: In November, President Obama cautioned Donald Trump against picking Michael Flynn as national security advisor. In January, acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates told White House lawyers that Flynn \u201ccould be blackmailed\u201d by Moscow, may have violated criminal statutes and had misled Vice President Pence about his dealings with Russian officials. But the rest, as they say, is history. After the testimony of Yates and former Director of National Security James Clapper before the Senate on Monday, Trump responded with a tweet storm \u2014 and an update of his Twitter banner to drive home the point: \u201cDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows \u2014 there is \u2018no evidence\u2019 of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Travel Ban Gets Its Day in Court (Again)\n\nDuring her testimony, Yates also defended her decision not to defend Trump\u2019s travel ban, getting into a particularly pointed exchange with Sen. Ted Cruz. Meanwhile, judges in the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments over Trump\u2019s revised executive order. For them, it comes down to whether the order is based on national security or religious discrimination. Again, Trump\u2019s own campaign language came back to haunt the discussion.\n\nMore Politics\n\n-- The Trump administration will not reappoint half the expert members of a board that advises the Environmental Protection Agency on the integrity of its science.\n\n-- More and more former political operatives are choosing Silicon Valley over K Street and Wall Street as their destination of choice.\n\nVideo: Ted Cruz Never Slammed Those \u2018Houston Values\u2019\n\nDeep in the heart of Texas, Houston has become a city of cowboys and Indians and Ethiopians and immigrants from all points in between. By one measure, it has become the most racially and ethnically diverse major metropolis in the country, surpassing New York in 2010. Doesn\u2019t fit the Texas stereotype, does it? Now, with Texas\u2019 governor having signed a bill to punish so-called sanctuary cities, Houston could be on the front lines in the immigration battle.\n\nGary Coronado / Los Angeles Times The Margaret Long Wisdom High School soccer team in Houston hails from Central America, Mexico, Africa and beyond.

The system\u2019s topmost echelon faces questions about its accounting and credibility, and Berkeley has found itself in the center of a free speech free-for-all. At the same time, discontent among many UC students of color has been growing. Several incidents have led them to believe that administrators and some fellow students slight them, and in recent days they have scored a big student body electoral victory at UCLA and housing concessions at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nMUST-WATCH VIDEO\n\n-- Three key minutes of Sally Yates\u2019 testimony before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee.\n\n-- If Amanda Peet could star in \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d who would her costar be?\n\n-- Take a drive on scenic Highway 33 in the 610-horsepower Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\n-- The Los Angeles Police Department paid nearly $81 million in legal settlements last year, a sharp increase as the city closed the books on several high-profile and costly cases.\n\n-- The furor over Joe Bray-Ali\u2019s online comments has provided a lift to L.A.
