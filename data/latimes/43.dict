{"title": "Trump orders new and narrower travel ban that goes into effect in 10 days", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-travel-ban-20170306-story.html", "text": "President Trump ordered that entry to the U.S. be suspended for residents from six Muslim-majority countries and blocked refugees from around the world Monday, retooling the executive order that stoked chaos at airports and drew international condemnation and a rebuke in the courts.\n\nTrump removed Iraqis from the list of travelers who were temporarily banned, clarified that holders of visas and green cards can come to the U.S. and took other steps aimed at ensuring the order holds up in court.\n\nThough far narrower than what Trump promised on the campaign trail, the order had its roots in his December 2015 pledge to ban all Muslims from entering the country. And while temporary, the order lays the foundation for further restrictions on travel and asylum as Trump opens another front in his effort to tighten the nation\u2019s borders.\n\nTrump has long argued that the immigration system is failing to protect the nation from the threat of terrorism and that previous leaders were too timid to put American interests ahead of global opinion.\n\n\u201cLike every nation, the United States has a right to control who enters our country and to keep out those who would do us harm,\u201d Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said during an announcement alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly.\n\nOpponents argued that even if Trump is not banning all Muslims, his narrower measure still amounts to religious profiling, and sends a message that undermines American values and helps terrorist organizations recruit. They say Trump\u2019s travel suspension and refugee ban are too broad and arbitrary to enhance safety, leaving out, for example, the countries that spawned the Sept. 11 attackers.\n\n\u201cA watered-down ban is still a ban,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cDespite the administration\u2019s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more. It is mean-spirited and un-American. It must be repealed.\u201d\n\nRead President Trump's new executive order on travel and refugees \u00bb\n\nThe ban, which takes effect March 16, halts travel for 90 days for residents of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The refugee suspension will last 120 days.\n\nIraq, whose citizens and nationals had been on the earlier list of banned travelers, was removed after officials there agreed to accept all Iraqis being deported from the U.S.\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly called the war in Iraq a disaster, language in the revised order praises the country\u2019s \u201cdemocratically elected government\u201d for close cooperation in fighting Islamic State terrorists and vetting travelers.\n\nTrump had faced criticism from military leaders for initially banning Iraqis who put their lives at risk to help U.S. troops. The Iraqi government had also threatened retaliation that could have blocked U.S. aid workers, journalists and contractors from working in the country.\n\nThe new ban also puts a 120-day limit on what had been an indefinite suspension on accepting refugees from Syria and removes language intended to help Christian refugees and other religious minorities facing persecution in winning asylum.\n\nThose were among several changes to the order designed to insulate it from court challenges; the first one was blocked only days after it was issued. The new order also leaves time for agencies to implement it in hopes of alleviating the confusion that accompanied the original order, which was issued only a week after Trump took office and with little consultation from top agency officials.\n\n\"There should be no surprises \u2014 whether it's in the media or on Capitol Hill,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nThe new ban clarifies that permanent residents, dual citizens and those holding valid visas of all kinds \u2014 including for study, travel and work \u2014 will be allowed to enter the country or remain here, and it restores visas for those who had them revoked after the first travel ban was imposed. The order will give the State Department room for case-by-case exceptions.\n\nTrump had defended the hasty manner in which the original order was crafted as necessary for security, claiming bad actors would try to enter the country if there was any delay in stopping them. Yet the new order not only took weeks to release, but it also provides time between Monday\u2019s signing and next week\u2019s effective date.\n\nMany in Trump\u2019s circle are eager to renew debate over the ban, which has been popular among Trump\u2019s supporters, after several days of questions about the White House\u2019s ties to Russia and a weekend in which Trump made unsubstantiated charges that President Obama was tapping his phones during the presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important week in this White House, where the president is going to continue to act on, along with the Congress, major pieces of his legislative and executive agenda,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, senior White House counselor, said on Fox News' \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nTrump signed the order privately Monday morning.\n\nSeveral Republican leaders in Congress praised the measure, though some emphasized its limited scope. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called the travel ban \u201cjust a short pause in accepting immigrants from these countries\u201d while officials take \u201ca harder look at people coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terrorist networks.\u201d\n\nTrump had vowed to keep fighting for the original order, tweeting \u201csee you in court\u201d after a pair of legal defeats that suspended enforcement of the ban, in part because it was seen as discriminatory toward Muslims.\n\nLanguage in the new ban asserts that the original order was \u201cnot motivated by animus toward any religion,\u201d pointing out that Muslims would have also qualified as persecuted religious minorities in some countries.\n\nDespite the tough talk, the new travel ban ends the court fight on the old one, formally rescinding the original order next week, a step the administration\u2019s lawyers had promised in court documents.\n\nTrump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the court fight was dropped to avoid prolonged litigation \u201cthat would have left the country exposed.\"\n\nStill, the new order will leave many of the former goals intact, while planting the seeds for further limits.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Noah Bierman , Michael A.
