The administration has appealed the 4th Circuit decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit, following a different rationale, said it wasn\u2019t necessary to reach the constitutional question because Trump\u2019s order violated the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress.\n\nThat reasoning could be more palatable to the Supreme Court than the sweeping constitutional ruling by the 4th Circuit, scholars said.\n\nThe panel of three judges appointed by President Clinton faulted the travel order on two grounds. The court said that it failed to justify why a ban was needed and that it restricted entry based on nationality.\n\nIn short, the order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries ... would be detrimental. \u2014 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nBy suspending entry of more than 180 million foreigners and the admission of refugees, Trump exceeded the authority granted to him by Congress, the court said.\n\nThe administration argued the ban was necessary to study whether security measures were adequate for vetting travelers from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya.\n\nThe 9th Circuit, though, said the order contained no finding that current procedures were inadequate, failed to tie the targeted nationalities to terrorist groups or \u201cprovide any link between an individual\u2019s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, the order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d the panel said.\n\nThe court agreed with the government that federal law gives presidents broad powers over the entry of people from other countries and over actions to protect the American public.\n\n\u201cBut immigration, even for the president, is not a one-person show,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to take up the 4th Circuit decision.\n\nBecause the 9th Circuit reached the same result but for different reasons, the Supreme Court also would have to consider Monday\u2019s decision if it reviews Trump\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is going to have to take both of these cases,\u201d UC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky said.\n\nThe 9th Circuit decision \u201cgives the Supreme Court two separate bases for blocking the travel ban, and it could only uphold the travel ban if it rejects both,\u201d the constitutional law professor said.\n\nThe decision by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard Paez largely leaves in place a nationwide injunction issued by a federal judge in Hawaii in response to a lawsuit by the state and a Honolulu-based imam.\n\nThe 9th Circuit narrowed the injunction a bit to allow for internal studies of security measures. The 4th Circuit also allowed that portion of the order to take effect.\n\nSome legal scholars said that narrowing of the injunctions would make the cases moot within a matter of months because the Trump administration would have the 90 days it said it needed to review vetting procedures.\n\n\u201cSo now that that consultation can happen, the 90-day travel ban will be mooted out no later than a few months from now \u2014 before October, when the case could be argued\u201d in the Supreme Court, said Margo Schlanger, a University of Michigan law professor and former civil rights official in the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security.\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and law professor at Cornell University, said the Supreme Court might find it easier to reject the travel ban based on a violation of existing law rather than constitutional grounds.\n\n\u201cIt is always hard to win an immigration case on constitutional grounds in the Supreme Court because immigration touches on foreign relations and national sovereignty issues,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople outside the United States also generally don\u2019t have U.S. constitutional rights, he said.\n\nThe combination of the two rulings \u201cprovides a one-two punch against the executive order that will make it harder for the administration to win at the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nThe high court is likely to decide this month whether it will review the travel ban.\n\nThe 9th Circuit cited tweets from Trump, including one after a terrorist attack in London this month in which he said that \u201cwe need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries\u201d \u2014 not nationalities.\n\nThe judges also cited White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said this month that Trump's tweets are \"considered official statements by the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAtty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said the administration would continue to press for Supreme Court review.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump knows that the country he has been elected to lead is threatened daily by terrorists who believe in a radical ideology, and that there are active plots to infiltrate the U.S. immigration system \u2014 just as occurred prior to 9/11,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision stemmed from an appeal of a decision by Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, who issued a preliminary injunction after concluding that anti-Muslim sentiment motivated the ban.\n\nThe state of Hawaii and Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii, argued that Trump\u2019s order stigmatized Muslims and would hurt tourism and the recruitment of university students and faculty.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration countered that presidents have wide authority over matters of immigration and national security and should not be second-guessed by unelected federal judges.\n\nA different 9th Circuit panel rejected an earlier and broader travel ban in February, prompting the administration to revise it.\n\nMost of the groups that weighed in on the case urged the court to retain the injunction.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-30", "authors": "Maura Dolan, Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
