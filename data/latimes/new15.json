The state of Hawaii has asked a judge who previously ruled against the ban to say whether the administration is violating the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions. The judge could issue his decision next week.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate rages with the ban in place for the first time since a chaotic rollout in January.\n\nPresident Trump signs the original travel ban executive order on Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP)\n\nRefugees, as well as nationals of six countries, are not welcome\n\nThe ban covers Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The administration has said the nations have ties to terrorism, and that it needs 90 days to evaluate security vetting procedures to protect Americans.\n\nIn addition, refugees from any country are barred for four months.\n\nAn original version of the travel ban \u2014 signed by Trump on Jan. 27 and later struck down in federal courts \u2014 included Iraq on the list of countries. The order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. and gave preference to refugees who were religious minorities facing persecution.\n\nThe state of Hawaii and immigrant groups that won lower court injunctions against the travel ban have said the administration is violating the Constitution by targeting those six countries. Most residents of the nations are Muslims, and challengers to the ban say the president has focused on them as part of his campaign promise to suspend all Muslim immigration.\n\nTwo legal challenges to the ban, originating in Hawaii and Maryland, will be heard by the Supreme Court in the fall.\n\nImmigration attorneys set up a table at Los Angeles International Airport as the new travel ban went into effect on Thursday. (Stephen Carr / AP)\n\nPeople with close ties get into U.S. But what\u2019s a close tie?\n\nWhen it allowed a limited version of the travel ban to proceed, Supreme Court justices said the government could not apply it to people who had well-established connections to the U.S.\n\nThe court listed employment, university admission and invitations to lecture \u2014 such as at a college \u2014 among those connections.\n\nOn Thursday, the departments of State and Homeland Security said people with green cards and visas that were valid before the ban went into effect won\u2019t be affected.\n\nThe same goes for people granted asylum, and those who could claim dual nationality with another country not on the travel ban list. Diplomats, visitors to the United Nations, NATO officials and certain foreign government representatives are also among the exceptions.\n\nSeveral of those categories were added to Trump\u2019s second executive order on travel that was signed in March after the first one saw court setbacks.\n\nA point of contention remains: How to define who has well-established ties to the U.S.\n\nThe administration is now facing criticism from immigrant advocates for its list, released late Thursday, detailing what kinds of family members are \u201cclose\u201d enough to escape the travel ban.\n\nSpouses, parents, in-laws and siblings are considered close; grandparents and other relations are not.\n\nInitially, fiances were subject to the ban. After civil rights groups complained, Trump administration officials added fiances to the close-family list right before the ban went into effect.\n\nHow the Trump administration defines \u201cclose\u201d family \u201cClose\u201d family that can go around the travel ban A parent, parents-in-law, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, fianc\u00e9(e), son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling and half-sibling\n\nStep relationships are included Family that cannot bypass the travel ban Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers- and sisters-in-law\n\nOther extended family members\n\nTravelers make their way up the arrival ramp at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday. (Jae C. Hong / AP)\n\nThe situation for refugees is unclear\n\nWhile the Supreme Court said the exemptions that apply to travelers from the six countries also must apply to refugees, it didn\u2019t provide clear details on how refugees could prove a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the U.S.\n\nResettlement organizations argue that the relationships these groups have with refugees they are assisting should count. The U.S. government disagrees.\n\n\u201cThat a resettlement agency in the United States has provided a formal assurance for refugees seeking admission is not sufficient, in and of itself,\u201d a senior administration official said in a briefing before the ban went into effect.\n\nThe Department of State has said refugees who arrive in the country through July 6 will be admitted whether they can claim a connection to the U.S. or not. That\u2019s the date that the department expects a 50,000 cap on refugees to be reached for the fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. The cap is listed in Trump\u2019s executive order on the ban.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, the department said 49,009 refugees had come to the country this fiscal year. Officials said they would give instructions later on what to do with refugees planning to arrive after July 6. The Supreme Court\u2019s order said the cap can be exceeded for refugees who claim a legitimate U.S. relationship.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/879527520957325314\n\nHow many people does this affect?\n\nLawyers who have sued the president said the travel ban, as it currently stands, will block significantly fewer people than previous attempts at a ban.\n\n\u201cMost non-citizens who come to this country and are applying for a visa have a connection to the U.S.,\u201d said Justin Cox, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center who is part of a team representing refugee and immigrant groups fighting the ban in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, there are more than 200 million people in the world who couldn\u2019t get in because these six countries have a population of about 180 million and there are about 65 million refugees,\u201d he said.\n\nCox said the government had too narrowly applied the court\u2019s instructions on who should be exempted from the travel restrictions. He said government was \u201cessentially shutting down\u201d refugee resettlement.\n\nBut Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, said the Trump administration was on solid ground.\n\n\u201cI probably would have also included grandparents, for no other reason than they tug at sentimental heart strings. But when administering the immigration laws, the government often draws lines that are harsh and arbitrary,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment officials said they have no estimate of how many people the travel ban will block. The six nations represent a sliver of international travel to the country. The U.S. has no embassy or limited consular services in many of them.\n\nData from 2015 show that there were 49,412 tourist and business visits to the U.S. by citizens of the six countries. Employment and student visas that year accounted for 13,000 visits.\n\nGreen cards, which make someone a legal permanent resident, were given that year to 31,258 people from the nations. Not all those people would be new immigrants. Some people secure green cards after living in the U.S. a long time.\n\nAccording to Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, there are about 26,000 refugees who have \u201cgone through extensive vetting\u201d and are approved by the U.S. government for relocation. The vast majority of those do not have tickets booked to travel before the July 6 deadline. A large portion have no family ties in the U.S.\n\nSupport our journalism Already a subscriber?
