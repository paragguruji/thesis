We've had Tunisians and Syrians too, all flying from Germany on Lufthansa,\" said Kerry Doyle, an attorney with the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. who was posted at the airport.\n\nMany visa holders had changed their plans and fly to Massachusetts even though it wasn't their originally intended port of entry because of an earlier Boston federal judge's temporary order against Trump's ban that was being applied locally when the national order came down from Seattle.\n\n\"It's a whole different feeling at the airport than last week,\" said Doyle.\n\nAbed Ayoub, policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said he had been in touch with lawyers for immigrants headed toward several other U.S. airports.\n\n\"We've heard a lot of good news for a change. A number of individuals we're working with have been permitted to board flights to the U.S. They're nationals from Iran, Libya, Iraq and Sudan flying to Boston, New York and Virginia,\" said Ayoub.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
