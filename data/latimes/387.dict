There were 12 perpetrators.\n\nAll were either Americans citizens or in the country legally. Here's where they were born:\n\nUnited States: 7\n\nRussia: 1\n\nKyrgyzstan: 1\n\nEgypt: 1\n\nKuwait: 1\n\nPakistan: 1\n\nOne man was responsible for 49 of the 94 total deaths in those attacks: Omar Mateen, who gunned down patrons at an Orlando, Fla., night club last June. He was born in New York to Afghan parents.\n\nThe second biggest death toll came in December 2015, when Tashfeen Malik, a Pakistani woman, and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, who was born in the United States, killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
