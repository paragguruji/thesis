Now they're furious over Trump's travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iraq-trump-20170130-story.html", "text": "At Caf\u00e9 Baghdad, a gathering spot in Beirut for many Iraqis and Syrians who fled violence in their countries, the conversation Monday was of little but the U.S. travel ban.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fault of the families and children here?\u201d said 50-year-old Mounir Gerges, whose voice rose in indignation as he watched a group of his friends play dominoes.\n\nLike other cafe patrons, he feared that more countries would adopt the same hard line as the Trump administration. A former government employee in Iraq, Gerges worried that his application to join his family in Australia would be delayed.\n\n\u201cThe U.N. is doing nothing for us about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years with them going slow, and now this.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which blocks travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 has caused anger and resentment across the Muslim world, but nobody has felt it so sharply as Iraqis.\n\nTheir nation\u2019s army has fought side-by-side with the Americans on the war against Islamist extremism. A major battle is underway right now: American forces are backing Iraqi and Kurdish fighters as they seek to drive Islamic State militants from Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul.\n\n\u201cIraq is on the front line of the war on terrorism,\u201d the parliament\u2019s foreign committee said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt is unfair that the Iraqis are treated in this way.\u201d\n\nIn comments directed at the Trump administration, Muqtada Sadr, a powerful Shiite cleric and political leader, said on his website, \u201cIt would be arrogance for you to enter freely Iraq and other countries while barring to them the entrance to your country ... and therefore you should get your nationals out.\u201d\n\nParliament was pressuring the Iraqi government to retaliate with measures that would do just that.\n\n\u201cWhy is it on us Iraqis?\u201d said Meshan Jboori, a lawmaker from a Sunni faction. \u201cAnd no Iraqi has ever conducted any terrorist attack in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs for those Americans who are here, I think they should leave,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to back down, then they should leave, yes, even the fighters. I\u2019m sure Russia will be willing to take their place and give us the support we need to defeat terrorism.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, which blocks entry of all Iraqi citizens for 90 days, also includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also keeps out all refugees for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. Trump said it was aimed at keeping terrorists out of the country while giving the government time to strengthen its vetting procedures.\n\nIn Washington, the order left Trump\u2019s most senior Cabinet members struggling to contain the fallout. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, who began work the day the order came down, was reportedly not consulted in advance about the directive.\n\nThe Pentagon, which has 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, was seeking to shield Iraqi citizens who have worked with the U.S. military from the travel ban, compiling a list of Iraqis it will recommend for exemption.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Douglas A. Silliman, who took up his post less than five months ago, was meeting with Iraqi lawmakers to try to stave off a vote for Iraq to respond in kind to the U.S. restrictions.\n\nThousands of American contractors work in Iraq. Business deals, including arms sales and energy, run into the billions of dollars. U.S. troops and diplomats have for years depended on Iraqis working alongside them, sometimes in life-or-death situations. There is close intelligence cooperation between the two countries.\n\nDiplomatically, Iraq has so far been treading carefully. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement asking the new U.S. administration to \u201creconsider this wrong decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe affirm Iraq\u2019s desire to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries,\u201d it said.\n\nBut officials and ordinary citizens alike said they found it baffling to be on a list that also included the failing or failed states of Libya and Yemen and avowed U.S. rival Iran.\n\nAmong those caught by surprise was Lukman Faily, a former ambassador to Washington, who said he would not be able to travel to the United States for upcoming conferences. He told CNN that Iraqis were \u201castonished\u201d by the travel ban, considering it a deep affront to national pride.\n\nParticularly galling to some was the notion that Iraqis entering the United States posed a terrorist threat, in light of the fact that few countries have been harder hit by terrorism. Suicide bombings and other attacks have killed and maimed thousands in Iraq over the last decade.\n\nCompounding the resentment, Trump rattled Iraq with repeated assertions that the United States should have \u201ctaken the oil\u201d when it toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Experts said any move to seize oil reserves as spoils of war would have been in violation of international law, but Trump \u2014 who had floated the idea during his campaign \u2014 brought it up again after taking office.\n\n\u201cWe should have kept the oil, but OK, maybe we\u2019ll have another chance,\u201d the president said on a visit to CIA headquarters a day after being sworn in. In the Arab world, those comments helped fuel a belief in some quarters that U.S. Mideast policy is largely predicated on a wish to plunder the region\u2019s energy resources.\n\nTo many inside and outside Iraq, the travel ban posed the potential to undercut the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, and at the very least provided a propaganda gift to jihadist supporters. Backers of Islamic State were cheering from the social-media sidelines, citing Trump\u2019s move as proof that Muslims would never be accepted by the West.\n\nTwo powerful Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Sunday that the presidential directive could \u201cdo more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security\u201d by inflaming resentments against the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the two said in a joint statement.\n\nSeparately from the consternation in Baghdad, officials in the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan were worried as well. As Iraqi passport holders, its people fall under provisions of the travel ban. That leaves many Iraqi Kurds with U.S. ties in limbo, including students, aid workers and businesspeople.\n\nThe Kurdistan regional government, which has a separate diplomatic mission in Washington, said in a statement that it was trying to get more information from the Trump administration about the order\u2019s scope and effects.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Nabih Bulos", "type": "article"}
