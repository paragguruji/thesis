The order did not specify what kind of money could be pulled.\n\nSan Francisco sued on the same day California lawmakers advanced a bill that would provide statewide sanctuary for immigrants by restricting local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. immigration authorities.\n\nOther sanctuary cities have promised legal action. San Francisco's complaint, filed in Northern California's federal district court, names Trump, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly and acting U.S. Attorney General Dana J. Boente. A spokesman for the president did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAt least 30,000 people live in San Francisco illegally, Herrera said. Sanctuary advocates say communities are better when everyone, regardless of immigration status, feels safe reporting crimes.\n\nSan Francisco receives about $1.2 billion a year in federal funding for services that include housing, health care and homelessness. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the federal government from withholding money.\n\nWashington is seeking to block Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning foreign refugees from entering the United States.

Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who was in the country illegally after multiple deportations to his native Mexico, was charged with murder and pleaded not guilty.\n\nLopez-Sanchez, who told police the gun fired by accident, had been released from a San Francisco jail despite a request from federal immigration authorities that he be held in custody for possible deportation.\n\nTrump often cited the Steinle case during the campaign.\n\nMany other cities and counties in California and across the country refuse to detain immigrants for deportation agents out of legal concerns. A federal court has ruled that immigrants can't be held in jail beyond their scheduled release dates.\n\nSince then, federal agents have been asking law enforcement agencies to provide information about immigrants they are seeking for deportation, if not hold them.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
