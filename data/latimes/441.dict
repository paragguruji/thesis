Buchalter, an Army veteran who works as a law-enforcement instructor at the Department of Homeland Security, had served multiple tours of duty as a military policeman in Iraq, service that cost him dearly.\n\nHe was decorated for injuries sustained from gunfire and improvised explosive devices. Exams revealed he\u2019d suffered herniated discs, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he spent 2 \u00bd years at Walter Reed Army Medical Center trying to get right.\n\nBut he was still alive, and now the married father of two children. And he believes that\u2019s thanks in part to the work of Iraqi interpreters who acted as guides during his work in their country. So he told his younger daughter and son they were going to take a trip: a two-hour drive to Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., where, for the first time in his life, Buchalter would join a protest.\n\n\u201cThis is not what we fought for, having been in Iraq and working with these interpreters,\u201d Buchalter said in a phone interview Sunday. When he saw an Iraqi family emerge from detention, he presented them with something he hoped would convey America\u2019s goodwill \u2014 a Purple Heart.\n\n\u201cKnowing their culture and how they view America, for me, it was a way to send a message to them: What they believe America was, it is,\u201d Buchalter said. \u201cIt's the greatest place in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order Friday to block travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations triggered confusion, fear and anger around the nation as protesters and attorneys gathered at airports to try to force the release of at least dozens of travelers who had unexpectedly become detainees. Many of America\u2019s veterans were among those frustrated by the order, inspired largely by the story of Iraqi interpreter Hameed Khalid Darweesh.\n\nDarweesh, 53, was detained after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, despite holding a special immigrant visa granted to American military translators following a decade of what one U.S. official had deemed \u201cfaithful and valuable service to the United States\u201d in Iraq, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nDarweesh had worked for the U.S. as an interpreter, engineer and contractor from 2003 to 2013, continuing even as Iraqi colleagues were assassinated for their work supporting the American invasion. Now he wanted to immigrate to the U.S. It had taken Darweesh two years of interviews and security screenings to obtain the visa, but, for the moment, all that appeared to be suddenly worthless.\n\nVeterans were infuriated by his story. \u201cThe idea that we would be detaining Iraqi interpreters who put their lives on the line to help troops like myself in Iraq is disgraceful,\u201d wrote veteran Jon Soltz, chairman of an Iraq veterans\u2019 political action committee, VoteVets. The group launched a petition calling on Trump to rescind the visa restrictions and to provide aid for U.S. military interpreters.\n\nThose frustrated by Darweesh\u2019s treatment included one of his former American colleagues in the 101st Airborne division, Brandon Friedman, who had met Darweesh as an infantry lieutenant when the division swept into Baghdad to drive out the forces of Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein.\n\n\u201cHe was anti-Saddam and wanted to help us,\u201d said Friedman, who would go on to work in the Obama administration, recalling how Darweesh accompanied platoons on dangerous missions. \u201cThe guy was absolutely fearless. Guys in our company would go out in all the body armor and everything, and he would go out in khakis and a baseball cap, at least in the beginning.\u201d\n\nNot only was Darweesh\u2019s work essential for soldiers to navigate Iraqi communities, but when a car bomb detonated near the unit\u2019s base, \u201cHe was wounded himself, and he pulled wounded soldiers to safety,\u201d Friedman said. And now veterans who knew Darweesh were upset.\n\n\u201cIf you could see all the Facebook posts from guys in the unit this week, everybody loved him. He was just such an integral part of the unit,\u201d Friedman said. Many veterans were \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to Trump\u2019s blanket exclusion of military interpreters, \u201cbecause if you've been over there, you know their importance,\u201d said Friedman. He called the ban \u201cdeplorable\u201d and said it gives interpreters less incentive to help U.S. troops in the future.\n\nAs public scrutiny grew Saturday, protesters and immigration attorneys massed at airports around the nation, and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Darweesh\u2019s behalf.\n\nDarweesh was freed earlier in the day, and his ACLU lawsuit later led to a late-night ruling from a federal judge in New York, who temporarily barred American officials from deporting arriving travelers who otherwise had legal travel documents.\n\nBut the executive order still makes life uncertain for other Muslims abroad who had assisted the American military and whose hopes for entry to the U.S. have dimmed.\n\nChase Millsap, a former Marine infantry officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, has been trying to help a former Iraqi soldier he served with to gain asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe Iraqi man, whose name Millsap asked be withheld for his safety, fled with his family to southern Turkey in 2014, after Islamic State militants reached the outskirts of Baghdad and began hunting for the soldier\u2019s Shiite family, Millsap said.\n\nThe soldier, whom Millsap nicknamed \u201cthe Captain,\u201d applied for refugee status through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services but has been waiting for a decision for nearly three years.\n\n\u201cThis ban sets the clock back even further \u2014 at least 120 days, and after that who knows if they\u2019re going to pick it back up,\u201d said Millsap, now a writer and filmmaker in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday, after Trump signed the order, Millsap called his friend in Turkey and broke the news. The Iraqi man, who has a wife and two children, and also supports his sister and her three kids, had been taking English classes in anticipation of being allowed to immigrate to the U.S.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a punch to the gut,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cI had to tell him we\u2019ve left him behind and we\u2019re not going to step up and do the right thing, at least right now. \u201cFor him, it was really sad. I could tell the frustration in his voice.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Matt Pearce, Shashank Bengali", "type": "article"}
