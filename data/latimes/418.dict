It also places a suspension on admissions of other citizens of those countries.\n\nThe legal officials represent 15 states. They include California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra and his contemporaries in Washington, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.\n\n\u201cReligious liberty has been, and always will be, a bedrock principle of our country, and no president can change that truth,\u201d the attorneys general said in the statement. They praised the decision of multiple federal courts to order a stay on some aspects of the order.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the Executive Order will ultimately be struck down by the courts,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Ann M.
