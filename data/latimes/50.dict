A federal appeals court zeroes in on the debate", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-travel-ban-20170515-story.html", "text": "A federal appeals court panel of three Democratic appointees grappled with questions Monday over how to determine whether President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban was motivated by religious prejudice or national security.\n\nThe judges of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who listened to arguments for more than an hour in a Seattle courtroom, did not clearly indicate how they were leaning and asked pointed questions of both sides.\n\nBut Judge Ronald M. Gould wanted to know whether there were grounds to continue blocking Trump\u2019s order nationally even if the panel found no constitutional violation of religious freedom guarantees.\n\nAnd Judge Michael Daly Hawkins questioned if the lower court order blocking Trump\u2019s action may have been overly broad.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, directed at six predominantly Muslim countries, did not mention religion though Trump called for a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d when he was running for president.\n\n\u201cHow is a court to know if it is in fact a Muslim ban in the guise of national security justifications?\u201d asked Gould, who, like the other two judges on the panel, was appointed by former President Clinton.\n\nHawkins asked if Trump had ever admitted he was wrong about calling for a Muslim ban or stated that the current order was motivated only by concern for national security.\n\n\u201cHas he ever said anything approaching that?\u201d Hawkins asked skeptically.\n\nActing U.S. Solicitor Gen. Jeffrey B. Wall said Trump has made many statements about pursuing efforts to combat terrorists.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration have argued the court must uphold a presidential order involving national security if it is neutrally worded and there is no clear sign of discriminatory intent.\n\nBut Judge Richard Paez noted the order that led to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was neutrally worded. \u201cThere was no reference to Japanese in that executive order,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd look what happened.\u201d\n\nWall appeared taken aback by the comparison and said he would not have been standing in the courtroom if that was the kind of order before the court.\n\nThe hearing was held in Seattle\u2019 s William K. Nakamura Courthouse, named for a U.S. Medal of Honor winner born in Seattle to Japanese immigrant parents who were interned. Dozens of protesters gathered peacefully on the courthouse steps, chanting and waving signs such as \u201cNo Wall No Ban\u201d and \u201cMuslim Ban is UnAmerican.\u201d\n\nNeal Katyal, a Washington-based lawyer representing the challengers, repeatedly reminded the court of Trump\u2019s critical remarks about Muslims.\n\nBut Paez noted that Trump made his calls for a Muslim ban \u201cin the midst of a highly contentious campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we need to look at it from that standpoint?\u201d Paez asked.\n\nKatyal replied that some of Trump\u2019s comments came even after his election and that a written campaign statement calling for a Muslim ban had remained on the Trump site until the administration removed it on the eve of another federal circuit court hearing earlier this month.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the president is forever barred from issuing an executive order along those lines?\u201d Paez asked.\n\nKatyal said Trump could formally disavow his earlier comments and say Islam was a peaceful religion, as did former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cInstead, we get, \u2018I think Islam hates us,\u2019\u2019\u2019 Katyal said, quoting the president.\n\nThe court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule but did not indicate when it will rule.\n\nThe court is weighing Trump\u2019s appeal of a March decision that put a nationwide hold on his executive order barring U.S. entry by, or visas for, nationals of Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days and blocking all refugees for 120 days.\n\nHawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson issued a preliminary injunction after concluding there was ample evidence to show that anti-Muslim sentiment motivated Trump\u2019s action.\n\nWatson relied on statements Trump and his advisors made about his proposed \u201cMuslim ban\u201d during his campaign and after his election. The judge called the evidence of animus \u201csignificant and unrebutted.\u201d\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia heard arguments this month in a similar challenge of Trump\u2019s travel ban. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to eventually take up the issue.\n\nGould, 70, based in Seattle, is a moderate. Hawkins, 72, based in Phoenix, is considered moderate to liberal. Paez, 70, who serves in Pasadena, is viewed as the most liberal of the three.\n\nThe judges were selected from a computer-generated random list of all panels sitting during the month of May, the earliest the case could be heard.\n\nSome legal experts said it was hard to conclude from the hearing how the judges would rule.\n\n\"It looked like Paez was looking to make a broader decision [against the travel ban] and maybe Hawkins and Gould were looking into a narrower decision,\u201d said Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson. \u201cBut it's difficult to predict.\"\n\nMargo Schlanger, a University of Michigan law professor, called the questions about the internment of Japanese Americans \"very telling.\"\n\n\"The panel seemed clearly to want to avoid a legal standard under which the Japanese internment camps would be constitutional, and that's good news for Hawaii and the plaintiffs,\" said Schlanger, who worked on civil rights in the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration.\n\nUniversity of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said he believed the panel was leaning toward a decision that would continue to block Trump\u2019s order, \u201calthough that is difficult to ascertain with certainty.\u201d\n\nDouglas Kmiec, a professor of constitutional law at Pepperdine University, said he disagreed with the travel order but saw the law and Monday's arguments as being on Trump's side.\n\n\"For Trump to lose on the law, the court would have to ignore the role of the president in foreign affairs,\" said Kmiec, who served in the Department of Justice in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations.\n\nThe state of Hawaii and Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii, challenged Trump\u2019s order, which was a revision of an earlier, broader ban that the 9th Circuit blocked on due process grounds.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "authors": "Maura Dolan, Rick Anderson, Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
