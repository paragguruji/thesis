It will also appear in social media feeds in Canada, Mexico, China, Britain and Australia. Discover Los Angeles doesn\u2019t have any plans currently to buy TV advertising time for the message.\n\nAlthough the video doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name or attack his travel bans, Los Angeles tourism officials said the campaign was intended to fight the message that L.A. doesn\u2019t welcome foreign visitors.\n\n\u201cDiversity and inclusivity have always been cornerstones of Los Angeles culture, but there has never been a more crucial time to reinforce these points,\u201d said Ernest Wooden Jr., chief executive of Discover Los Angeles.\n\nDiversity and inclusivity have always been cornerstones of Los Angeles culture, but there has never been a more crucial time to reinforce these points, \u2014 Ernest Wooden Jr., chief executive of Discover Los Angeles\n\nTrump has attempted to impose two travel bans, both temporarily prohibiting visitors from largely Muslim countries. Both have been blocked by federal courts, pending reviews.\n\nTravel industry experts say they fear that Trump\u2019s bans have sent the message that the U.S. \u2014 home to a $2.1-trillion travel industry \u2014 isn\u2019t open to all tourists.\n\nThere is yet no conclusive data to show that travel has dropped since Trump\u2019s most recent ban was announced. However, a survey of 324 corporate travel managers from the U.S. and Europe found that 37% of U.S. travel managers expect the new ban will reduce travel to the U.S. while 47% of European managers said they expect a reduction.\n\nThe survey, conducted on behalf of the Global Business Travel Assn., a trade group for the world\u2019s business travel managers, also found that the ban made 34% of travel managers worried about harassment of U.S. travelers visiting the Middle East.\n\nLos Angeles County hosted 47.3 million visitors last year, representing the sixth consecutive year of record-breaking tourism.\n\nIn L.A. County, an \u201canti-welcome\u201d message could mean the loss of 800,000 international visitors over a three-year period, according to a forecast by Tourism Economics, an independent research firm. International visitors spend an average of about $920 during each visit Los Angeles, totaling a potential loss of $736 million in direct tourism spending.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
