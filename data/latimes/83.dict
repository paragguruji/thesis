An earlier, more sweeping travel ban was also blocked by federal courts.\n\nThe judges pointed to Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign when he spoke of what he saw as the danger posed by Muslims and the need to keep out Muslim immigrants, refugees and visitors.\n\nTrump later shifted his focus away from religion to nationality, but administration officials frequently portrayed the executive order as a fulfillment of his campaign pledge.\n\n\u201cEven after the second order, there was sort of a wink and nod,\u201d said Judge James A. Wynn Jr., an appointee of President Obama. \u201cAre his statements irrelevant?\u201d\n\nJudge Robert Bruce King noted that Trump\u2019s campaign website still featured his 2015 statement calling for the nationwide Muslim ban. That statement was removed Monday shortly after reporters asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about it during a news briefing.\n\nAt issue is whether the court should look solely at the language of the order, or whether judges should consider the motivations behind the president\u2019s actions, particularly if the intent violates constitutional prohibitions against favoring one religion over another.\n\nA lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union ran into equally sharp questions from several judges who said they did not see why the courts should second-guess the president\u2019s judgment involving a matter of national security. Trump has argued the temporary ban is necessary to protect Americans from possible terrorist attacks.\n\nJudge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, said several of the targeted nations are \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism. People coming from there are high risk. And you are saying there\u2019s something wrong with that?\u201d\n\nHe said judges should not be deciding whether screening at the border is justified. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this stops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s attorney, Omar Jadwat, insisted the Trump\u2019s own words had shown that the travel ban was mostly a gesture toward filling a campaign promise. He said national security experts had said there was no need for shutting off new arrivals from the six countries.\n\nHis legal argument rested on the 1st Amendment\u2019s ban on laws \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Establishment Clause prohibits denigrating and targeting religion,\u201d he said.\n\nJadwat\u2019s best moment came when he asked the judges to consider the possibility of a hypothetical anti-Semitic president who says, \u201cI don\u2019t like Jews. I don\u2019t want them in the country.\u201d Then, after being elected, he issues an executive order banning new arrivals from Israel because that nation has experienced terrorism. Judges should have no trouble concluding such an order would be illegitimate and unconstitutional, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeffrey Wall, acting U.S. solicitor general, argued that Supreme Court\u2019s precedents give the chief executive broad power to restrict foreigners from entering the country. He repeatedly cited a 1972 decision in which the justices upheld an order denying a visa to a Belgian communist who was due to speak at Stanford University. Professors had sued citing the 1st Amendment and the freedom of speech, but the high court said it would not second-guess the government\u2019s reason for denying the visa.\n\nSo long as the president \u201cputs forth a reason that is on its face legitimate,\u201d Wall argued, the order restricting new arrivals should be upheld. In this instance, the president\u2019s reason involved terrorism and national security. Trump and his advisors said they worried the governments of these countries \u2014 including Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 could not provide \u201creliable information to screen\u201d people who wanted to come to the United States.\n\nThe full 4th Circuit was hearing the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of a ruling by a U.S. district judge in Maryland who blocked a scaled-down travel ban from taking effect. The original order was blocked by the 9th Circuit on Feb. 9, dealing the Trump White House a major legal defeat in its third week on the job.\n\nOn May 15, the 9th Circuit Court, sitting in Seattle, will hear a similar appeal of the second order, which was also blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii.\n\nIf the administration loses in either of the appeals courts, its lawyers are likely to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile the judges argued back and forth over whether Trump\u2019s order was based on national security or religious discrimination, several asked about procedure issues.\n\nIt is possible the court could toss out all or part of the case because only one plaintiff appears to have standing. To have a valid case, the judges said someone in the United States has to show he or she is facing harm because a relative abroad has been denied a visa as a result of the order.\n\nWall also urged the judges to narrow the Maryland district judge\u2019s ruling. It should apply only to the single plaintiff, he said, not the entire nation.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
