Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation to ban bump stocks by law, only fellow Democrats joined with her.\n\nBy Thursday, however, top GOP leaders in the House and Senate, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, signaled their interest in working on legislation that that could limit access to the devices.\n\n\"Clearly that\u2019s something we need to look into,\" Ryan told MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt in an interview scheduled to air this weekend.\n\nSenators on Thursday morning privately discussed ways they could tackle the issue as they met for routine business.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that the unique aspect of the bump stock and how you would literally transform a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon is something that I think bears looking into,\" Cornyn told Texas reporters on a conference call.\n\nHe has asked Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa to convene a hearing \"and look into it.\"\n\nEven Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus of conservative hard-liners, told reporters earlier in the week he'd be willing to consider banning bump stocks, if the Senate passes a bill and sends it to the House.\n\nThe shift is notable for Republicans who, under great pressure from the NRA and other gun rights groups, have resisted past efforts at gun control, even after some of the most devastating mass shootings in the United States.\n\nComing after the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 dead and hundreds wounded in what authorities said is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, the movement may indicate the potential limits of the gun lobby's reach into politics and policy.\n\nPolls show Americans overwhelmingly want measures that could curb gun violence and pressure has mounted as cultural figures, including late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel, have delivered heart-wrenching criticisms of congressional inaction.\n\nDemocrats, who have at times splintered on firearms issues as conservative-state lawmakers joined Republicans to defeat gun-safety bills, welcomed the changed outlook.\n\nThey have called on President Trump to cut across partisan lines and push Congress toward legislation to reduce gun violence that polls show most Americans would support.\n\n\"Will the president stand up?\" said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York. \"The president has a choice.\"\n\nMany Democrats, however, will not want to limit action to bump stocks.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said bump stock legislation was one approach, but no substitute for a background check bill that she said would have bipartisan support in the House if Ryan would allow a vote.\n\n\"It really is all up to the speaker,\" she said. \"Is he going to bring the bill to the floor?\"\n\nAt the same time, lawmakers were skeptical that initial interest in limited bipartisan legislation would translate into enough actual votes to write the restriction into law.\n\n\"We need to move Republicans from being open to the idea to being willing to actually work on it,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has become a leader on firearms safety measures since the 2012 killings of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.\n\nOne key Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who co-sponsored a bipartisan background check bill that was defeated a few years ago, was noncommittal Thursday. He said he was just learning about bump stocks and needed more information.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters it was too soon, as the investigation in Las Vegas was just underway, to consider legislation.\n\nLawmakers, though, appeared concerned that the device offers a way to get around the existing ban on automatic weapons, which have been outlawed for years except for military use.\n\nIn the House, several military veterans, led by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, sent a letter to federal officials asking them to reconsider how they regulate the devices. During the Obama administration, the ATF authorized use of the stocks.\n\n\"This is definitely an area we're going to look [at],\" Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield said on Fox News.\n\nA number of lawmakers, including Ryan, an avid hunter, said they were unfamiliar with bump stocks before the Las Vegas shooting. The alleged gunman appears to have used the device for rapid shooting.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-07", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
