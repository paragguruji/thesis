Gregory of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in his ruling.\n\nRead the 4th Circuit\u2019s decision to uphold the block on Trump\u2019s travel ban\n\nThe 10-3 ruling included numerous citations to campaign statements in which Trump called for a ban on Muslims immigrating to the United States. The plaintiffs who have challenged the travel order have argued that it is a disguised version of the Muslim ban that he called for during the campaign.\n\nTrump's statements \"provide direct, specific evidence of what motivated both EO-1 and EO-2,\" the court said, referring to ther first and second versions of the travel order: \"President Trump\u2019s desire to exclude Muslims from the United States.\"\n\nThe 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., is one of two appeals courts that have recently heard arguments on the travel ban. A similar case is pending before the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-02", "authors": "David Lauter", "type": "article"}
