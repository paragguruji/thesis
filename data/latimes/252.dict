Chuang closely questioned both sides during nearly two hours of arguments. He pushed the government to explain how the reworked measure would address previous legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle last month brought a national halt to implementation of the first travel order, and his decision was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nChuang also questioned the plaintiffs: \"The government says the executive order is to protect the public. On what basis can I overrule that?\"\n\nThe case was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of immigrants, including those from Syria, Somalia and Iran whose spouses and families are in the middle of the visa approval process to come to the U.S. The suit argues that the new executive order, which pauses refugee resettlement and travel from nationals of six Muslim-majority countries, will prevent family reunification and discriminates on the basis of religion.\n\nThe intent of both executive orders, Trump administration officials say, is to screen out visitors from countries affected by terrorism until more stringent vetting measures can be put in place.\n\nThe new order has been stripped of many provisions that federal judges across the country found troublesome in the first one. The order applies to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Yemen (it does not include Iraq, as the previous order did). It no longer gives preference to religious minorities in refugee admissions. And it exempts several categories of people from its restrictions, including dual nationals who have U.S. citizenship, green card holders and people who already hold valid visas.\n\nTwo additional federal cases challenging the revised travel ban also will be heard Wednesday in federal courts in Hawaii and Washington state.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Laura King and Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
