{"title": "Supreme Court lets Trump administration reinstate travel ban restrictions on refugees but not on grandparents", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-travel-ban-20170719-story.html", "text": "Supreme Court justices said Wednesday that the Trump administration could temporarily reinstate restrictions on refugee resettlement, but that it could not limit the kinds of \u201cclose\u201d family members exempt from a ban on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries.\n\nLegal experts said the mixed directive was another sign that the court\u2019s conservative wing is far from being in lockstep with the administration as it considers the case over the limits to executive power on immigration and national security.\n\nThe justices overruled a Hawaii federal judge less than a week after he said tens of thousands of refugees could come into the country despite President Trump\u2019s travel ban, which applies to refugees from any country.\n\nBut they agreed with the judge in saying that the government could not block close relatives, such as grandchildren who want to visit grandparents living in the U.S.\n\nThe high court\u2019s one-paragraph order gave no reasoning for its decision, and said it was up to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to further consider which refugees and family members are included in the ban before justices hear arguments on the executive order Oct. 10.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have let the government further restrict the kinds of \u201cclose\u201d family exempt from the ban. The same justices \u2014 considered the most conservative on the court \u2014 dissented from the court\u2019s June decision to revive the travel ban with exceptions for certain travelers, saying the ban should be brought back without changes.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy are also conservatives, though Kennedy is considered a swing vote on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe can certainly start to read the tea leaves,\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cThe most conservative of the conservatives on the court have been consistent on the travel ban. But three is not a majority.\u201d\n\nLevinson cautioned that justices had not heard arguments over the ban yet, and could decide by the end of the next term that the issue was moot. That\u2019s because Trump has presented his travel order as a temporary anti-terrorism measure while the government reviews vetting procedures.\n\nNicole Navas, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said that the administration \u201clooks forward to presenting its arguments to the 9th Circuit.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ban halts travel into the U.S. by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran for 90 days and stops all refugee resettlement for 120 days. Federal courts had blocked the order from January, when an original, broader version of it was signed, until the Supreme Court brought it back to life last month.\n\nSince the revised ban went into effect June 29, the state of Hawaii has fought the Trump administration in federal courts over whom it includes. The Supreme Court allowed the ban as long as people with \u201cbona fide\u201d connections to the U.S., such as close family, employment, university admission or relationships with other institutions, were exempt.\n\nThe court mostly left those exceptions up to interpretation.\n\nThe government argues that the connections should include a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and parents-in-law.\n\nBut it says grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law are not close enough to qualify for admission.\n\nLawyers representing Hawaii won an injunction limiting the travel ban after they challenged the government\u2019s definitions in a Honolulu federal district court. The state, which is among those challenging Trump\u2019s order in the Supreme Court, also argued that a refugee resettlement organization\u2019s interactions with a refugee constituted a bona fide relationship. It said that about 24,000 refugees had formal assurances from resettlement agencies for relocation assistance. It said those relationships should be counted as a \u201cbona fide.\u201d\n\nOn July 13, one day after the U.S. hit a 50,000 cap on refugee admissions that blocked all refugees except those with close family in the country, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson issued an order largely granting Hawaii\u2019s requests.\n\nThe Department of Justice challenged his order in the 9th Circuit and in the Supreme Court.\n\nBut \u201cthe court refused to grant the government\u2019s request to clarify its June ruling on close family relationships,\u201d said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.\n\nImmigrant and refugee advocates had mixed reactions to Wednesday\u2019s order.\n\n\"The International Rescue Committee is relieved for families \u2014 including grandmothers, grandchildren, and critical extended relations \u2014 who will now be able to find safety and stability in the United States because of today's clarification,\u201d Hans Van de Weerd, the vice president for U.S. programs at the resettlement organization, said in a statement. \u201cFurther, the IRC hopes that resettlement agencies, which have prepared extensively for assured refugees' arrival and smooth adjustment, are found to qualify as bona fide relationships.\u201d\n\nAn attorney representing the state of Hawaii, Neal Katyal, said on Twitter that the government\u2019s request was \u201cnot properly\u201d before the Supreme Court and that he was ready to keep fighting the Trump administration in the 9th Circuit.\n\n\u201cSee you in court!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
