They\u2019re not political refugees like we were. There are two types of people who want to come to America \u2014 those who seek freedom and those who go out to destroy it.\u201d\n\nBut Tran\u2019s grandson takes a decidedly grimmer view of Trump\u2019s crackdown, and that speaks to a larger generational divide in a community so profoundly built around its refugee roots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little racist to consider that Muslims are terrorists and to think that if one Muslim does something bad, others are like him too. That\u2019s not what I was taught,\u201d Kevin Tran, 14, said.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj \u00bb\n\nThe teenager, an eighth-grader at Emmaus Lutheran School in Alhambra, was born in California, but like most young Vietnamese Americans he is the fruit of the mass exodus out of Vietnam into the U.S. after the war ended in 1975. In Orange County, they created the largest population of people of Vietnamese descent outside of of Vietnam: more than 300,000, with thousands of businesses scattered across Westminster, Garden Grove, Fountain Valley and Santa Ana.\n\nThat community got its start when President Gerald Ford allowed thousands of Vietnamese refugees fleeing the fall of Saigon and the victory of the communist North Vietnam government to resettle in America.\n\nLike many Vietnamese Americans of his generation, Steve Tran is a loyal Republican.\n\nUnlike his immigrant grandfather, Kevin has lived much of his life, including in classrooms, surrounded by people of differing cultures, races and religions.\n\nThis younger generation has become increasingly more liberal and more likely to be Democrats, according to experts who view the generational shift as partly a product of socialization.\n\n\u201cThe elders may be openly supporting Trump and the Republicans because they still feel an affinity for the party they view as fighting against the government that took over their homeland,\u201d said Linda Vo, a professor of Asian American studies at UC Irvine. \u201cMeanwhile, the younger folks are raised here. They share the experiences of other communities of color. They see more ethnic and religious differences, and their minds open up. They empathize with many cultural groups.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the first generation \u2014 the refugee generation \u2014 was hamstrung by language barriers that limited their interaction with the broader society and other groups, Vo added.\n\nKevin said his history teacher and his father, Donald Tran, both urged him to study the immigrant experience \u201cbecause it helps me relate it to my own experience.\u201d\n\nBut when it came to Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which critics have called a Muslim ban \u2014 Kevin and his father came to wholly different conclusions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be sad if we lived in an America that didn\u2019t accept my dad when he first got here,\u201d the teenager said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the man he is without being able to live the way he wanted, and a bunch of people like the Vietnamese could have died. So why would we ban immigrants?\u201d\n\nMark Boster / Los Angeles Times At Lee's Sandwiches in Westminster, the post-lunch crowd is quieter after rounds of rapid orders when customers shared the latest community and government news.

(Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn 1975, Viet Thanh Nguyen and his older brother and parents joined the first wave of Vietnamese fleeing the victorious communist government, ending up in Ft. Indiantown Gap, a resettlement camp in Pennsylvania.\n\nThey had to find sponsors to exit the refugee camp. For a while, the family split up. Nguyen was 4.\n\nThe haunting experience inspired the USC professor decades later when he published his first novel, \u201cThe Sympathizer,\u201d which won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2016.\n\nHis newest book is called \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d a collection of short stories reflecting his mission to capture the immigrant voice \u201cin pain and in happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t think Vietnamese refugees are very different from other refugees, though there\u2019s so much judgment,\u201d Nguyen, 45, said. \u201cSome of us refugees are perfectly comfortable with the idea that America can include the Vietnamese language in all its diversity, yet it can\u2019t even include the presence of Syrians.\u201d\n\nHe said he believes that the unstable, chaotic nature of refugees\u2019 lives makes people fundamentally uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cPeople who are displaced by war or by political disasters remind us that we have a lot we can lose,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cMaybe this is why refugees aren\u2019t welcomed.\u201d\n\nAt the Asian Garden Mall in Westminster, Ba Nguyen, 70, a retired pilot from Garden Grove, said he shied from questioning \u201call of these orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a citizen, you need to support your president,\u201d he added firmly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, it\u2019s like a child living in your father\u2019s house going against his own teaching. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nJust steps away, Cheryl Tran finished her papaya salad. The 40-year-old worker at a senior center was critical of Trump\u2019s decision. She left Vietnam in 1988 with her half-sister, who was granted passage because her father was American.\n\n\u201cWe can have terrorists from the inside \u2014 it\u2019s not just from the outside. Didn\u2019t they realize this when they tried to create a ban?\u201d asked Tran. \u201cThe tendency is to improve yourself, then improve your surroundings. It\u2019s the energy of immigrant groups that built America.\u201d\n\nHoi Trinh, a lawyer who for decades has worked to resettle displaced families from Southeast Asia, said Vietnamese immigrants know what it\u2019s like to flee the places you called home.\n\n\u201cOur Viet community is primarily a refugee community. We should always defend and protect refugee rights. It is both our privilege and our responsibility,\u201d said Trinh, 46, whose father was sent to a reeducation camp at the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nCommunist officials banished the rest of his family to the \u201cnew economic zones,\u201d which were often uninhabited mountainous areas with harsh living conditions. There they languished until 1980, after his father\u2019s release, when he, his parents and siblings escaped by boat and eventually settled in Melbourne, Australia. He was 14.\n\n\u201cI would be farming now,\u201d Trinh said, \u201cif I had no opportunity for this new life.\u201d\n\nDanny Nguyen\u2019s father is a graphic designer, his mother a hairstylist. The way the 23-year-old Orange Coast College student sees it, they live in the U.S. only \u201cbecause America has always been a welcoming place.\u201d\n\nMost of his friends are Vietnamese Americans, whose parents have tales about their own postwar escapes from the place of their birth.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-19", "authors": "Anh Do", "type": "article"}
