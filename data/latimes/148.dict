This could lead to a 4-4 decision, which would leave the lower court\u2019s rulings in place.\n\n\n\nStill, this article focused on an American Bar Assn. analysis from 2010, which found that eight of out of 10 cases from the 9th Circuit that are reviewed by the Supreme Court are overruled.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 9th Circuit, which is known for its liberal tendencies, has the second-highest reversal rate of the 13 appellate courts below the Supreme Court,\u201d the analysis noted.\n\n\n\nIt is notable that the appellate panel which heard the case this week, comprised of three judges -- two Democratic appointees and one appointed by a Republican -- unanimously ruled against Trump.\n\nAnalysis: Ninth Circuit would allow 9/11 hijacker to sue to come to U.S. (Breitbart)\n\nTrump says it\u2019s all about safety.\n\nThis analysis piece argues that the 9th Circuit ruling would allow a 9/11 terrorist to sue the government to stay in the United States.\n\nHani Hasan Hanjour was one of the four pilot hijackers and \u201cwas from Saudi Arabia, a country not covered by the executive order,\u201d wrote Joel B. Pollak.\n\n\u201cBy the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, however, Hanjour would have due process rights to challenge his exclusion from the United States once he had been granted a student visa,\u201d Pollak wrote. \u201cHis relationship with a U.S. \u2018institution\u2019 \u2014 in this case, an English as a Second Language school in Oakland, California \u2014 would have been enough to grant him standing. A state could have sued on his behalf even while he was still abroad.\u201d\n\nThe Donald v. The Judges (American Spectator)\n\nSince he entered office on Jan. 20, it seems Trump has consistently battled judges. First it was U.S. District Judge James Robart in Washington state. Then, the judges of the 9th Circuit Court. His administration has even faced questions about whether he\u2019s battling with Gorsuch, who has called some of Trump\u2019s comments about the judges in the case \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d\n\nThis article argues that it\u2019s indeed not new for a president to battle the courts and create immigration bans.\n\n\u201cNot only does history offer precedent for the president\u2019s 'unprecedented' criticism of the judiciary, so too does it provide ample examples of past chief executives restricting immigration based on broad-brush classifications such as national origin,\u201d wrote Daniel J. Flynn.\n\n\u201cPresident Franklin Roosevelt banned Japanese, Germans, and Italians from American soil by fiat the day after Pearl Harbor. Unlike Trump, he did not merely suspend entry for 90 days to check their backgrounds. The fact that they came from Japan, Germany, or Italy was all he needed to prohibit entry. While not all past restrictions appear as wise in retrospect as Roosevelt\u2019s, this does not mark them as unlawful.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
