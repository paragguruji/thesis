L.A. elected officials and Muslim leaders decry Trump's travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-faith-leaders-trump-ban-20170201-story.html", "text": "Los Angeles city leaders passionately decried President Trump\u2019s travel ban Wednesday during a gathering at the Islamic Center of Southern California and called upon residents to show solidarity with the local Muslim community.\n\n\u201cWe will resist any attempt from the Trump administration, or any other entity, that threatens the rights of any of us or the values we cherish the most,\u201d said Councilman Mitch O\u2019Farrell, who organized the event. \"We must always lean against the darkness of ignorance and exclusion.\u201d\n\nSigned Friday, the executive order blocks travel from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days and suspends all refugee admissions to the U.S. for 120 days. The order also bars indefinitely the admission of Syrian refugees.\n\nO\u2019Farrell said he began reaching out to fellow leaders immediately after the order was announced, believing that they must quickly take a public and united stand against what is \u201canathema to human decency and basic civil rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office, the Los Angeles metro area has about 161,000 residents born in the countries listed in the travel ban, by far the highest number in the nation.\n\n\u201cIn the City of Angels, tolerance, inclusion and compassion are part of our DNA,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said. \"We are a refuge of sorts \u2014 for immigrants from across the world and, like myself, migrants from other states. One can make a new life here, free of the constraints and sometimes oppression that may exist from where we came.\u201d\n\nThe gathering came days after thousands rallied at Los Angeles International Airport as attorneys scrambled to file documents to free those detained. City Atty. Mike Feuer, who had been concerned that federal officials were not complying with a judicial order that prevented detainees from being deported, said earlier that he witnessed a \u201cbreathtaking violation of rights\u201d at the airport.\n\nHe also was repeatedly denied access to federal detainees or an attorney who could discuss the situation, he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Feuer announced that a team of lawyers in his office were \u201clooking at every step we can effectively take to defend our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel so strongly that this moment right now may be the defining moment in our lives,\u201d he added. \u201cThe real America needs to rise up and make itself heard.\u201d\n\nThe chairwoman of the Islamic Center said the words of city leaders have given her hope, but that she still wakes up in fear.\n\n\"When our policymakers say Islam hates us \u2026 they paintbrush a whole faith,\u201d Hedab Tarifi said. \u201cIt worries me that a war is being waged that has no foundation.\"\n\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said he fields calls from people worried about traveling and being caught up in a nightmare.\n\nHe puts them in touch with legal help and encourages them to continue on with their plans.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, when you scapegoat a whole community, you do not bring security to the American people, you only bring more fear and hysteria,\u201d he said.\n\nAll community members are invited to a rally beginning at the Islamic Center scheduled for Feb. 19 that intends to \"underscore the point of pluralism,\" he said.\n\nWe are brothers, we are sisters with one another, and we are, as a city, one. \u2014 Ron Galperin, Los Angeles city controller\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti asked the city to acknowledge that it has long been a haven for immigrants and that the current fight involves legal residents who have gone through the \u201cpainstaking\u201d process of filing the proper documents.\n\nHe compared the fight against Trump\u2019s order to the civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about fighting one person,\u201d Garcetti said, \u201cthis is about standing up for joint values. \u2026 Everybody deserves to be at the lunch counter.\u201d\n\nCity Controller Ron Galperin recalled how his father, who escaped Romania during the Holocaust, made his way through Turkey, Syria and Lebanon before landing at a British internment camp in Israel, which was then Palestine.\n\nHis father's plans to immigrate to the United States were hindered by restrictions during the Cold War. A U.S. senator heard of his plight and pushed legislation that allowed him to arrive in 1956.\n\nGalperin, the first in his family to be born an American, said he feels a responsibility to make sure others have the same opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe are brothers, we are sisters with one another, and we are, as a city, one.\"\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
