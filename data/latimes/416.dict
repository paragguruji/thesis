Inslee and I were in the same high school graduating class in Seattle, as were both our wives. In fact, I\u2019ve known the state\u2019s first lady, Trudi Inslee, since sixth grade, so this was a friends and family event.\n\nSomewhere near midnight, after the big party was over, I was hanging out with Inslee in the kitchen at the governor\u2019s mansion. I asked him what he thought of the decision by California\u2019s legislative leaders to hire President Obama\u2019s former attorney general, Eric Holder, to advise them on ways to fight the Trump administration in court. Inslee indicated he was all for resistance. He said he was already conferring with \u201cthe two Browns\u201d \u2014 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and California Gov. Jerry Brown \u2014 to coordinate efforts.\n\nNow, that resistance has come to fruition in the lawsuit brought by Washington state to block Trump\u2019s travel ban aimed at immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Washington Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson has been all over cable news talking about what, so far, has been a successful effort. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on the dispute. However the court rules, the case is expected to go on to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates the importance of governors and states in the four-year battle to preserve the fundamental values of this country,\u201d Inslee told the Washington Post. \u201cThe nation needs checks against a president who\u2019s prone to rogue behavior, and governors will assume a more important place in the democratic system.\u201d\n\nWest Coast governors have made it clear they intend to oppose President Trump on a full range of issues \u2014 climate change, energy, healthcare, same-sex marriage, immigration and more. Oregon is officially a \u201csanctuary state\u201d and Kate Brown, speaking about the immigration ban, said, \u201cI will uphold the civil and human rights of all who call Oregon home.\u201d She has been joined in that opposition by all but one of the members of Oregon\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Gov. Brown has said his state will resist what he called the \u201cmiasma of nonsense\u201d emanating from the Trump White House. Dealing seriously with the challenge of climate change has been a central focus throughout Brown\u2019s years as governor and, in a December speech before the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, he declared his intention to push back against the climate change deniers who are ascendant with Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\"We've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight,\u201d Brown said of his state. If the Trump administration shuts down NASA\u2019s climate research satellites, Brown said, \u201cCalifornia will launch its own damn satellite.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials in the three states are getting backing from many of the major companies that fuel the West Coast economy. Forbes magazine identifies 126 tech companies that have signed on to Washington state\u2019s brief against the travel ban, and most on the list are based in cities stretching from Los Angeles to Seattle, including SpaceX, Tesla, Apple, Google, Airbnb, Uber and Microsoft. Seattle-based Amazon filed a separate declaration of support. Adidas, the German company whose U.S. headquarters is in Portland, announced opposition to the ban, as did the chief executives of Oregon-based Nike and one of Oregon\u2019s largest employers, Intel.\n\nOne out of every eight Americans lives in California, now an estimated 39 million people. Add in the 7 million-plus in Washington and Oregon\u2019s 4 million, and you are talking about a lot of voters.\n\nCalifornians pay more federal taxes to the federal government than any other state and, per capita, get far less back in federal support than many other states. Trump has threatened to \u201cdefund\u201d California if the state gets too ornery. One wonders if California could defund the federal government in return.\n\nWhether such a thing is possible, it is clear that Trump, the man who wants to build a big wall on the border, is running into a massive wall himself. It is called the West Coast.\n\nDavid.Horsey@latimes.com\n\nFollow me at @davidhorsey on Twitter\n\nMORE TOP OF THE TICKET\n\nTrump\u2019s rationalization for 'killer' Putin is ignorant and anti-American\n\nAmerica\u2019s fate is in the hands of Trump\u2019s bizarre inner circle of advisors\n\nFrom cable TV to cattlemen\u2019s websites, flood of Trump news swamps the media", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "David Horsey", "type": "article"}
