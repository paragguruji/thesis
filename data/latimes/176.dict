But they are likely to fire up a base that is demanding Democrats in California and elsewhere do everything they can to counter Trump.\n\nFeinstein filed a bill to rescind the executive order Monday \u2014 it is backed by 37 fellow Democratic senators. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) supports the measure, her staff said. Lofgren's bill, filed late last week, would halt the order and cut off any funds to implement it. It's backed by 172 House Democrats, including 32 of her 39 California House Democratic colleagues.\n\nTrump's narrower temporary ban on travel to the United States by citizens from six majority-Muslim countries goes into effect this week. A broader executive order by Trump had previously been put on hold by the courts. On Monday, California joined six states challenging the new order in court.\n\n\u201cThis revised order is no less a violation of the bedrock American principle of freedom of belief than the original,\u201d Lofgren said in a statement.\n\nCongress has the authority to revoke all or part of some executive orders by either directly repealing the order, or cutting off funding to implement it.\n\nOnly about 4% of executive orders since 1936 have been modified by Congress, according to a 2006 report by Clemson University assistant political science professor Adam L.
