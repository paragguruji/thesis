{"title": "New travel ban. Same response from Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-tech-executive-order-20170307-story.html", "text": "President Trump\u2019s new travel ban was revised to pass legal muster, but the changes did nothing to win support in Silicon Valley, where signs of political activism remain on the rise.\n\nThe executive order issued Monday suspends entry for residents of six Muslim-majority countries and blocks refugees from around the world. Unlike the first travel ban, which was issued a week after Trump took office, the new order does not include Iraq and ensures that holders of visas and green cards can come into the U.S.\n\nThe tweaks did not appease some in the tech world \u2014 an industry that has loudly voiced its opposition to the administration\u2019s border and immigration policies in part because they hinder its ability to hire badly needed talent from overseas.\n\n\u201cLyft stands firmly against this order. We will continue to speak out and take action when the values of our community are put at risk,\u201d Logan Green, chief executive of the ride-hailing service, said in a statement, adding that he planned to meet Wednesday with representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union to offer help.\n\nAirbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky tweeted: \u201cBarring people from entering our country because of where they\u2019re from was wrong the first time around - still wrong...\u201d\n\nMarc Benioff, chief executive of business software firm Salesforce, said in a tweet that the new ban made him think of his grandfather, a refugee from Ukraine. And Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder and now chief executive of lending start-up Affirm, said in a tweet that the policies put forth by the White House make \u201cCanada look really attractive for tech.\u201d\n\nUber Inc. released a statement saying, \u201cOur sentiment has not changed: President Trump's immigration ban is unjust and wrong. We will continue to stand up for those in the Uber community affected.\u201d\n\nUber faced criticism in January because it appeared to advertise its continued operation at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport during a taxi driver\u2019s strike opposing the initial travel ban. That move, coupled with Chief Executive Travis Kalanick\u2019s role on Trump\u2019s business advisory group, sparked a backlash against Uber that cost the company thousands of customers. Kalanick has since resigned from the advisory board.\n\nSome of the industry\u2019s biggest names \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 remained silent and did not respond to requests for comment on the new ban. A Twitter spokesman directed a reporter to a statement from the Information Technology Industry Council, which called on Washington to reform immigration laws so that it\u2019s easier for companies to hire from abroad.\n\n\u201cThe values and value that immigrants bring to our nation are a key source of American optimism and exceptionalism,\u201d said Dean Garfield, president and chief executive of the trade group, whose membership includes Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter.\n\nThose same companies were among the more than 100 tech firms that joined a court brief opposing the first travel ban. That was a rare show of unity and activism in an industry long criticized for not being more outspoken on political and social issues despite its immense influence and massive wealth.\n\nOne issue on which Silicon Valley hasn\u2019t been shy about expressing its opinion is immigration. A study released last year by the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy said immigrants founded just over half the nation\u2019s start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.\n\nThe tech industry relies on foreign-born workers to fill out its ranks and has leaned heavily on temporary H-1B visas to bring in skilled employees.\n\nBut on Friday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would suspend for up to six months expedited processing of H-1B visas, starting April 3. The service shortens wait periods for the visas from months to weeks for those willing to pay the $1,225 fee.\n\n\u201cA lot of tech companies and start-ups in the Valley rely on the H-1B visa program to attract and retain top talent,\u201d said Los Angeles immigration attorney Ayda Akalin. \u201cIt can be quite competitive, especially for venture-backed start-ups who need to hire, build and scale as quickly as possible. Most companies fork over the extra fee for premium processing so that they can properly assess hiring needs. This is certainly going to be disruptive to that.\u201d\n\nChanges to the visa rules will be at the center of a demonstration called Tech Stands Up, scheduled for March 14, with about 1,600 people saying they will walk off their jobs in Palo Alto. The protest is described on its Facebook page as \u201ca grassroots movement giving a voice to the rapidly growing concerns about the Trump administration's policies affecting the tech community and its users.\u201d\n\nDespite the industry's increasing outspokenness on the issue, the event\u2019s organizer, software engineer Brad Taylor, told Axios he planned the walkout because he wanted an even more vocal response.\n\n\u201cI was sick of the silence,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
