Yolanda Choates, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, declined to comment about Khan specifically.\n\nShe said in and email that the agency would notify people who were losing their membership in the Global Entry program -- which allows pre-screened travelers to speed through customs upon arriving in the country -- though there's no indication that is what happened to Khan.\n\n\u201cOf course, any U.S. citizen with a passport may travel without trusted traveler status,\u201d she said.\n\nKhan could not be reached for comment, and the event organizer, Ramsay Talks, did not respond to an email, text message or phone message.\n\nKhan was scheduled to speak Tuesday at a luncheon hosted by the Toronto-based organization.\n\nThe two-hour event was slated to include a presentation and question-and-answer session on \"what we can do about the appalling turn of events in Washington -- so that we don\u2019t all end up sacrificing everything,\" according to the organizer.\n\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, the organizer said Khan was not told why his travel status was under review.\n\n\"This turn of events is not just of deep concern to me but to all my fellow Americans who cherish our freedom to travel abroad,\" Khan said in the statement. \"I have not been given any reason as to why. I am grateful for your support and look forward to visiting Toronto in the near future.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Alene Tchekmedyian", "type": "article"}
