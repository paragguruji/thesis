{"title": "Melissa McCarthy is scathing as Sean Spicer on 'Saturday Night Live'", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-melissa-mccarthy-snl-sean-spicer-trump-20170205-story.html", "text": "With satirical jabs at everything from the so-called \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d to the travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d delivered one of its most hard-hitting, hilarious and ambitious episodes this weekend in a show revolving around President Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office.\n\nPlayers and guests Kristen Stewart and Alec Baldwin riffed on the Mexican wall, the president\u2019s disastrous phone calls with world leaders, his obsession with \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d ratings and the influence of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 chaotic and seemingly made-for-comedy events that have marked the debut of Trump\u2019s newest public role, POTUS.\n\nSaturday\u2019s had to be the commander in chief\u2019s least favorite episode since Baldwin began lampooning his debate performances more than a year ago. (Awaiting his reaction tweet now.) From its cold opening in the Oval Office to a monologue by Stewart reading Trump\u2019s litany of real tweets about her former relationship with \u201cTwilight\u201d co-star Robert Pattinson.\n\nDonald Trump admits he likes Alec Baldwin, but not his 'mean-spirited' 'SNL' imitation \u00bb\n\nBut it was surprise guest Melissa McCarthy\u2019s portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, in a skit about the administration\u2019s contentious relationship with the news media, that made the evening one of \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d best since it began satirizing the new president and his Cabinet.\n\nDressed in a suit and armed with an adversarial attitude, she addressed the room full of reporters:\n\n\u201cMyself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I say rocky start I mean it in the sense of \u2018Rocky\u2019 the movie because I came out here to punch you in the face\u2026 I\u2019d like to begin today by apologizing on behalf of you, to me, for how you have treated me these last two weeks. And that apology is not accepted!\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s Spicer then took questions from the reporters including one from the New York Times about \u201cthe travel ban on Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a ban. The travel ban is not a ban, which makes it not a ban,\u201d said McCarthy as Spicer.\n\n\u201cBut you just called it a ban\u2026\u201d replied Bobby Moynihan, portraying New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m using your words. You said ban. You said ban. Now I\u2019m saying it back,\u201d she retorted, and on it went until finally devolving into prop comedy.\n\nThe bit followed Stewart\u2019s monologue, during which she admitted she was nervous because she knew Trump was probably watching.\n\nShe then outlined Trump\u2019s interest \u2014 11 tweets \u2014 in her former relationship with Pattinson. \"We broke up and then we got back together and for some reason it made Donald Trump go insane,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued: \"The president is not a huge fan of me. But that is so OK. And, Donald, if you didn't like me then you're really probably not going to like me now 'cause I'm hosting 'SNL' and I'm like, so gay, dude.\"\n\n(Later, near the end of the monologue, Stewart accidentally dropped an f-bomb that was unrelated to Trump.)\n\nA skit starring Baldwin lampooned the relationship between Trump and his advisor Bannon, former head of the far-right website Breitbart News Network.\n\nThe skit played off of question of just who is in charge, Trump or Bannon. Pundits and many on Capitol Hill have increasingly questioned the amount of influence Bannon \u2014 a man with little more political experience than Trump \u2014 has now on forming policy and making critical national decisions.\n\nIn the skit, Bannon again was depicted as the Grim Reaper. He hovered in the background, encouraging Trump to pick up the phone and make impromptu calls to leaders of allied countries \u2014 Australia, Mexico, Germany. One by one, he alienated them as Bannon rubbed his skeletal hands together, as if his plan for mass chaos and destruction was well on its way.\n\nWho could have guessed America\u2019s least popular presidency would be a boon for \u201cSNL\u201d? Just about everyone.\n\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei CAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A.
