The judge in his ruling did not address the state's claim that the immigration ban is unconstitutional.\n\nThe court order said enforcement of the executive order signed by President Trump last week must be suspended until the judge can make a final decision.\n\nThe judge declined a request from a Department of Justice attorney to stay the order, but it's expected that the administration will appeal the decision.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution prevailed today,\u201d Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. \u201cNo one is above the law \u2014 not even the President.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision shuts down the executive order immediately, shuts it down. That relief is immediate, happens right now. That\u2019s the bottom line,\" he said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Rick Anderson and Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
