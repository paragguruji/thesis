The order temporarily halted all refugees and barred entry into the U.S. for people from seven majority-Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nDemocrats and civil liberties groups have decried the order as unfairly targeting Muslims, and security experts said it could do more harm than good by stoking anti-American sentiment overseas without reducing the danger of terrorism at home.\n\nTwo Democratic senators from Illinois, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, requested the investigation.\n\nMany Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have defended the measure as providing a necessary pause to \"make sure that the vetting standards are up to snuff so we can guarantee the safety and security of our country.\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Del Quentin Wilber", "type": "article"}
