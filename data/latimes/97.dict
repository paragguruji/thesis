But both sides are expected to appeal the 9th Circuit decision to the high court.\n\nFortunately for Trump, the law on immigration and related matters favors the president. Legal precedents have traditionally accorded the chief executive complete and nearly unchecked power to deny foreigners permission to enter the United States.\n\nWin McNamee / Getty Images A woman traveling on a flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia wipes away a tear after greeting a relative in the international arrivals area of Dulles International airport on Feb. 6, 2017.

And lest there be doubt, Congress adopted a provision in 1952 saying the president \u201cmay by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens and any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants\u201d whenever he thinks it \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nTypically, legal experts say, the president would almost certainly win a legal fight involving national security and foreign citizens entering the country.\n\nBut the rollout of this executive order has been far from the norm. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to impose a Muslim ban, his recent tweets attacking the GOP-appointed judge who ruled against him and the White House\u2019s clumsy handling of the order\u2019s implementation may change the calculation.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system,\u201d he tweeted Sunday.\n\nJack Goldsmith, a national security lawyer in the Bush administration and professor at Harvard Law School, predicted Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cwill certainly backfire\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cThe tweets will make it very, very hard for courts in the short term to read immigration and constitutional law, as they normally would, with significant deference to the president\u2019s broad delegated powers from Congress and to the president\u2019s broad discretion in foreign relations,\u201d Goldsmith wrote Monday on the Lawfare blog.\n\nTemple University law professor Peter Spiro agreed the court may look differently at the case. The \u201cpath of least resistance would be for the Supreme Court to steer clear of the controversy for now. It could simply refuse to hear an emergency appeal from a 9th Circuit ruling in the case,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cEven though the Supreme Court has been extremely deferential to presidential decision-making relating to immigration in the past, I don\u2019t think they will be here.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have argued that the travel ban does not target Muslims, as critics of the order have claimed. But Trump\u2019s campaign call in 2015 for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d may factor into how judges now interpret his motives.\n\nThe highly charged dispute also comes at an awkward moment for the eight justices of a high court that often appears divided along political lines.\n\nLast year, in a similar case involving presidential power, the justices split 4 to 4 and could not decide whether a Texas judge had wrongly blocked an executive action by President Obama that would have given temporary relief from deportation and work permits to more than 4 million immigrants living illegally in the country.\n\nLawyers for Texas claimed that allowing those immigrants to stay and work would result in costs and real harm to the state. On that basis, a federal judge handed down a nationwide order blocking Obama\u2019s plan from taking effect, similar to the nationwide restraining order now blocking Trump\u2019s ban.\n\nObama\u2019s lawyers challenged Texas\u2019 standing, emphasizing the president\u2019s customary power over immigration. But in that case, it appeared the four more conservative justices were concerned the president had exceeded his authority while the liberals took the opposite position. As a result of the tie vote, a lower court ruling that blocked Obama\u2019s program remained in effect.\n\nNow, the court may be confronted with similar questions but with the roles reversed: a liberal state challenging the actions of a Republican president.\n\nLawyers for Washington state went to court in Seattle alleging that Trump\u2019s order would cause harm to the state\u2019s universities and reduce sale taxes collected from tourists.\n\nOn that basis, U.S. District Judge James Robart said the state had legal standing to sue the president. He did not, however, spell out why the ban was illegal or unconstitutional. The state\u2019s lawyers had contended the order violated \u201cdue process of law\u201d because it changed the rules without warning for foreign travelers, and they said it discriminated based on religion and national origin.\n\nThe judge also suggested during a Feb. 3 hearing he was not convinced it was needed to protect national security. He told a Justice Department lawyer defending Trump\u2019s action he had to \u201cdetermine if the executive order is rationally based. And rationally based to me implies that to some extent I have to find it grounded in facts as opposed to fiction.\u201d\n\nIf the 9th Circuit turns down the administration\u2019s appeal and refuses to lift the judge\u2019s order, acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco will almost surely turn to the Supreme Court. He argues the state\u2019s claim for standing is flimsy, and that the judge had no authority to \u201csecond-guess the president\u2019s national security judgment.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "David G.
