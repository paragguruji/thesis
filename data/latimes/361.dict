But when his film \u201cApricot Groves\u201d had its U.S. premiere during the festival that ran through Tuesday at the TCL Chinese Theatre, he was back in Iran, unable to take in the applause.\n\nHeidary Oureh is one of a number of foreign-born filmmakers affected by the chill that\u2019s set in after Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barred travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 reduced to six on Monday in a revised executive order that still includes Iran.\n\nLast month, Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khateeb, of the short documentary \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d was refused entry into the United States to celebrate the film\u2019s Oscar win, which was also Netflix\u2019s first Academy Award. This came after Iranian director Asghar Farhadi announced he was boycotting the ceremony where the picture he directed, \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d won the Oscar for foreign film. Actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who starred in \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d also didn\u2019t attend the awards. \u201cTrump\u2019s visa ban for Iranians is racist,\u201d Alidoosti wrote in a statement.\n\n\"We have always said that if we were to be nominated, we would bring Raed Saleh, the head of the White Helmets, who has spoken many times in D.C., and Khaled Khateeb, the young cinematographer who risked his life over and over again, as our guests,\" Joanna Natasegara, producer of \"The White Helmets\" told The Times shortly after the initial travel ban was announced. \"They\u2019ve been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 these people are the bravest humanitarians on the planet, and the idea that they could not be able to come with us and enjoy that success is just abhorrent.\"\n\nUnlike Khateeb, Heidary Oureh was not officially denied entry to the U.S. But in an email interview a few days after his film screened at Outfest Fusion, the filmmaker told the L.A. Times how events after the original executive order affected his plans.\n\n\u201cI was watching the news when I heard about the new law by President Trump and I was utterly shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cAs \u2018The Salesman\u2019 by Asghar Farhadi was in the Oscars, I followed the news concerning his attendance and thought there might be a way for other filmmakers and artists.\u201d\n\nAsghar\u2019s and Alidoosti\u2019s boycott shook his resolve, but it was the action against Khateeb that affected him most.\n\n\u201cAfter I heard [Khateeb], the Syrian filmmaker, had been denied a visa, I stopped trying to get one and lost hope.\u201d\n\nThe new ban, which takes effect March 16, halts travel to the U.S. for 90 days for residents of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The refugee suspension will last 120 days.\n\n\u201cTo get an American visa has always been difficult for Iranians, but banning entry is a kind of disrespect more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are good and bad people in all countries. I think we must pass laws out of respect for the good people.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is an edited conversation with Heidary Oureh about becoming a filmmaker, about the travel ban, about expressions of support for immigrants from Hollywood figures, such as Meryl Streep, and his personal message for President Trump.\n\nHow did you become a filmmaker?\n\nI was born in Tehran in 1984. After high school, I left Iran to continue my studies in Cyprus and the UAE and then worked on projects in Turkey and Iran to gain filmmaking experience. I traveled to many countries, mostly to Armenia because it is near Iran and does not require a visa [for] Iranians. Although Iran has always been my first home, Armenia has been my second home in the past few years. I have had only an Iranian passport.\n\nAt what point did you find out that your film was going to be screened at Outfest Fusion?\n\nAfter sending the film to international festivals, we received the good news our film was chosen in Outfest Fusion. I was doubly happy when I heard it because my first short film had been chosen in Woodstock in New York and my cinema profession had started there in the U.S. in 2012. I had gotten a U.S. visa easily back then.\n\nIf you could say something to President Trump directly, what would you say?\n\nMr. President, I neither hate nor like you because I have not met you yet, and I know you have your own reasons for this law. What is clear, however, is that there are always good things in bad events. The good point about this law was that the kindness and love and altruism of the American people was proven to the world, and you created a support and bond between the people of the countries you banned from entering the U.S. and the American people.\n\nCreation of that bond might have taken years by other methods. I read something interesting in the book \u201cFlashes of Wisdom\u201d by the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, which I will never forget: \u201cIt is easy to rule through fear, but it takes a rare leader to rule through love.\u201d\n\nWhat has the support of Outfest Fusion and expressions from Hollywood stars like Meryl Streep about the important role of foreign filmmakers meant to you?\n\nI would like to thank Outfest Fusion for choosing my film. Despite the difficulties I have faced since the start of shooting in Armenia because of the film\u2019s LGBT theme, its presence in [the] festival encouraged me greatly. I thank all American artists who support their colleagues in the banned countries, and I kiss the hand of adorable Meryl Streep for all her support.\n\nTimes staff writers Libby Hill and Amy Kaufman contributed to this report.\n\nCAPTION L.A.
