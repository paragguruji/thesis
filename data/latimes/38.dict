People with visas and green cards found themselves detained or facing deportation and attorneys camped out at airports to provide free legal counsel.\n\nAlmost five months later, the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmation of parts of the ban involving six countries probably will have a different impact.\n\nAlthough activists and Muslim leaders are bracing themselves for some problems and are already mobilizing protesters, the early reaction has been subdued as they and immigrant rights advocates try to make sense of the high court\u2019s ruling, which will be implemented starting Thursday morning.\n\nA few hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for parts of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect pending the justice\u2019s consideration in the fall, the Los Angeles area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations took steps to spread the word about the decision.\n\nIts offices were supposed to be closed Monday in commemoration of Eid al-Fitr on Sunday \u2014 the Muslim holiday that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Instead, CAIR sent an email blast with a fact sheet on what the travel ban means to the thousands of Muslims they serve in Southern California.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a Muslim ban like this that\u2019s targeting Middle Eastern and South Asian communities, it\u2019s going to have a high impact in Southern California,\u201d said Masih Fouladi, CAIR-LA advocacy manager. \u201cA lot of refugees settled down here. It\u2019s going to disproportionately impact the L.A. community.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s bracing for an uptick of hate crime incidents, which he said tends to happen after anti-Muslim remarks or policies take place.\n\n\u201cThat brings a lot of fear into the community,\u201d he said.\n\nChristopher Lapinig, a registered legal services attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles, said there will be a contingent of attorneys at Los Angeles International Airport and others throughout the nation who will remain vigilant on how the narrowed travel ban will be implemented by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nThe ban will still not apply to any foreigners who have a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the U.S., such as relative, a university or employer.\n\n\u201cBut we are concerned on exactly how this standard will be implemented by CBP officers and other Department of Homeland Security officials at airports and other ports of entry around the country,\u201d said Lapinig, who was part of a group of attorneys who gathered at LAX after the first travel ban. \u201cThe idea of testing who has a bona fide relationship with people in the U.S., it\u2019s something that leaves a lot of room for discretion in terms of interpretation. We\u2019re worried about inconsistencies in the way it is going to be applied.\u201d\n\nReshma Shamasunder, a deputy director for National Immigration Law Center in L.A., said her group and others will monitor the situation and expect protests to take place regardless of how the ban is implemented.\n\n\u201cWe remain concerned over any bans at all. It\u2019s discriminatory and unconstitutional and contrary to our fundamental values of fairness and equality,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are absolutely going to be watching.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
