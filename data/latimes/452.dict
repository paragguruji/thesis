Armenians, Iranians, Filipinos and other Latinos moved in.\n\nThe nearby Ralphs eventually became Super King, a vast Armenian grocery that draws people of every ethnicity.\n\nAngel Nu\u00f1ez, 67, shops there with pleasure, loving the low prices. Navigating the midday crowds Monday, he picks up taro root, garbanzo beans, macaroni, bleach and a flier for the week\u2019s specials.\n\nNu\u00f1ez evolved with the city, now counting among his closest friends men from El Salvador and Armenia and a woman of Filipino and Chinese descent \u2014 all Americans, all Angelenos.\n\nSo when he heard the news over the weekend of President Trump\u2019s travel ban on immigrants from seven countries, it hit more personally than it might have in the past.\n\n\"This one, it's an outrage. It's gone overboard,\" he says. \"This is not Cuba, this is not North Korea\u2026. I hope this nightmare is going to be over soon.\"\n\nMarcus Yam / Los Angeles Times Angel Nunez has evolved with the city, now counting among his closest friends men from El Salvador and Armenia and a woman of Filipino and Chinese descent.

Only about a quarter of the population is U.S.-born, non-Hispanic white.\n\nWhether or not Angelenos regularly socialize with people of different ethnic backgrounds, they interact with other cultures constantly.\n\nBecause Southern California brims with immigrants who bring along their native foods, art, music and customs, most residents have a deeper experience of \u201call forms of difference,\u201d says Don Waldie, a Lakewood-based author who has devoted much of his life to thinking about and explaining Los Angeles.\n\nAl Seib / Los Angeles Times Commuters pass through Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.

(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSure, he still meets people who rail against all manner of immigration, he says. \u201cBut they have no problem with their Korean dry cleaner, or the Cambodian serving them food.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid,\u201d he says, \u201cof an abstraction they read about on Breitbart or listen to on the radio \u2014 the shadowy \u2018other\u2019 beyond the boundary of their community.\u201d\n\nWilliam Deverell, history professor at USC, points out that Los Angeles has had plenty of anti-immigrant backlashes in its history, mostly during downturns in the economy. But the polyglot nature of the city, and the \u201cnotion of personal liberty and autonomy in the west,\u201d leads to a certain level of respect for each other\u2019s differences, he says.\n\nTony Sousa, an American citizen who emigrated from Portugal in 1974, says he is conservative and strongly against illegal immigration. But, he adds, he does not pre-judge anyone based on their ethnicity.\n\nTaking his daily walk around his mostly Indian neighborhood in Artesia on Monday, he stops to chat, in a perfect Mexican dialect, with a gardener he knows, then continues into the heart of Little India, taking in the rare white mountain views in the distance.\n\n\u201cThis travel ban is not right,\u201d says Sousa, 69. \u201cIf you have your papers you should be able to come in no matter where you\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nA couple of blocks away, at the Black Tie Affair tattoo parlor, Arlene Escalante, 29, waits for the numbing cream to kick in in her arm before she gets inked.\n\nEscalante says her Mexican-born parents have green cards but canceled a trip to visit their family in Jalisco because they feared they might not be let back into the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe donate clothes in Tijuana. They cross the border all the time. Now they're scared. It just feels like the country is moving backward,\u201d she said.\n\nEscalante said she feels like Trump is stoking and then exploiting people\u2019s fears of terrorism, and she is scared that this order is only the beginning.\n\nNiles Resch, 28, an apprenticed tattoo artist, agrees. He says terrorism is not even on his list of potential dangers he is concerned about. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand what this is about. It frightens me. There\u2019s this concerted effort to isolate us by our different ideologies.\u201d\n\nIn East Hollywood, at Kaiser Permanente, David Earl Waterman, 52, is enjoying his lunch break at a cafe where employees have placed stars on a giant world map to point out their places of origin. The stars glitter on every continent \u2014 all but filling Iran and Mexico and spilling out to the Philippines.\n\nLuis Sinco / Los Angeles Times David Waterman crisscrosses Los Angeles for his work.

(Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAs a job coach who works with intellectually disabled adults, Waterman crisscrosses Los Angeles, and he recently began driving for Uber to pick up extra cash.\n\nDiversity is simply his reality, he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a white guy who lives in Pacoima, surrounded primarily by South American and Mexican residents, and my landlord is a woman from Thailand,\u201d Waterman says. \u201cYou either grow or you go.\u2026 There\u2019s no getting away from it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he hasn\u2019t had his own short-lived \u201chiccups\u201d of negative thought about immigrants, or that he hasn\u2019t talked to other white men who complain about immigrants, saying, for instance, that they get benefits others can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOver my 20 years in Los Angeles, it seems to me that those white men are becoming extinct. I\u2019m having fewer and fewer of those conversations.\u201d\n\nTrump, who campaigned on restricting immigration, received only 22% of the vote in Los Angeles County. Yet he won the electoral college vote and the election \u2014 a fact that Waterman thinks could owe, in part, to the relative lack of ethnic diversity in some of the places where he did well.\n\nAt a nearby table, Ida York, 32, says she gives Trump credit for following through on campaign promises, and for shaking up Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is fresh.\u2026 Someone\u2019s doing something new,\u201d she says as she wraps up her lunch and prepares to head back to her job in the hospital\u2019s clerical department. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s for the better.\u201d\n\nStill, she doesn\u2019t think the executive order limiting immigration is fair. \u201cEveryone wants to come to the United States because we\u2019re a good country,\u201d says York, who is black and grew up in South L.A. and now lives in Culver City.\n\nAt the branch library in Echo Park, Yesenia Tijerino, 40, huddles in a corner of the library with two of her students Monday, helping them prepare for a cosmetology exam in Spanish.\n\nTijerino, who emigrated from Costa Rica at 16, says she teaches students from across the globe \u2014 Honduras, India, Iran.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Joe Mozingo, Victoria Kim, Matt Stevens", "type": "article"}
