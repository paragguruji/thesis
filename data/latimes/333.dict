{"title": "This visa-holding, pop culture-loving Muslim college kid is who Trump's travel ban is keeping out", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-extreme-vetting-abdallah-20170131-story.html", "text": "Abdullah missed Metallica by two days when he left for Amman, Jordan, to get his student visa renewed.\n\nMy nephew, or at least that\u2019s what I call the 19-year-old son of my cousin, debated before he left California in December about whether to stay the extra couple days in Los Angeles to see his favorite metal band.\n\nGo, I told him. Take care of the visa and we\u2019d figure out a way to see Metallica when he returned for the new semester in February.\n\nThat promise became far more complicated after President Trump signed an executive order on Friday that bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \u2014 even if they\u2019ve already been vetted and have a valid visa, as Abdullah has. For how long is anyone\u2019s guess as the details of this order seem to change by the hour and source. Is it 30 days? Ninety? Is it 120? Indefinitely?\n\nIf the Cheesecake Factory-loving, Converse-wearing, Marvel-movie aficionado Abdullah is a fanatic of anything, it's American pop culture.\n\n\u201cI have all my papers in order, and I got the visa, so I should be fine,\u201d Abdullah first texted from Amman on Saturday, where his parents and siblings live. But that was before he started seeing news stories surfacing online of green card and visa holders from the countries on Trump\u2019s list \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan \u2014 being detained and possibly deported from airports across the U.S.\n\nAbdullah may have an Iraqi passport, but he barely remembers the place where he was born, where his parents, grandparents and extended family had always called home up until the U.S. invaded Baghdad in 2003 and it became so dangerously destabilized they had to flee. They\u2019ve lived in Jordan ever since, where Abdullah became a classic rock buff, took up the drums, studied some engineering, learned English complete with American slang (\u201cDude!\u201d), and got hooked on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did everything we were supposed to do,\u201d Abdullah\u2019s mom, my cousin Zaniab, texted me on Saturday morning. He didn\u2019t overstay his visa. \u201cWe should be OK, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nOne of the last things Abdullah did with my family before he left for Jordan was attend \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d production at the Glendale Centre Theatre. When my mom leaned over to explain it was based on the book by Charles Dickens, Abdullah nodded in recognition and said, \u201cYeah, I love the Ghost of Christmas Present, but Jacob Marley kinda freaks me out.\u201d\n\nThe executive order likely blocking Abdullah\u2019s return is, according to Trump, about protecting the U.S. from foreign threats \u2014 despite the fact that none of the terror attacks on U.S. soil has been perpetrated by nationals from those countries, let alone anyone who came here as a refugee.\n\nAnd if the Cheesecake Factory-loving, Converse-wearing, Marvel-movie aficionado Abdullah is a fanatic of anything, it\u2019s American pop culture.\n\nWe went to Coachella together last year. It was the first music festival, and one of the first concerts, he\u2019d ever attended. He sang every lyric to every Guns N Roses song, though almost all were written before he was born. He danced to Major Lazer. He bought a vinyl LP because it\u2019s \u201cold school.\u201d\n\nKatie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times Lorraine Ali helps Abdullah pick out a Guns N' Roses T-shirt at the 2016 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

(Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times)\n\nTrump, who played \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d before his victory speech on election night and at his Lincoln Memorial inauguration concert, would surely find common ground with Abdullah there. He\u2019s perhaps one of the only millennials around who finds the Rolling Stone\u2019s lyrics subversive.\n\nCall it a Muslim ban or an executive order \u2014 either way Trump\u2019s travel restrictions have at least temporarily severed a kid\u2019s dream of studying in the U.S. and seeing Metallica or the Rolling Stones.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a news conference Monday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see the big problem\u201d with the ban, and that immigrants detained at U.S. airports since the order were \u201conly inconvenienced for a few hours.\u201d What he left out were the refugees they\u2019ve barred indefinitely, future immigrants who were in the process of obtaining a visa after years of vetting and those who already live here \u2014 legally \u2014 who are waiting outside the U.S. to see when they can return to their families, homes, work, schools, life.\n\nHe was an American because America was made up of people like him \u2014 the most ambitious or persecuted or hopeful from their respective countries.\n\nIn Abdullah\u2019s Los Angeles apartment, which he shares with other foreign students from countries that aren\u2019t banned, his room is full of his college-dude stuff: rickety IKEA furniture, too many pairs of sneakers, ramen packets, a lumpy futon and a way-too-big flat-screen TV propped against the floor and the wall.\n\nIt all seems suspended in a state of limbo now. But as an Iraqi, he should be used to this. When millions fled following the U.S. invasion and the chaos that followed, they went to places like Syria and Jordan to wait out the war. When it became clear that Iraq was increasingly unlivable, they applied for asylum or immigrant visas to the U.S. and Europe. And they waited some more...\n\nOut of my 35 first cousins and their kids, only two \u2014 including Abdullah \u2014 made it to the U.S. over the last decade. The other relative, a cousin who was a geologist in Iraq, returned to Jordan after waiting in the U.S. for over a year, away from her family, because the resident visa process dragged on so long she ran out of funds and patience.\n\nAbdullah was really our first U.S. success story since the war. He applied for the student visa, waited it out, then worked hard when he got here to maintain a high grade-point average.\n\nHe belongs here, just like my dad before him.\n\nMy father was the only other Ali to arrive in this country on a student visa, and make a life here. He left Baghdad University for USC in the 1950s, met my mom at a college hangout near downtown, built a business up from the ground and raised three American kids. He had a dune buggy. He drank Tab. He loved Roberta Flack.\n\nHe was an American because America was made up of people like him \u2014 the most ambitious or persecuted or hopeful (maybe all three) from their respective countries.\n\nI spoke to Abdullah on Monday, after he\u2019d watched and read about a weekend of protests at airports across America: \u201cI can\u2019t believe people are sticking up for us like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really awesome.\u201d\n\nWe agreed there was nothing to be done for his situation until the confusion cleared. Maybe he\u2019d get back in, maybe he\u2019d have to apply to Canadian or British schools to finish his studies.\n\nBut hell or high water or pointless Muslim ban, I told him that we\u2019d make it to Coachella 2017 together. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be the same without him there, arguing with me about who performed the best set (it was not Guns N\u2019 Roses, Abdullah!).\n\n\u201cI pray to god we make it there!!,\u201d he emailed back. \u201cBut P.S. Nothing beats the GnR reunion \u2014 except maybe Metallica.\u201d\n\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei CAPTION L.A.
