Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green went a step further: On Sunday, they announced they would donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years.\n\nTech executives had been mostly quiet for the first week of Donald Trump's presidency \u2014 but that changed after his controversial executive order restricting refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nWe stand firmly against the actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the value of our community.\n\nThe donation is to help the ACLU \u201cdefend our constitution.\"\n\nThe decision came a day after Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick spoke out against the order. But Lyft appears to be the one reaping the public relations benefits, at least on social media.\n\nUber has taken flak for Kalanick's role on a business panel advising Trump. And the company's decision to advertise via Twitter its continued operations on Saturday at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport amid a taxi strike against the immigration ban was seen by some as undermining the protest. The hashtag #DeleteUber was trending on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nThe two San Francisco-based ride-hailing companies have engaged in a vicious battle for 4 1/2 years for drivers and customers. Uber has a larger market share and war chest. In its fight for new drivers and customers, Lyft has spent millions marketing the ways in which it is different from Uber. Saturday\u2019s events \u2014 and the ensuring #DeleteUber hashtag \u2014 could play into that branding.\n\nIn an email to employees, which was later made public, Kalanick spelled out a plan to assist Uber employees and drivers affected by the travel ban, but his denouncement of the ban took a more conciliatory tone than Lyft's.\n\n\u201cEver since Uber\u2019s founding we\u2019ve had to work with governments and politicians of all political persuasions,\u201d Kalanick wrote. \u201cIn some cases we\u2019ve had to stand and fight to make progress, other times we\u2019ve been able to effect change from within through persuasion and argument\u2026 This is why I agreed in early December to join president Trump\u2019s economic advisory group.\"\n\nKalanick said he would discuss the matter when the panel convenes for its first meeting this week.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Tracey Lien", "type": "article"}
