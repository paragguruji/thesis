Purcell, the Washington state solicitor general, will represent the states of Washington and Minnesota. Those states filed the lawsuit that resulted in a federal district judge's decision in Seattle on Friday to halt Trump's executive order nationwide.\n\nWashington State Atty. Gen.

Souter.\n\nAugust E. Flentje, a career trial attorney in the Department of Justice's civil division, will represent the Trump administration.\n\nIn his 19 years in the department, nearly all in the civil division, Flentje has worked under every president since Bill Clinton. He was part of a team that received an an award from former Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. in 2013 for \"extraordinary work\" in the legal maneuvering around the Obama administration's decision to support same-sex marriage in defiance of the Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress.\n\nIn a 100-plus-page legal brief to the appeals court, the White House was first represented by Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Acting Associate Atty.
