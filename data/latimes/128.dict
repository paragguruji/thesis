Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter both levied criticisms of Trump\u2019s policy, adding to a list of conservatives who saw problems with the new president\u2019s order that stops people from seven countries from entering the United States.\n\nIssa, R-Vista, said the policy\u2019s implementation was rocky, while Hunter, R-Alpine, said Iraqis who helped American forces during the war should receive special consideration to immigrate.\n\nJoe Raedle / Getty Images Rep.

Duncan Hunter (Joe Raedle / Getty Images)\n\nIssa did not say if he supported or disagreed with Trump\u2019s executive order at a phone-in \u201ctown hall\u201d meeting Monday and his office did not respond to follow-up questions.\n\n\n\nHe did, however, express that he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in how the policy was carried out.\n\n\u201cI would hope in the future that there is a lot more care that those fine points are thought out and announced in advance,\u201d said Issa, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee. But he added that there are often hiccups when new policies are first put into place.\n\nOn Friday Trump enacted an executive order that puts a 120-day prohibition on all refugees entering the United States and indefinitely stops Syrian refugees from entering the country. It also blocks for 90 days of visitors from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, and Somalia. He said the restrictions would increase security.\n\nThe policy meant that people from those countries who planned to come to the United States, including refugees who had completed a lengthy background check and security vetting process, were abruptly denied entry. In some cases people were detained at airports or returned to their country of origin, while other people who had come to the U.S. but had made a brief visit to their home country found that they could not return.\n\nTrump defended the way his executive order was implemented.\n\n\u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d Trump said on Twitter Monday.\n\nIn statements and in his telephone meeting with constituents, Issa said the country can welcome immigrants without sacrificing security, and he pushed for an early end to the travel ban.\n\n\u201cI do believe that we need to get the system figured out, vetted and turn it back on as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nHunter, a former Marine Corps artillery officer who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, said he supports a request to Trump from Secretary of Defense James Mattis to exempt Iraqis who assist the American military from the travel ban. Hunter, along with Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who was a pilot in the Air Force and still serves in the Air National Guard, sent a letter to the president requesting that these Iraqis be given special consideration.\n\n\u201cThese allies risked their own lives, as well as the well-being of their families, to advance America\u2019s security interests in a region where their skillsets and willingness to confront extremism have been invaluable to mission success,\u201d they said in the letter.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that, with specific application to individuals who worked with the U.S. Government on the ground, certain immigrants deserving prompt consideration are likely to be overlooked.\u201d\n\nIraqis have worked alongside deployed American service members in a variety of roles, including as interpreters and liaisons with local Iraqis and security forces. Many were vetted before they were hired to work so closely with the military, and now many of the former Iraqi employees are concerned that they or their families will be targeted for assisting the United States.\n\nOn Monday Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer said that people who have helped U.S. forces should be helped out, but they should also be vetted.\n\n\u201cI think we recognize that people who have served this country, we should make sure that in those cases they're helped out. But that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass,\u201d he said.\n\nHunter and other members of Congress who served in the military in Iraq have pushed the State Department to protect these Iraqis by helping them immigrate with their families. Not only would it keep them safe, the veterans say, but allowing them to come to the U.S. tells partners in future campaigns that the country is committed to protecting locals who provide crucial assistance.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Joshua Stewart", "type": "article"}
