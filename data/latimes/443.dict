Gen. Bob Ferguson said in announcing the federal lawsuit. \u201cAnd in the courtroom, it is not the loudest voice that prevails. It\u2019s the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued an order curtailing portions of Trump\u2019s executive order, issued Friday, which temporary halts migration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days and also closed the nation to refugees for at least the next four months. Other challenges are pending.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle was the first taken by a state attorney general, and its provenance was no surprise. Washington state and others along the West Coast voted overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in November and have emerged as a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\n\u201cWe will not yield,\u201d said Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who joined Ferguson at a Seattle news conference. \u201cWe will not be leveraged. We will not be threatened. We will not be intimidated. We will not be bullied by this.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order, which has sparked demonstrations across the country, brought an outpouring of objection from Insley's Democratic colleagues around the country.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s recent executive orders that divide and discriminate do not reflect the values enshrined in the U.S. Constitution or the principles we stand for as Oregonians,\u201d said Gov. Kate Brown.\n\n\u201cA single executive order\u2026 does not define who we are as a country,\u201d said Connecticut Gov. Daniel P. Malloy. \u201cWe are a nation of immigrants and must continue to fight for the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breath free.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, another state that voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker joined the chorus of Democratic criticism, saying the travel ban would undermine the international relations forged by the state\u2019s business, academic and healthcare communities.\n\n\u201cThe confusion for families is real. The unexpected disruption for law-abiding people is real,\u201d Baker said. \u201c\u2026Thankfully, the federal courts will have an opportunity to straighten this out and it is my hope they do so, and do so quickly.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Mark Z.
