It is both wrong and illegal to assume that a person is more likely to be dangerous because of his or her religion, national origin, race or ethnicity. It is irrational to believe that refugees fleeing persecution are a national security threat.\n\nLike the prior executive order, which was announced Jan. 27, the new version issued Monday suspends the entire refugee program for 120 days. It caps the total number of refugees admitted this fiscal year at 50,000 instead of 110,000. It bars immigrants from Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days.\n\nTwo main differences stand out between travel ban 1.0 and 2.0. The first executive order included Iraq on the banned list; the second does not. The first affected those who have the lawful right to be in the United States, such as those with green cards and visas; the second does not.\n\nStill, most of the original legal reasoning against the ban applies.\n\nA three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that version 1.0 was possibly unconstitutional because it was discriminatory in effect: the designated countries are all majority Muslim. There\u2019s also good evidence that the ban was discriminatory in intent: President Trump said repeatedly during his campaign that he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the country. And former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an advisor to President Trump, stated that Trump had asked for his help in \u201clegally\u201d creating a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d and that, in response, Giuliani and others decided to use nationality as a proxy.\n\nThe new order lists exactly the same countries, except for Iraq. That\u2019s nonsensical since the Trump administration has repeatedly said it\u2019s worried about countries \u201ccompromised\u201d by terrorism. If Iraq, home of Islamic State, isn\u2019t compromised, what nation is?\n\nThe administration has not even attempted to demonstrate that existing intensive screening mechanisms are insufficient to protect national security.\n\nMore important, there is no good reason to believe that travelers or refugees from the listed countries pose a special threat to the United States. Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Eastern District of Virginia, in enjoining the earlier travel ban, quoted 10 national security professionals who have served in top government positions and who declared that since the Sept. 11 attacks, \u201cnot a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the order.\u201d The Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 which were mentioned several times in the initial order \u2014 weren\u2019t carried out by citizens of the named countries, either; the attackers were mostly from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit panel similarly stated: \u201cGovernment has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\u201d\n\nIn these heady times, many Republicans don\u2019t trust the judiciary \u2014 or the media. But Trump-controlled agencies have actually backed up these criticisms. Trump\u2019s own Department of Homeland Security has said that an individual\u2019s \u201ccountry of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity.\u201d\n\nAdding absurdity to absurdity, the administration has not even attempted to demonstrate that existing intensive screening mechanisms are insufficient to protect national security. Already, refugees and immigrants are carefully vetted before being allowed in the country.\n\nThere are other serious legal problems with the new travel ban. In 1965, Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that no person can be \u201cdiscriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d Absent a specific authorization by Congress, the president cannot simply decide to exclude Somalis, Iranians and so forth.\n\nTrump supporters have pointed to a 1952 statute that allows the president to \u201csuspend the entry\u201d of \u201cany class of aliens\u201d that he finds are detrimental to the country\u2019s interests. But that statute was superseded by the 1965 law. The 1952 statute, besides, did not authorize religious discrimination, which is blatantly unconstitutional. Although the president clearly isn\u2019t versed in the Bill of Rights, he should at least consider reading the 1st Amendment. It\u2019s just a few lines so a long attention span isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n\n\nFinally, the new order, like the old order, unilaterally reduces the annual level of refugee admissions, cutting it from 110,000 to 50,000. Again, this action is not only inhumane and unjustified, but illegal. The immigration statute does not allow the president to order a mid-year reduction in the level of refugee admissions. No president has attempted this before.\n\nTravel ban 2.0 is slightly better than 1.0; at least it respects those who already have a lawful right to entry. But I expect that courts across the country will recognize that it contains many of the same flaws, and find it unconstitutional.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky is dean and Raymond Pryke Professor of 1st Amendment Law at the UC Irvine School of Law.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
