Gen. Xavier Becerra on Wednesday joined counterparts in 16 other states in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging President Trump\u2019s travel ban as unconstitutional, this time intervening in a Virginia case.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by three Yemeni holders of U.S. visas alleges that when they flew into Washington Dulles International Airport, they were improperly handcuffed and detained and then sent on an airplane to Ethiopia.\n\nThe complaint alleges that plaintiffs Tareq Aqel, Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz were forced to sign papers that they neither read nor understood and consequently were coerced into surrendering their visas.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in our Constitution or laws that grants anyone, including the President of the United States, the power to disregard the Bill of Rights,\u201d Becerra said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cBy detaining people who had a lawful right to be here from entering the United States, denying them legal counsel and cancelling their visas simply because of their religion or national origin, the Trump Administration exceeded its authority and violated the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe said the state Department of Justice is working in California to initiate similar cases.\n\nThe latest filing comes just days after Becerra joined other states in filing an amicus brief in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to support Washington state\u2019s lawsuit alleging the travel ban is unconstitutional.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Patrick McGreevy", "type": "article"}
