By noon, roughly 20 members of the local United Service Workers West, which represents airport workers under the Service Employees International Union, chanted \"No ban, no wall!\" in front of the terminal.\n\nThe employees had initially planned to picket for higher pay and better contact terms, but decided to weigh in on the ban following events this weekend.\n\n\"Our workers were looking around and saying, these people who are being detained, they look like us,\" said USWW communications director Elizabeth Strater, who said most of the union members are people of color.\n\n\"They don't want to see their workplace turned into a detention center.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s sweeping travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries triggered protests at airports across the nation during the weekend.\n\nAt LAX, an undisclosed number of people from countries affected by Trump\u2019s order \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Syria \u2014 had been detained despite having valid visas and green cards.\n\nProtesters rally at LAX\n\nHomeland Security officials later clarified that green card holders from the affected countries would face additional checks when returning from trips abroad, but suggested they would not be denied entry unless a problem arose.\n\nAreej Ali, 33, experienced the additional scrutiny firsthand Monday, when she returned to California from her native Sudan.\n\nAli had boarded a plane in Khartoum on Sunday and was detained after a connecting flight in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where she was nearly sent back to Sudan, said Ali\u2019s sister, Abeer Abdelrahman.\n\nIf not for a letter sent to the airline Ali was traveling on by a lawyer that her family hired Sunday \u2014 a letter that explained Ali was a green card holder and should be cleared for entry \u2014 Ali wouldn't have been released from Saudi Arabia, her family said.\n\nThe missive \u2014 sent on letterhead bearing the name of the family\u2019s attorney\u2019s firm, Hueston Hennigan \u2014 had news releases attached to it stating that the ban did not apply to green card holders.\n\n\u201cWe were desperate as they were threatening to deport her in less than four hours,\u201d said attorney Courtney Black, adding that she had also prepared a habeas petition on Ali\u2019s behalf.\n\nAbdelrahman was waiting for her sister in the arrivals area of the international terminal with other family members Monday. Abdelrahman said her sister was texting her from within LAX that she was being held back for questioning.\n\nAfter about 90 minutes, Ali finally emerged from the terminal and instantly fell into an embrace with her sister, mother and brother-in-law.\n\n\"Never in a million years did I imagine something like this would happen,\" said Ali, a software developer. \"This is home for me.\"\n\nAli said part of her trip to Sudan was to obtain a Sudanese passport as part of the process to gain her U.S. citizenship.\n\n\"We've worked so hard to come here to express ourselves and live as we should as humans,\" she added. \"I felt like in the past three or four days, all my rights had been stripped and everything I've worked for had been taken away in a snap.\"\n\nAttorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and other public interest law groups worked Sunday to file court papers to release those who were held.\n\nJennie Pasquarella, director of immigrant rights for the ACLU of California, said her group had filed habeas petitions on behalf of seven people who were detained at LAX on Saturday. All seven were later released, and of those, two elderly women were held for longer than 24 hours, she said.\n\nThe group filed a complaint on behalf of U.S.-visa holders who were held in detention by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at LAX and were denied access to legal counsel, said Marcus Benigno, communications and media advocacy director at ACLU of Southern California.\n\nThe ACLU was continuing to monitor arrivals at LAX on Monday, he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not over, far from it,\u201d Benigno said. He noted that there are U.S. visa holders stranded abroad and being denied entry back into the country.\n\n\u201cThat is equally wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nImmigration attorneys working at LAX on Sunday estimated that about 20 people were being detained at any given time. A law enforcement source told The Times that 13 people had been detained at Terminal 2 on Saturday night, but each of them held a green card and was eventually released. The source could not provide detention figures for the Tom Bradley International Terminal, the airport\u2019s locus of international travel.\n\nThousands gathered at the airport Sunday, rallying outside terminals, marching through roadways and blocking traffic. Two people arrested for allegedly blocking the roadway were cited and released, airport police said.\n\nFar fewer protesters assembled on Monday, although they included unionized baggage handlers, janitors and customer service agents.\n\nKhamin Khan, 62, who works at LAX as a lobby agent, said an anti-immigrant mood in the country has made her fearful.\n\n\"I'm a citizen and I'm a Muslim, but sometimes I'm afraid of people finding out I'm a Muslim,\" said Khan, who wore her work uniform. She said she's mainly fighting to protect her job but also opposed to Trump's actions.\n\n\"He should be treating people with respect,\" she said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Maya Lau and Brittny Mejia", "type": "article"}
