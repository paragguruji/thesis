At his first meeting that fall with Obama, the president teased Trudeau about his good looks while celebrating their shared commitment to combating climate change and enacting a major Pacific Rim trade deal.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, Vice President Joe Biden said the world would look to Trudeau to play the same kind of role in global leadership that Obama had played.\n\n\u201cThe progress is going to be made but it\u2019s going to take men like you Mr. Prime Minister, who understand it has to fit within the context of a liberal economic order, a liberal international order, where there\u2019s basic rules of the road,\u201d Biden said at a dinner Trudeau hosted for him in the Canadian capital.\n\nTrump and Trudeau will meet privately in the Oval Office and then hold an expanded meeting with other officials from their respective administrations. Later, they will discuss over lunch ways to empower women in the workplace, according to the White House.\n\nThey will close the visit with a news conference before Trudeau heads to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled a planned White House visit amid Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico would ultimately bear the cost of his promised border wall. That visit was intended to focus primarily on another major Trump campaign pledge: renegotiating NAFTA, the more than 2-decade-old trade pact among the U.S., Mexico and Canada.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Michael A.
