Paul Getty Trust, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that the order is ill-advised, unnecessary, and destructive. The Getty stands against it and adds its voice in favor of established American principles of freedom and engagement.\"\n\nFor some, the executive order is personal.\n\nLos Angeles conceptual artist Marjan Vayghan, whose family hails from Iran, had an uncle get caught up in the travel ban when he arrived at LAX on Friday to reunite with his family. Instead, Ali Vayeghan \u2014 who has a green card acquired after more than a decade of paperwork \u2014 was deported back to Iran before a federal judicial stay could take effect.\n\n\u201cWe did not think this would be a big deal,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe\u2019d pick my uncle at LAX, eat, hang out, travel. We didn\u2019t know our entire world would turn upside down.\u201d\n\nVayghan spent much of the weekend protesting at the airport while trying to determine her uncle\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cToday I went for my uncle,\u201d she stated via text message on Saturday. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going back for all the families that haven\u2019t been affected [yet].\u201d\n\nCarolina A.

On Twitter, the band posted the statement: \"In solidarity and love with our Muslim brothers and sisters!\"\n\nWe believe that the order is ill-advised, unnecessary, and destructive. \u2014 James Cuno, J. Paul Getty Trust president\n\nThe Markaz, a Hollywood-based organization that stages literary, musical and other events exploring the culture of a broad swath of largely Muslim nations, from Sudan to Afghanistan to Azerbaijan, dispatched translators to LAX to assist families of travelers who got mired in the ban.\n\nJordan Elgrably, the director of the Markaz, said the executive order on travel is bound to make life more difficult for his organization. Even before the ban, the Markaz cancelled, on average, at least one event a year because performers couldn\u2019t secure visas on time or at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really at the mercy of the Department of Homeland Security and that\u2019s been the case for a long time,\u201d Elgrably said. \u201cWe have a concert on Saturday, Feb. 4, of Moroccan performers [Master Hassan Ben Jaafer & Innov Gnawa]. One is American and the others are Moroccan citizens. Once they get on a plane to go home, we don\u2019t know if they can ever come back.\u201d\n\nCarolina A.

Miranda / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThough Morocco is not one of the seven nations on Trump\u2019s ban list (which includes Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Libya), the ban nonetheless leaves a question mark hanging over future exchanges.\n\nIn early March, the Markaz is hosting an event at Larchmont Village\u2019s Chevalier\u2019s Books to mark the 10th anniversary of the bombing of Baghdad\u2019s Mutanabbi Street, once one of Iraq\u2019s most important literary centers. Elgrably said that all of the participants for the program are in the U.S., so the program is a go. But he is concerned about events moving forward.\n\nThe same goes for larger institutions, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. \u201cWe do have ongoing programs that could be affected,\u201d said Linda Komaroff, who oversees the museum\u2019s Middle East department.\n\nIn April, LACMA is unveiling an exhibition of works by Saudi artist Abdulnasser Gharem. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, isn\u2019t on the ban list, but the political situation could complicate the request for Gharem\u2019s visa.\n\nMoreover, the museum is in the middle of organizing a large exhibition titled \u201cThe Field of Empty Days: The Intersection of Past and Present in Iranian Art,\u201d which is scheduled to open in May 2018.\n\n\u201cIt includes works by a lot of Iranian artists active from the \u201970s to the present day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome live outside of Iran and many continue to live in Iran and we hope that all of them would be able to come to the exhibition.\u201d\n\nCarolina A.

Miranda / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe Farhang Foundation, an L.A.-based cultural organization that promotes the study of Iranian culture \u2014 and helped organize a new exhibition of Iranian video and photography at the Craft and Folk Art Museum \u2014 is facing a similar quandary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned, very concerned,\u201d said executive director Alireza Ardekani. \u201cWe do many projects and exhibitions and film festivals. We\u2019re the sole sponsor of the UCLA celebration of Iranian cinema. As part of this program, we invite filmmakers from Iran to do Q&As and present their films, and based on this ban, none of them will be able to come unless something changes. It\u2019s a huge loss to us and UCLA and to Southern California to not be able to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe net effect of all of this is to cut down on communication at a time when we need it most,\u201d LACMA\u2019s Komaroff said. \u201cWhen your information is entirely restricted to a war-like situation, to acts of terrorism, to what you see on television, you can\u2019t make an informed decision about [a culture]: Are they like me? Are they not like me?", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Carolina A. Miranda, Deborah Vankin", "type": "article"}
