It's seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration, where, frankly, we don't get the information that we need for people coming into this country.\"\n\nIn fact, people from the seven banned countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Libya \u2014 cannot enter the United States under the order. Spicer appeared to be making a renewed effort to distinguish the order from the all-out ban on Muslims entering the country that Trump proposed during the campaign.\n\nMany around the world see the newest policy as an outgrowth of that proposal.\n\nTrump himself conceded a religious connection when he said in an interview on Friday that he wanted to make it easier for Syrian Christians to enter the country. And former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that the order sprang from a group he formed at Trump's request to create a legal framework that would accomplish the campaign goal of a \"Muslim ban.\"\n\nBut amid confusion and worldwide criticism in recent days, the Trump administration has tried to temper some of the more incendiary rhetoric around the proposal.\n\nEven the words \"extreme vetting,\" a favorite Trump slogan, were called into question by Spicer on Tuesday.\n\n\"Calling for tougher vetting [of] individual travelers from seven nations is not extreme,\" he said. \"It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\"\n\nBut changing the ban branding around the program at this point will be difficult.
