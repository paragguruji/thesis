Friedland, referring to claims that the executive order restricting travel from seven countries was a thinly disguised way of banning Muslims from the country.\n\nThe three-judge 9th Circuit panel is hearing arguments on whether to allow Trump's executive order to be implemented. A district court judge in Seattle has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the government from putting the executive order into effect.\n\nAll three of the judges on the panel asked attorney August E. Flentje, representing the federal government, for evidence that people holding valid visas from any of the seven countries had committed terrorist acts in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe president determined there was a real risk,\u201d Flentje said.\n\nJudges again asked if there was any other evidence. \"The proceedings have been moving very fast,\" Flentje said, explaining that so far the record of the case does not include any such evidence.\n\nFriedland quickly shot back that the reason the proceedings were moving quickly was that the administration had filed an emergency appeal rather than allow the district court to hold a full hearing.\n\n\u201cAre you arguing then that the president\u2019s decision in that regard is unreviewable?\u201d Friedland asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the government attorney responded.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "David Lauter", "type": "article"}
