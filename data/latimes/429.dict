Jim Costa (D-Fresno) appealed to President Trump on the House floor Wednesday to reconsider his new immigration ban, which is preventing a 12-year-old girl from joining her family in Costa's district.\n\nAhmed Ali, a U.S. citizen and resident of Los Banos, had been working with immigration officials for years to bring his daughter, Eman, to California. The pair were flying from Yemen to the U.S. when Eman was prevented from boarding a plane during a layover at a Djibouti airport because of her visa.\n\n\"President Trump\u2019s executive order is preventing this legal process from taking place, and is putting Eman and her father in harm\u2019s way while they wait in Djibouti,\" Costa said. \"In the past 48 hours, the Trump administration has been defending the executive order, saying it is not a travel ban or a ban on refugees. So I would like to ask the president, how is the executive order not a ban on refugees and on individuals who have been approved to enter the United States? And how is keeping a 12-year-old girl out of the United States making Americans safer?\"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Sarah D. Wire", "type": "article"}
