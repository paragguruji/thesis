But the survey was based on responses of only 58 corporate travel managers.\n\nEarly indications of an immediate impact are mixed.\n\nAt Yellowstone National Park, Rick Hoeninghausen, director of sales and marketing for park concessionaire Xanterra, said he was unaware of any post-Trump downturn in international bookings.\n\nBerkeley-based Wilderness Travel said its cultural trips to Iran, scheduled for April and May, have been cancelled because Iran has responded to Trump\u2019s executive order by canceling visas to American travelers.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this unfortunate situation will be resolved, and look forward to an end to the travel restrictions on both sides,\u201d said Barbara Banks, a spokeswoman for the company.\n\nThe leader of an inbound international tour operator said her business has increased since Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up in the double digits over the same time last year,\u201d said Noel Irwin Hentschel, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Americantours International. \u201cAmerica\u2019s in a good position now for inbound tourism.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writer Christopher Reynolds contributed to this report.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
