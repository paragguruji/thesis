The losing party can then appeal the decision directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or to an \u201cen banc\u201d panel, which in the 9th Circuit includes the chief judge and 10 randomly selected judges.\n\nHawaii\u2019s request followed a decision by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of a similar hold \u201cen banc\u201d instead of before three judges.\n\nThe 4th Circuit plans to consider Trump\u2019s order temporarily barring travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations on May 8.\n\nThe 9th Circuit has scheduled a hearing on the Hawaii case for May 15 in Seattle.\n\nThe appeals court is considering a ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii barring nationwide enforcement of Trump\u2019s revised executive order, which also halted resettlement of refugees for 120 days. The judge found Trump\u2019s order was motivated by prejudice against Muslims.\n\nTrump initially issued a broader travel ban, but the 9th Circuit struck it down. The revised order now being considered does not affect holders of green cards or visas.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-30", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
