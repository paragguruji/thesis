The poll, conducted Feb. 2-4 surveyed nearly 2,000 registered voters.\n\nBy contrast, a recent Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of those surveyed oppose the block on travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries and 60% don't like the ban on refugees.\n\nMSNBC repeatedly pushes Elizabeth Warren to call Mitch McConnell \u2018Sexist\u2019 (Daily Caller)\n\nAfter the Massachusetts senator was silenced on the Senate floor Tuesday when she tried to read a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, two of her male colleagues went on to read the letter without obstruction. Warren went live on MSNBC, where the Daily Caller insists she was prompted to call Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a \"sexist.\"\n\n\"MSNBC's handling of the McConnell-Warren snafu is downright nauseating,\" said the headline on the Daily Caller's home page.\n\nThe Daily Caller posted video of her Senate floor speech, and the subsequent interview with MSNBC.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same game: Donald Trump and the Atlanta Falcons (American Spectator)\n\nIn this semi-critical piece, Trump is urged not to make the same mistake as the Atlanta Falcons did in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl: Don't become complacent with the playbook.\n\nAfter the Falcons got out to a commanding lead, they did not adjust their strategy enough to stave off the New England Patriots, who stormed back in the fourth quarter and won, 34-28, in overtime to cap the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe author of this piece, Ross Kaminsky, insists that Trump must avoid what would be a critical mistake: expecting that previously successful tactics that got him to the presidency are the same ones that will make a success of his presidency.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has assailed the federal judge who blocked his immigration ban as a \"so-called\" judge and has been critical of foreign leaders, such as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\n\u201cWhat he seems not to have understood is that once winning election, the target audience for his messages immediately expanded, whether he wanted it to or not, to include members of Congress, foreign leaders, and corporations,\u201d Kaminsky writes. \u201cJust because Mr. Trump and his supporters would prefer not to consider this new audience doesn\u2019t mean he can, or will, get away with ignoring or antagonizing it.\u201d\n\nThe judge 'began throwing pinpoint passes' (Fox News)\n\nAlso, on Fox News, Robert Charles, a former secretary of State under George W. Bush, used the Super Bowl to make a point, painting the 9th Circuit Court hearing as a back-and-forth battle of titans -- providing sideline commentary along the way.\n\n\"Could a Ninth Circuit panel, split two-to-one activist judges, actually issue a stay \u2013 permitting the President\u2019s Order to stand, at least for now? Might [Judge Richard] Clifton\u2019s questions convert someone, one of the two? Not likely, but stranger things have happened,\" he wrote.\n\nCharles seemed particularly impressed when Clifton noted it might be hard to infer religious animus against Muslims when most Muslims around the world wouldn't be affected by the travel ban. \"Bingo!\" he wrote . \"Touchdown! \"", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
