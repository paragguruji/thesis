Bush\u2019s administration and helped write a memo justifying torture of terrorism suspects, said the Supreme Court is unlikely to agree to review the decision.\n\nThe inclusion of green-card holders in the travel ban doomed it legally, Yoo said, and the Supreme Court rarely agrees to hear such emergency appeals in any case.\n\nYoo said the 9th Circuit was on less solid ground on other issues: whether the states had standing to sue and whether visa holders had a right to a hearing before their visas were canceled.\n\nThe administration lost because \u201cit rushed out this order in an ill-considered and haphazard way,\u201d the legal scholar said. A \u201cmore cautious, more modest\u201d executive order would have survived legal scrutiny, he said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
