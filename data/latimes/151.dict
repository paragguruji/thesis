And Trump is likely to be asked about it at a news conference with Abe after their meeting.\n\nAbe will be the second of four world leaders visiting Trump in his first month in office, an unusual blitz of high-level meetings this early in a presidency. British Prime Minister Theresa May came to Washington two weeks ago, and the leaders of Canada and Israel are expected next week.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan are two of the world's largest consumer markets, and Trump and Abe are expected to discuss ways to cooperate on economic issues and to negotiate trade deals directly.\n\nJapan's economy took a hit when Trump announced he was dropping the complex Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that Tokyo favored.\n\nTrump has unsettled a careful balance of competing of U.S. interests in Asia. Shortly after he was elected, he undermined longstanding U.S. policy toward China by speaking directly with Taiwan's leader before his inauguration, thrusting into doubt the U.S. commitment to the so-called \"one China\" policy.\n\nJapan has concerns about China's rising influence in the Pacific and Beijing's military buildup in the South China Sea. The U.S. has about 50,000 troops stationed in Japan, and Abe is expected to seek assurances from Trump that the U.S. will stand up for Japan's presence on the Senkaku Islands, territory that China disputes.\n\nTrump's comments about increasing the U.S. nuclear arms stockpile has also unnerved Asian leaders concerned about a new arms race. Japan has long viewed with worry North Korea's attempts to build a nuclear weapon that could reach its shores.\n\nFollowing their meeting in Trump's office and the news conference, Abe and Trump will fly to Palm Beach, Fla., to spend the weekend at Trump's Mar a Lago resort, where they plan to golf together.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
