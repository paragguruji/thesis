When you isolate yourself from the world you are isolated.\u201d\n\nBut many Muslims, especially those outside the Persian Gulf states, were less enthusiastic.\n\nHussein Salama, a 29-year-old Egyptian aid worker in Cairo, criticized Trump for failing to acknowledge the role Saudi Arabia played, wittingly or not, in the creation of extremist groups such as Al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cThe problem with this approach is that it totally disregards the fact that Saudi Arabia has provided the ideological structure upon which these organizations stand,\u201d Salama said in an interview.\n\nHe accused the United States of \u201cthrowing money at its oil-rich ally and relying on Saudi Arabia to play a role in resolving regional crises without realizing that Saudi Arabia has played a role in creating these crises in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe speech also elicited a condemnation from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which holds sway over the Gaza Strip. In a statement by spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, the Islamist group labeled the speech a \u201cslander against the reputation of the resistance of the [Palestinian] people.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Trump lumped Hamas together with Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Hezbollah as terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cDrive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this Earth,\u201d Trump had exhorted Muslim leaders gathered at the summit.\n\nBarhoum criticized Trump for showing \u201ctotal bias to the Zionist occupation,\u201d in a reference to Israel. He added that Hamas was a \u201cnationalist liberation movement.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s hard line against Iran, which came two days after a landmark election that cemented President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s reformist agenda, was seen by some Iranians as a slap in the face.\n\n\u201cJust when Iranians voted overwhelmingly for openness and engagement with [the] world, Trump clenched his fist and responded by calling for Iran's isolation. It raises the question as to whether the United States wants to lose Iran as an enemy,\u201d said Iranian academic and author Trita Parsi in an email statement Sunday.\n\n\u201cCombining isolation with a call for regime change \u2014 ironically after the Iranians went and massively participated in their presidential elections \u2014 is how the groundwork for the Iraq war was laid,\u201d Parsi cautioned.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, sent out a wry tweet saying that \u201cIran \u2014 fresh from real elections \u2014 [was] attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation\u201d \u2014 a sarcastic reference to Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy whose rulers have forged an uneasy alliance with hard-line clerics who espouse a strict interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nZarif also suggested that Trump\u2019s primary interest was in arms sales and other deals with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that he valued at $480 billion. It was unclear how Zarif arrived at that figure. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Saudi Arabia has agreed to long-term deals collectively valued at more than $350 billion.\n\nHamid Reza Taraghi, an analyst close to the office of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, viewed Trump\u2019s moves as a way \u201cto sell weapons and [do] business.\u201d\n\nAmir Kavian, a 53-year-old publisher in the Iranian capital, Tehran, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is good for America\u2026. They make a fortune from the catastrophe in the Middle East,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\nHe added that the outcome of the presidential election demonstrated that \u201cIran is ready to compromise.\u201d\n\nIn Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has waged a devastating war against the Houthi rebels who have taken control of the government, thousands took to the streets of the capital, Sana, to protest against Trump\u2019s visit to Riyadh. The president\u2019s speech did little to mollify them.\n\n\u201cThe most disgusting part of the entire speech, Trump praises #Saudi actions in #Yemen. A war KILLED high number of civilians,\u201d tweeted Fares Said, a journalist with the Yemen Al-Yawm newspaper.\n\nThe two-year conflict in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people. The majority of the deaths have been blamed on a Saudi-led air campaign to which the U.S. has provided logistical support and weapons.\n\nLast year, mounting civilian casualties in the country pushed the Obama administration to suspend the sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. Trump reversed the order.\n\nMany in the region were also dismayed by the arms deal that Trump touted in his speech.\n\nJordanian lawyer Gandhi Amin, in a post on his Facebook page titled \u201cWhy I Am Sad,\u201d listed alternative uses for some of the money, such as ending a cholera epidemic sweeping Yemen or creating a refugee center for all Syrians displaced by war.\n\nThe arms deal was also criticized by some American Muslim groups.\n\n\u201cHistorically, arms trade results in more fighting, more wars, and more extremism,\u201d said Salaam Bhatti, a spokesman for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, in a phone interview Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhile we applaud the president for saying that Muslims are the victims of 95% of terrorism, rather than the arms trade, we ask that nations improve education and invest in proven models for peace.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-21", "authors": "Nabih Bulos", "type": "article"}
