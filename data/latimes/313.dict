Gen. Sally Yates on Monday, just hours after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend his controversial executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from certain countries.\n\nYates has \u201cbetrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cIt is time to get serious about protecting our country.\u201d\n\nYates is a career prosecutor who served as the Obama administration\u2019s deputy attorney general. Trump had asked her to stay on as acting attorney general pending the confirmation of his pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.\n\nThe firing came after Yates wrote a letter to Justice Department lawyers in which she said she questioned the lawfulness of Trump\u2019s order and announced that the Justice Department would not defend it in court.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,\u201d Yates wrote.\n\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cConsequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\u201d\n\nThe letter, the defiance of the president\u2019s wishes that it reflected and the subsequent firing created the most public split between the Justice Department and a White House since fall 1973, when President Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, prompting the department\u2019s two top leaders to resign.\n\nTaken together, the actions heightened the already tense atmosphere surrounding the travel ban, which has sparked protests at airports around the country and several court challenges.\n\nIn a tweet Monday evening before he announced her termination, the president portrayed Yates\u2019 statement as part of a partisan move against him, saying \u201cthe Democrats are delaying my Cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced that Trump had appointed Dana J. Boente, the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia, to serve as acting attorney general until Sessions is confirmed. He is a 31-year veteran of the Justice Department, with a background in tax crimes and fraud. In December 2012, he was appointed by former Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to serve as the U.S. attorney in New Orleans.\n\nThe firing is likely not only to heighten the political tension but also create additional problems. To begin with, Yates\u2019 doubts about the legality and wisdom of Trump\u2019s order are now on the public record and almost certain to be cited by lawyers challenging Trump\u2019s action in future cases.\n\nIn addition, Yates was the only person in the department authorized to sign wiretapping warrants in foreign espionage cases involving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nJustice Department lawyers had initially questioned whether someone who had not been confirmed to one of three top Justice Department positions could legally perform that job. They eventually concluded that Boente would qualify.\n\nSessions is likely to be confirmed this week, but Senate Democrats have been trying to slow the process.\n\nThe firing also increased the sense of chaos that already has surrounded the executive order, which Trump signed Friday. The order suspended all refugee resettlements in the U.S. for 120 days, and indefinitely for those from Syria. It also banned travel to the U.S. for 90 days by nationals of seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAlready the administration has had to reverse position on parts of the order, as immigration officials have struggled to understand what it required.\n\nAfter initially detaining scores of U.S. permanent residents on Friday and Saturday, in some cases keeping them in custody for many hours, the administration announced Sunday that in the future, green-card holders from the seven countries covered by the travel ban would not be detained except in unusual circumstances.\n\nThe administration also announced that dual-nationals, people with British and Iraqi passports, for example, would be exempt from the ban after initially saying they would be covered. That question has created tension with European governments.\n\nThe State Department announced Monday that refugees from places other than the seven countries covered by Trump\u2019s ban could still enter the U.S. through Thursday because many were already in transit. About 900 refugees are expected to enter the U.S. this week, the department said in a statement. Earlier, officials had been uncertain about their fate.\n\nIn court hearings so far, Justice Department lawyers have struggled to defend the order or answer questions from judges about the legal issues involved.\n\nOn a conference call with reporters on Monday, Jordan Wells, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which won a preliminary skirmish in court over the weekend, described the crackdown\u2019s impacts as \u201ctopsy-turvy.\u201d\n\nTop White House officials wrote the order without the usual consultation with the major agencies that have to carry it out.\n\nYates was said to be among several top government officials who found out shortly before Trump signed the order or, in some reported cases, when they saw him signing it on television Friday.\n\nYates agonized all weekend, according to a person familiar with her deliberations, debating whether to resign or to direct federal prosecutors not to defend Trump\u2019s order. Eventually, knowing that it would probably cost her the job, she decided to write the letter.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments in an interview Friday that Christians deserved priority for entrance to the U.S. and an account from former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a longtime Trump supporter, about the president asking him and others to draft a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d influenced her decision, the person said.\n\nYates wrote in her letter that comments made by administration officials \u201cmay bear on the order\u2019s purpose\u201d in ways that would undermine its constitutionality.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "David Lauter, Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
