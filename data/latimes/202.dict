Others are imposing travel restrictions on their diverse cadre of employees, even those who are U.S. nationals.\n\nAn executive order, part of a broader set of immigration directives, bars refugee arrivals for 120 days \u2014 indefinitely in the case of Syria \u2014 and suspends travel to the U.S. for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. Trump signed the order on Jan. 27.\n\n\u201cMany of our member organizations would have nationals of these countries working for them and staff working in those countries,\u201d said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president of the humanitarian policy and practice team for InterAction, the largest U.S. alliance of nongovernmental international organizations, with more than 220 members and partners.\n\nThe international nonprofit CARE, which operates in five of the seven countries whose citizens are prohibited from coming to the United States, has banned its U.S.-based staff \u2014 including those who are American citizens \u2014 from traveling to the seven nations. (CARE does not operate in Libya or Iran.)\n\nOfficials of the Atlanta-based group said the move was essential because of the inconsistency with which the order was being carried out, and they did not want to imperil their staff.\n\n\u201cThey potentially could face trouble coming back into the U.S.,\u201d said Nick Osborne, CARE\u2019s vice president of international programs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take the risk of them facing trouble.\u201d\n\nJustin Sullivan / Getty Images Iranian Ali Vayeghan, center, was sent back to Iran after arriving at LAX on the day Trump\u2019s travel ban was implemented.

Now, \u201cthose team members may need to postpone their travel as a result of the order,\u201d Delafield said.\n\nOfficials at Relief International, which has aid programs in six of the seven countries under the ban, faced a similar situation.\n\nThree members of the organization\u2019s U.S.-based staff who are green card holders from Afghanistan, Pakistan and South Africa had trips planned to Iran, Somalia and Vietnam, according to Nancy Wilson, Relief International\u2019s chief executive.\n\nOf those, only Iran and Somalia are on the list of restricted countries. Still, \u201cwe just said don\u2019t go,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWhat if they are outside the country and the list of seven countries gets longer? We just can\u2019t be taking the risk for them to be traveling outside and not be able to get back.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, immigration officials at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia detained two brothers from Yemen, coerced them to relinquish their green cards, and forced them to return to Ethiopia shortly after the executive order banning travel was signed, the Guardian newspaper reported, and it linked to a lawsuit filed on the brothers\u2019 behalf.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the White House said it had issued new guidance that exempts green card holders from the travel restrictions. At a briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that legal permanent residents no longer needed a waiver to enter the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge step backwards for refugees, for our global workforce, and for our relationships beyond this country\u2019s borders. \u2014 A statement from Oxfam\n\nThe order has other possible implications aside from the travel limitations, officials from various aid groups said.\n\nThere is widespread concern that the order could prohibit humanitarian agencies from effectively and safely delivering aid and hinder their ability to quickly respond to future humanitarian emergencies, officials said.\n\n\u201cOur work overseas is very much based on the ability to be able to travel as and when required,\u201d said Osborne of CARE. \u201cIf there is an emergency situation in one of the seven noted countries, that would restrict our ability to deploy our staff. Our ability to deploy technical staff to aid the response is going to be inhibited.\u201d\n\nFor example, there is a growing food crisis in Somalia, where some 5 million people \u2014 approximately 40% of the population \u2014 are suffering from a shortage of food, according to the United Nations World Food Program.\n\nOsborne said the executive order could hamper CARE\u2019s relief efforts in Somalia if the group is unable to dispatch U.S.- based staff to respond to what the agency said could be \u201ca major humanitarian emergency.\u201d\n\nRaymond Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, warned of the possible impact of reciprocal measures in response to Trump\u2019s order. Iran has already canceled future visas for American citizens.\n\nThe order will prevent Oxfam from supporting local organizations that are on the front lines of meeting humanitarian need, the group said in a statement. It will also hinder the relay of \u201ccritical analysis to U.S. policy makers on conditions in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable places directly from the people living and working on the ground,\u201d the group said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step backwards for refugees, for our global workforce, and for our relationships beyond this country\u2019s borders.\u201d\n\nMohamed Abdiwahab / AFP/Getty Images Dead goats are seen in December near Dhahar in northeastern Somalia.

And that\u2019s a lot of stress not just for the individuals but for staff who have worked with them for a long time.\u201d\n\nThere is also concern over how U.S. aid workers might be perceived and treated as they conduct operations in the seven nations subjected to the travel ban. The order might serve to erode confidence in U.S. aid groups, Wilson said. People might begin to question their motives and dependability.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working in these countries and people ask you what\u2019s going on with your government \u2026 and will you really be around to do this work tomorrow?\u201d Wilson said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Ann M.
