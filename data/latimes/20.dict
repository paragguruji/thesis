So far, Trump\u2019s proposed ban has been stalled in federal courts.\n\nThroughout the campaign and into his fledgling administration, conservative media have backed Trump\u2019s calls for a travel ban. The latest attack has only amplified that support.\n\nHere are some of today\u2019s headlines:\n\n16 states ask Supreme Court to revive Trump travel ban (Washington Times)\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban, which bars temporary travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim countries, is headed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is expected to decide in a few weeks whether to hear the government\u2019s appeal of a 4th Circuit ruling against the travel ban.\n\nThis piece, displayed prominently on the Washington Times website much of the morning, notes that Republican officials from more than a dozen states \u2013 all conservative-leaning -- have called on the Supreme Court to allow Trump\u2019s travel ban to be implemented.\n\n\u201cThe states said Mr. Trump has broad powers under the law to decide whom to admit, and said U.S. law is replete with examples of the government singling out groups for different treatment in immigration contexts,\u201d the conservative newspaper reports.\n\nThe states include Texas, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Mississippi.\n\nBreitbart editor fired for anti-Muslim tweets after London attack (Newsweek)\n\nAn editor from this right-wing website seems to have gone too far.\n\nIn the wake of the London attack, as Trump used Twitter to call for a travel ban and assailed London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Breitbart editor Katie McHugh was also on social media.\n\n\u201cThere would be no deadly terror attacks in the U.K. if Muslims didn\u2019t live there. #LondonBridge,\u201d she tweeted over the weekend.\n\nThose comments got her fired. McHugh used Twitter to announce her dismissal on Monday.\n\n\u201cBreitbart News fired me for telling the truth about Islam and Muslim immigration,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nBritain pays the price for complacency (American Spectator)\n\nThe London terrorist attack on Saturday was the third such attack in Britain in a three-month span.\n\nLike Trump, who has questioned the willingness of Britain \u2013 and Europe \u2013 to combat terrorism, this piece argues that complacency has plagued the country.\n\n\u201cSeveral thousand British Muslim men and women joined the ranks of the Islamic State, according to British Muslim MP Khali Mahmood, including the infamous \u2018Jihadi John\u2019 Mohammed Emwazi, who was responsible for the beheading of Western hostages, including journalist James Foley,\u201d writes Peter G. Riddell.\n\nHe adds, \u201cBritish political leadership has let the threat to Britain from radical Islamist extremists drift for a generation. Time will tell whether the British government about to be chosen in the national elections of June 8 will grasp the nettle and take the courageous decisions needed to extricate Britain from its present dire predicament.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "Kurtis Lee", "type": "article"}
