His order aimed to restrict new immigrants and travelers from six majority-Muslim nations.\n\nAll 10 judges in the majority were Democratic appointees. The three Republican appointees dissented.\n\nAlthough the decision was another sweeping defeat for the president and his lawyers, it clears the way for them to take the issue to the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority gives them a better chance of prevailing. The procedural status of the case could allow the high court to hear at least a partial appeal rapidly, perhaps this spring.\n\nIn a statement, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said the administration \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the ruling and would ask the high court to review the case.\n\n\u201cThe President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s decision was the latest in which Trump\u2019s words formed the core of the case against him.\n\nRead the 4th Circuit\u2019s decision to uphold the block on Trump\u2019s travel ban \u00bb\n\nIn issuing the limited travel ban, Trump said the temporary restrictions were needed because of the threat of terrorists arriving from countries including Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The judges in the majority said they did not believe that was true purpose behind the executive order.\n\nTrump\u2019s order \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\u201d Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote. He said the order conflicts with the 1st Amendment\u2019s ban on \u201claws respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation.\u201d\n\nMuch of Gregory\u2019s opinion recited statements from candidate Trump, including his call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d as well as comments since his election that blamed Muslims for the threat of terrorism.\n\nThose \u201cstatements, taken together, provide direct, specific evidence of what motivated\u201d the travel order, Gregory wrote: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s desire to exclude Muslims from the United States.\u201d\n\nThat impermissible motivation tainted both the original version of the order, which Trump issued during his first week in office, and a revised version issued in early March, the court said.\n\nThe three dissenters faulted the majority for ignoring Supreme Court rulings that called for deference to presidential authority over immigration.\n\nJudge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, also derided the majority for \u201cfabricating a new proposition of law\u201d that allows judges to use campaign statements to decide on the president\u2019s actions in office.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds \u2014 one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe was equally scathing in accusing the majority of \u201cradically extending\u201d Supreme Court rulings on the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious freedom in ways that would limit the president\u2019s power over foreign affairs.\n\nOmar Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case, called the decision a victory for the Constitution. Its \u201cprohibition on actions disfavoring or condemning any religion is a fundamental protection for all of us, and we can all be glad that the court today rejected the government\u2019s request to set that principle aside.\u201d\n\nTrump initial travel ban caused chaos at airports around the nation and the world. It disrupted travel for thousands of people who live and work in the United States, including students, professors, tech executives and tourists.\n\nIt was quickly stopped by a federal judge in Seattle and by the 9th Circuit Court.\n\nThe president and his advisors retreated and issued a scaled-back order that applied only to foreigners who lived abroad and had yet to obtain a visa to come to the United States.\n\nThe revised order \u201cdoes not bar entry of lawful permanent residents, dual citizens traveling under a passport issued by a non-banned country, asylees, or refugees already admitted to the United States,\u201d the appeals court noted.\n\nThat could have undercut the lawsuit, but Judge Gregory said at least one of the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d plaintiffs who challenged the order had standing to sue. The man is an Iranian national and a Muslim who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and he hopes to bring his Iranian wife to this country.\n\nThe revised order has run into the same legal problems as before, in part because of public declarations by Trump and White House officials that the new order was a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the original.\n\nIn addition to the judges in Maryland and Virginia who issued rulings against the revised travel order, a judge in Hawaii also blocked enforcement of it. That order is on appeal to the 9th Circuit.\n\nIn late January, when Trump signed his first order, his advisors said the new administration needed a temporary pause of 90 days, time enough to devise new and more extreme vetting procedures for travelers and refugees.\n\nBut little has been done to accomplish this goal. Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting solicitor general, told the appeals court that the nationwide injunction was so broad that officials were barred even from developing new procedures.\n\n\u201cWe put down our pens,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers now could move quickly to the Supreme Court.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "authors": "David G.
