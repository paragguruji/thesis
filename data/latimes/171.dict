Gomez, leader of the largest archdiocese in the nation, said that while he agrees with securing the country\u2019s borders, the order undercuts the importance for real immigration reform.\n\n\u201cThese new orders do not change the fact that our nation needs true and lasting reform of our immigration system,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDo we really want to hand over the fate of millions of fathers, mothers and children to overworked caseworkers in an underfunded immigration court system? A policy of enforcement only \u2014 without reform of the underlying system \u2014 will only lead to a human rights nightmare.\u201d\n\nGomez said the order appeared to have been put together hastily and \u201cnot enough thought seems to have been given to their legality or to explaining their rationale or to considering the practical consequences for millions of people here and across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe urged Trump\u2019s administration to stop deportations of refugees and travelers who are not violent criminals because it would be the \u201cmost constructive and compassionate thing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order blocks all refugees entering the United States for 120 days and indefinitely stops Syrian refugees. It also prohibits for 90 days the issuance of visas to people from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen. All of those nations have predominantly Muslim populations.\n\nComments by Gomez come days after San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy spoke out against the ban in a written statement.\n\n\u201cThis week,\u201d wrote the bishop, head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, \u201cthe Statue of Liberty lowered its torch in a presidential action which repudiates our national heritage and ignores the reality that Our Lord and the Holy Family were themselves Middle Eastern refugees fleeing government oppression.\u201d\n\nMcElroy responded with a statement Sunday evening, noting the United States\u2019 \u201chistoric identity\u201d as a haven for refugees. The president\u2019s executive order, he wrote, is \u201crooted in xenophobia and religious prejudice\u201d instead of a careful consideration of national security.\n\n\u201cThis week is just such a shameful moment of abandonment for the United States,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe San Diego diocese includes roughly 1.3 million Catholics and 98 parishes in San Diego and Imperial counties. The Los Angeles diocese includes about 5 million Catholics and 287 parishes in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
