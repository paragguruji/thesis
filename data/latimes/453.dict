The abrupt move also suspended all refugee arrivals from Syria.\n\nParsi reported that Farhadi has only an Iranian passport does not possess a U.S. \"green card,\" though he could theoretically apply for an artistic exception to the ban.\n\n\u201cThe law is very clear and I\u2019ve heard confirmation that he\u2019s not coming,\u201d Parsi told the Los Angeles Times on Friday night.\n\nAccording to a tweet Saturday from a correspondent for BBC Persian, the filmmaker\u2019s office said there was no \u201clegal obstacle\u201d for him to visit the U.S. for the Oscars, but that Farhadi has not yet decided if he wants to attend.\n\nCalls to representatives for Farhadi, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were not immediately returned.\n\n\u201cThe problem that we\u2019re having right now is that the executive order is so ambiguous,\u201d said Parsi, whose organization is the largest nonprofit of its kind representing the Iranian American community. \u201cThis administration, to be kind, is rather amateurish in how they\u2019re sending out information. We hope that in the next couple of days they clarify exactly what they want these rules to mean and how they should be interpreted, because they cast an extremely wide net.\u201d\n\nTaraneh Alidoosti, the lead actress in \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d announced in the wake of the executive order that she would not attend boycott the Academy Awards. \u201cTrump's visa ban for Iranians is racist,\u201d Alidoosti wrote. \u201cWhether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.\u201d\n\nFarhadi, whose films are not overtly political, won the Academy Award for foreign language film in 2012 for \u201cA Separation.\u201d In an interview with The Times earlier this month, he spoke optimistically about the prospects for change in his country, where he continues to work and reside.\n\n\u201cIn appearance, everything is becoming modern in Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cBuildings and skyscrapers are going up. Old buildings are being torn down. Arthur Miller is staged there. There\u2019s cinema. But once you push that back, you see Iran\u2019s culture and tradition beneath.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writers Jen Yamato and Jeffrey Fleischman contributed.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Chris Barton", "type": "article"}
