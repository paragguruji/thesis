Jeffrey Wall.\n\nHe said there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d the justices would reverse the 4th Circuit\u2019s ruling, and he said Trump\u2019s order should be allowed to go into effect.\n\nThe administration is seeking a fast decision from the high court. The justices usually go on a summer recess at the end of June after having issued their opinions in all the pending cases.\n\nThe travel ban case will probably be handled as an emergency matter by the high court.\n\nNearly all the lower courts that have ruled so far have found that while the president has broad power in the area of immigration, Trump\u2019s order was unconstitutional nonetheless because it amounted to religious discrimination. In doing so, judges cited Trump's own words, including his campaign promise to enact \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nLast week, the 4th Circuit Court, based in Virginia, blocked enforcement of Trump\u2019s order on a 10-3 vote. It \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\u201d wrote Chief Judge Roger Gregory.\n\nThe administration\u2019s lawyers say this decision, and the others like it, were wrong according to both the Constitution and federal immigration laws. They say the Constitution makes clear that federal executives control immigration, while immigration laws say the president may \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d if he thinks they \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe court will consider the scaled-down, second order issued in mid-March. It temporarily suspends entry for nationals from six countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 where the administration sees \u201cheightened risks\u201d of terrorism.\n\nThe ban applies only to foreigners who were outside the United States and did not have a valid visa to travel to this country. It did not apply to lawful permanent residents or foreign nationals who had been admitted to the country.\n\nThe justices are now likely to ask for a quick response from lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union who represent the plaintiffs.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
