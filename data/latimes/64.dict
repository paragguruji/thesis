Travel industry leaders have said they worry that the proposed bans are sending the message that the U.S. doesn\u2019t welcome visitors \u2014 a message that could hurt the nation\u2019s $2.1-trillion travel industry.\n\nBut they might also affect the travel plans of the nation\u2019s newlyweds.\n\nA survey of 400 soon-to-be married couples by an online wedding registry found that 18% say the travel ban has forced them to alter their honeymoon travel plans, and 10% say they are likely to spend less on their trip.\n\nBased on follow-up questions, the wedding registry site Honeyfund found that many couples now worry about traveling abroad because they fear they may have trouble getting back into the U.S. Instead, more couples plan to spend less on the honeymoon and, instead of traveling abroad, will stay closer to home, the survey found.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s travel ban was pretty scary for a lot of people,\u201d said Sara Margulis, chief executive and co-founder of Honeyfund.\n\nShe noted that newlyweds in the U.S. spend about $12 billion a year, with about 40% of all newlyweds traveling abroad and 60% staying in the U.S. for their honeymoon.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
