To survive future court challenges, it probably would have to exclude those who have been living in the country with green cards and visas and focus on those who have never been to the U.S. and might have some link to terrorism, experts said.\n\nWhite House officials already have indicated that a new order would most likely be designed to have no impact on current holders of U.S. visas, meaning that people with green cards or student or work-related visas would be able to travel without additional restrictions.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decided on Feb. 9 to uphold a nationwide block on enforcement of the ban after concluding it was likely to violate the Constitution \u2014 a decision Trump denounced as \u201cvery bad.\u201d\n\nTrump downplayed the chaos that erupted at airports around the world after the ban, as workers, students, people trying to visit families in the U.S. and others with valid visas were denied permission to board planes or turned away after arriving in the U.S.\n\nState Department officials said an estimated 60,000 visas were canceled, but Trump blamed much of the turmoil at U.S. airports on a Delta Airlines computer outage, which occurred after people were already detained at airports and while protests were underway.\n\n\"Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rollout was perfect.\u201d\n\nGiven the plans for the new executive order, Trump administration officials said they would not pursue an appeal of the 9th Circuit\u2019s hold on the current ban.\n\n\u201cRather than continuing this litigation,\u201d the administration said in written arguments, \u201cthe president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.\u201d\n\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s active judges had been expected to vote on whether to reconsider last week\u2019s decision to continue blocking the ban after the close of briefing Thursday. Legal analysts anticipated that a majority of the court\u2019s judges would vote against reconsideration. But in light of the upcoming new executive order, the court said late Thursday that it would pause its proceedings \"pending further order of this court.\"\n\nThe three-judge panel, which consisted of two Democratic appointees and one appointed by a Republican, had refused to lift the nationwide hold on the ban, issued in a case brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota.\n\nThe panel said the ban was likely to violate the due process clause of the 5th Amendment because it restricted travel without notice or a hearing.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Virginia halted enforcement of the ban in that state based on evidence the order was motivated by animus to Muslims in violation of the Constitution\u2019s establishment clause.\n\nThe rulings came amid dozens of court challenges against the administration around the nation since the travel restrictions went into effect. Trump has suffered initial loses in many of them.\n\nWashington state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson, whose office wrote legal arguments against the ban, said Thursday on Twitter that the president was \u201cconceding defeat.\u201d\n\nFerguson, in an interview earlier this week on ABC, also said the state would consider fighting any new executive order.\n\n\"We'll fight if whatever they come up with violates the Constitution and is unlawful, which the current executive order most certainly is,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nUC Berkeley law professor John Yoo, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said a new order could avoid raising concerns of religious bias by focusing on potentially problematic individuals rather than on predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nYoo said Trump could order additional security checks for people whom intelligence agents and law enforcement officials believe are potential threats.\n\nA new order that excluded green card holders and people with visas who already have been to the United States also would be difficult to challenge legally, Yoo said.\n\n\u201cThen the only people harmed by the order would be outside the U.S., and the Supreme Court has said people outside the country don\u2019t have constitutional rights,\u201d said Yoo, who helped write a memo justifying torture for terrorism suspects when he was working in the Bush administration.\n\n\u201cThe class of people who would be harmed are not the people who have legal rights to sue,\u201d he said.\n\nPepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec called the decision to issue a new directive \u201can admission that the first order was drafted with less than ample care.\u201d\n\nFor a new order to survive court challenges, Kmiec said, the administration would have to exclude foreign nationals who are already living and working in the country.\n\n\u201cAnd they would be wise to delete an attempt to give a Christian preference\" for refugees, he said.\n\nThe decision to craft a new order was a \"lesson\" that executive power is \"is not a blank check,\u201d Kmiec added. Trump \u201cdoesn't get to do what he wants,\u201d he said, without court scrutiny.\n\nIn addition to its 9th Circuit filing Thursday, the Trump administration asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to suspend deadlines for arguments in another case challenging the ban pending a new executive order.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "authors": "Maura Dolan, Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
