Lawyers for the administration argued that the judge's decision should be limited to just the two states which had brought the challenge -- Washington and Minnesota.\n\nBut the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in deciding to keep Trump's order on hold, rejected that argument. The judge's order should apply across the country, they said, because the government needs to have a \"uniform immigration law\" in all 50 states.\n\nTo support that part of the ruling, the three-judge 9th Circuit panel cited a decision in 2015 from the 5th Circuit. That court had ruled against an Obama administration program that tried to shield from deportation several hundred thousand parents of young people who had arrived in the U.S. illegally while they were children.\n\nTexas, which successfully sued to block Obama's so-called DAPA program, had argued that its suit should have nationwide effect, and the 5th Circuit had agreed, citing the need for uniformity.\n\nThe Supreme Court, on a 4-4 vote, upheld that ruling in 2016.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "David Lauter", "type": "article"}
