I am also concerned about the order\u2019s impact on the ability of universities to pursue our mission.\u201d\n\nThe abrupt ban ensnared people from all walks of life who were caught in transit or expecting to soon return to the U.S. \u2014 students on a break from studies, business travelers, tourists, even the bereaved who had gone home for a funeral.\n\nA group of advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, on Saturday filed a legal action against the policy in New York, acting on behalf of two Iraqis who were stopped at John F. Kennedy International Airport hours after the order was signed. The writ seeks the release of the two Iraqis, who hold valid U.S. visas, unless the government can show lawful grounds for their detention.\n\nThe groups bringing the action, which also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
