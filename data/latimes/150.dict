Paez is more liberal.\n\nThe panel will decide whether to continue a nationwide hold on Trump's ban on travel and admission of refugees. The judges will hear arguments at 9:30 a.m. May 15 in a hearing that will be carried live on CSPAN.\n\nThe state of Hawaii and a Muslim imam challenged Trump's revised executive order. A federal judge in Hawaii blocked it after concluding the directive was inspired by prejudice against Muslims.\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia is considering a different challenge of Trump's order.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-02", "authors": "Maura Dolan", "type": "article"}
