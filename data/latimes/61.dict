That increases the likelihood that one of the cases will make it to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Justice appealed a Maryland district judge's order against the travel ban to the U.S. 4th District Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.\n\nBoth rulings in Hawaii and Maryland said Trump's executive order discriminated against Muslims. Watson and U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland cited Trump's campaign promises to suspend Muslim travel to the U.S. as proof of his order's anti-Muslim bias.\n\nThe Hawaii ruling is broader than the Maryland one. It blocks a 90-day pause on travel to the U.S. from nationals of six majority-Muslim countries and a 120-day moratorium on new refugee resettlement. The Maryland ruling only halted the ban on travel into the U.S. by citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe 9th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over nine Western states, is the same court where a panel of three judges denied a government request last month to reverse ruling against the first travel ban by a federal judge in Washington state.\n\nTrump, in turn, lambasted the \"bad court\" and signed a new executive order on travel on March 6 that was modified in an attempt to survive court challenges.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
