Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) is skipping President Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday night.\n\n\"These are ceremonial exercises. These are exercises where we honor the president, and people are shaking hands, smiling. It is an occasion where people are basically sending the message that everybody\u2019s working together, everything is going well. I don\u2019t quite see it that way,\u201d Waters said between House votes. \u201cI don\u2019t honor this president. I don\u2019t respect this president. And I\u2019m not joyful in the presence of this president, and so I will not be attending tonight.\u201d\n\nWaters did not attend Trump's inauguration, and said no one who knew her should be surprised that she wasn't going to attend his speech before Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it an awful lot, and I\u2019ve thought about if there are any circumstance under which you would engage in this kind of ceremony. The only thing I could think of was this: If he would apologize to the disabled for mimicking and mocking the disabled journalist, if he would apologize to women for talking about grabbing them in their private parts, if he would apologize for some of the other outrageous actions that he has been involved in, maybe I would,\u201d she said.\n\nWaters said she wasn't encouraging other members to follow her lead and didn't know of other members skipping the speech.\n\nSeveral media outlets, citing unnamed sources, reported that Waters had told Democrats she was skipping because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t control her enthusiasm\u201d in her opposition to Trump.\n\nWaters said that didn't mean she thought she would yell out in the chamber as Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) did when he screamed \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Obama during his first speech to Congress in 2009.\n\n\u201cI would never speak out in the chamber. That\u2019s what Republicans do, not what Democrats do,\u201d she said.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Sarah D. Wire", "type": "article"}
