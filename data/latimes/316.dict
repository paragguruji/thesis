We were supposed to wait a maximum one month,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\n\"Then it was back to zero, like when we first came to Jordan.\"\n\nSince then, he has not been able to find work, he said, because no employer is willing to take a chance on someone liable to leave the country at any moment. The new ban, meanwhile, has only added to his misery.\n\n\u201cNo one knows anything. The embassy hasn\u2019t said anything, and the organizations working for us are waiting for three more months before they know what to do with everyone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of three months. The problem is we still don\u2019t know what happens after, and all our waiting might be for nothing. We have no guarantees that things will return to what they were.\u2026 This could stretch out for years.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Nabih Bulos", "type": "article"}
