The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declined Thursday to overrule that decision. Trump said Friday that he was considering a new executive order limiting immigration, and White House aides said the administration wouldn\u2019t turn to the Supreme Court to defend the current order.\n\nThe study by the market research firm Hopper compared numbers from the final two weeks of the Obama administration with the first two weeks of the Trump administration. Flight searches dropped in 94 of 122 countries in the study, with the notable exception of Russia, where flight searches to the U.S. rose 88% in that period.\n\nTo see if other factors played a role in the drop, Hopper compared flight searches for the same four weeks last year and found searches declined only 1.8% between the two comparable two-week periods, said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist for Hopper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see any other short-term significant events that could be related\u201d to the drop, he said. \u201cIt does seem a pretty strong association.\u201d\n\nBusiness travel bookings in the U.S. dropped 3.4% in the week after the travel ban was enacted compared with the previous week, according to the Global Business Travel Assn., the trade group for the world\u2019s travel managers.\n\nThe group estimates that the drop amounted to a $185-million loss in business travel bookings. Like Hopper, GBTA studied the booking data for the same time last year and found no significant drop.\n\nMichael W. McCormick, executive director and chief operating officer of the GBTA, attributed the decline to confusion and uncertainty among travelers. \u201cThe net effect was that business travel bookings were delayed or canceled,\u201d he said.\n\nTravel executives, including the heads of Uber, Expedia and Airbnb, have condemned the travel ban, calling it discriminatory and bad for the travel industry.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
