The states say Trump's order harms the economy and local residents who are from the listed countries, and also discriminates against Muslims.\n\nThe fight over whether Trump's travel ban should be left in place as lawsuits proceed is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, as is the broader challenge to the order. In the meantime, flights carrying passengers from the banned countries and refugees were landing at U.S. international airports.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nThe Jan. 27 executive order included a 90-day ban on admission of nearly all citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also halted all refugee admissions for 120 days, indefinitely suspended admission of Syrian refugees and said the U.S. would give preference to refugees who are members of religious minorities. Immediately after that, hundreds of refugees, green card holders and visitors with valid visas were either detained at U.S. airports, deported upon landing or not allowed to board flights to the country. The Department of Justice later told a judge that Trump's move had resulted in 100,000 visas that were canceled around the world. The Department of State clarified the number to be less than 60,000.\n\nWho's fighting the president?\n\nThe Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse at the University of Michigan has counted dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration in connection with the executive order. Most were filed by legal permanent residents who were detained, deported or blocked from boarding flights to the the U.S. They were filed in federal district courts in Virginia, Massachusetts, California, the District of Columbia and elsewhere. Several states have also taken the administration to court, saying the immigration order harms their economies and residents. They include Virginia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota and Washington, and they have either joined onto already existing suits or launched their own.\n\nWho\u2019s winning?\n\nFor the most part, it\u2019s not Trump. But all wins have been temporary, and final results could change as lawsuits proceed.\n\nOne of the first legal wins was in a case by the American Civil Liberties Union, which requested an emergency halt to deportations of visa holders and won a stay from a federal judge in Brooklyn the night after the president's order was signed. Another challenge was won that evening in Virginia, where a federal judge issued an order to block deportations of immigrants detained at Dulles International Airport. A Massachusetts judge followed with a similar temporary order Jan. 29. Although civil rights groups viewed many of these as applying nationally, they weren\u2019t followed uniformly.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a major national order came Wednesday when a federal judge said that any immigrant with a valid visa had to be let into the country. The suit, still proceeding, was filed on behalf of 28 Yemenis with visas who had been unable to travel to the U.S.\n\nBut the biggest win for opponents of the order came Friday, when U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle ordered that Trump's ban be lifted nationwide while a suit by the states of Washington and Minnesota was litigated. Notably, Robart\u2019s action applied not only to immigrants with visas but also to refugees. He also ordered a stop to any religious preference on admissions. Robart said he thought the states had a good chance of winning the case.\n\nIn all of the above cases, judges said keeping Trump's order intact would cause \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d a legal bar for immediately suspending it.\n\nWhat is Trump\u2019s case and what are the arguments against him?\n\nThe White House says the president\u2019s order stems from his responsibility to protect national security and is based on a 65-year-old part of the of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nIt says that \u201cwhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, another part of the act says there cannot be discrimination in regard to \u201cthe person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence\u201d when it comes to \u201cthe issuance of an immigrant visa.\u201d\n\nThe arguments against the executive order have been multi-pronged, most alleging a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution, as well as the Constitution\u2019s ban on government religion. The religion argument stems from the order\u2019s preference for admission of religious minorities, and also a TV interview Trump gave in which he said Christians would get preference. Lawyers have also cited Trump associate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said the order was a version of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the country.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
