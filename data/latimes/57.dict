{"title": "Supreme Court may look for a middle ground on Trump's travel ban by shielding only certain travelers", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-courts-trump-travel-20170209-story.html", "text": "If President Trump\u2019s travel ban reaches the Supreme Court, some predict that justices may look for a middle-ground ruling rather than an all-or-nothing decision.\n\nSuch a move could allow the high court \u2013 currently split, 4 to 4, between Republican and Democratic appointees \u2013 to avoid a tie and put off a broader debate on the constitutionality of the ban.\n\nIt would also allow the Trump administration to claim at least a partial victory.\n\nUnder such an approach, justices might decide that Trump's ban could take effect for some travelers, but not others.\n\nSpecifically the court could allow the ban to apply to thousands of foreigners who have obtained U.S. visas but have not yet used them, but not to green card holders, foreign students, doctors, technology company executives and tourists who were already living in the U.S. when the travel restrictions were announced.\n\nSome immigration lawyers say a middle-ground ruling makes sense legally and practically.\n\n\u201cThis would provide a balanced remedy that would relieve the chaos,\u201d said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law at Roger Williams Law School in Rhode Island. \u201cIt would protect the visa holders who are here and want to travel outside the country. It\u2019s unfair to change the rules on them. But it would not apply to people who have never been admitted to this country.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorney August Flentje advocated for such an approach in the final minutes of his argument Tuesday before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel.\n\nHe called the temporary restraining order against the ban \u201cvastly over-broad.\u201d\n\nBut in its decision Thursday night, the three-judge panel unanimously rejected the government\u2019s arguments, including the plea to partially reinstate the ban.\n\nThe judges said courts were ill-equipped to make such distinctions.\n\n\u201c[E]ven if the [temporary restraining order] might be overbroad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the executive order,\u2019\u2019 the panel ruled.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the high court justices take a similar approach.\n\nThe eight Supreme Court justices split 4 to 4 last year in the challenge to President Obama\u2019s immigration order deferring deportation of millions in the country illegally, and they could split again if forced to decide the broad question.\n\nGenerally the court prefers to avoid such outcomes, since it means the lower court ruling \u2014 in this case, the 9th Circuit decision \u2014 remains in effect.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative justices are likely to see merit in the government\u2019s claim that the law calls for deferring to the president on matters of immigration and national security.\n\nThe liberal justices are also likely to agree that Trump\u2019s order was rash, disruptive and unfair to foreign travelers who were traveling legally into and out of this country.\n\nMargulies said justices from both sides may favor a middle-ground approach.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible Justices [Stephen G.] Breyer or [Elena] Kagan might think a modified restraining order makes more sense,\u201d he said.\n\nTemple University law professor Peter Spiro agreed the justices may move toward narrowing the order, noting U.S. law gives more protection to people who are in this country, even if they were foreign citizens.\n\n\u201cThe courts have been generally deferential to the political branches when it comes to immigration, but they have been less deferential when it comes to noncitizens already present in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this makes sense, both politically and legally. Students in the U.S. with visas, for example, could go back to their home countries for vacation and then return to their studies here. From the administration\u2019s perspective, a limited reinstatement would get them much of what it\u2019s looking for: No new visas would be issued to nationals of the listed countries or to refugees.\u201d\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
