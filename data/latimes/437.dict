Meanwhile, another protest was underway in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe vigil comes in response to President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee arrivals and banning travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe abrupt ban ensnared people from all walks of life who were caught in transit or expecting to soon return to the U.S. \u2014 students on a break from studies, business travelers, tourists, even the bereaved who had gone home for a funeral.\n\nThe LAX candlelight vigil is being organized by the Service Employees International Union, and several politicians are expected to attend, including Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. The protest is planned for 5 p.m.\n\nA group of advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a legal action against the policy on Saturday in New York, acting on behalf of two Iraqis who were stopped at John F. Kennedy International Airport hours after the order was signed. The writ seeks the release of the two Iraqis, who hold valid U.S. visas, unless the government can show lawful grounds for their detention.\n\nThe groups bringing the action, which also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
