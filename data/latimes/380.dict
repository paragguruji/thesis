The impact of the \u201cfriendliness of the U.S.\u201d toward foreigners is hard to measure, and to forecast, the report said.\n\n\u201cIt may be that it makes the U.S. a more adventurous place to be, but the increased difficulty of getting visas might just do the opposite,\u201d wrote Jerry Nickelsburg, a UCLA economist.\n\nIn 2015, Mexicans made 7.8 million trips to California, Chinese made 1.1 million visits and Indians made 580,000, said the report, citing data from the Department of Commerce. In total, visitors spent $15.2 billion that year.\n\nOver two years, $1.7 billion isn\u2019t a huge loss to an economy that generates $2.5 trillion a year. But tourism buoys some of the industries that have created the most jobs since the recession ended in California.\n\nLeisure and hospitality \u2014 meaning restaurants and hotels \u2014 will cut 12,000 jobs this year because of the drop in foreign tourists, the forecast predicts. That\u2019s a third of all the jobs that sector created in 2016. Retail could ax 2,300 workers, the report said.\n\nCalifornians will have to get used to slower growth in general over the next three years, UCLA economists predicted. The economy will add new jobs at a rate of 2.1% this year, they said, and the annual growth rate will eventually decline to 0.9% in 2019. That\u2019s down from an average pace of about 2.3% job growth each year since 2012.\n\nThat forecast could become much worse, the report said, if Trump manages to quickly deport millions of workers who entered the U.S. illegally. Such workers make up a significant chunk of the labor force that supplies food in California. USC estimates that 45% of farmworkers in the state are undocumented, for example.\n\nRemoving large groups of those people could easily lead to \u201ca significant reduction in production of food, in food processing, particularly the slaughter and preparation of meat products, in garment manufacturing and in residential construction,\u201d Nickelsburg found.\n\nCAPTION 58 are dead and over 500 injured after a shooting on the Las Vegas strip.
