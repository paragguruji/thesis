{"title": "Essential Politics: Legal fight over suspended travel ban continues today in 'out of control' California", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-20170206-story.html", "text": "President Trump's controversial travel ban was put on hold over the weekend after a federal judge issued a nationwide temporary order that reopened the flow of travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by Washington and Minnesota arguing that the ban amounts to religious discrimination against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the order, saying the judge \"second guessed\" the president on national security, but early Sunday the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the administration\u2019s request to immediately reinstate Trump's travel ban, instead asking both sides to file arguments by Monday.\n\nMaura Dolan explores how the court, which is seated in San Francisco and viewed as the most liberal federal appeals court, will approach the case.\n\nI'm Sarah Wire. Welcome to the Monday edition of Essential Politics.\n\nMichael A. Memoli, Jaweed Kaleem and Lisa Mascaro have the story on what this first challenge to the Trump administration means.\n\nTrump continued to criticize the judge on Twitter on Sunday, saying he and the court system are to blame if something happens.\n\nThe ban drew protests around the world over the weekend, and a new poll found that two-thirds of Californians disapprove of the ban.\n\nIn an interview aired Sunday, Trump declared California to be \"out of control\" and threatened to withhold federal funding to the Golden State if it declares itself a sanctuary state for immigrants.\n\nGet the latest about the Trump transition on Essential Washington and follow @latimespolitics and keep an eye on our Essential Politics news feed\n\nPROTESTS AT CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES\n\nDemonstrations by anti-Trump groups have escalated in the last week in California, Christine Mai-Duc reports, with protesters popping up at the offices of several Republican members of Congress. Many are part of a national network of protesters calling themselves \u201cIndivisible\u201d that is copying tactics from the anti-Obama tea party.\n\nThe situation got so tense at Rep. Tom McClintock's town hall Saturday that the Elk Grove Republican had to be escorted out by police.\n\nHundreds showed up at Rep. Steve Knight's office and handed over hundreds of letters urging him not to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCALIFORNIA'S $368 BILLION IN FEDERAL CASH\n\nAnxiety among Democrats and some activist groups over the president's early actions is high, and talk in California has turned to how much money the state receives from the federal government and what might happen to it.\n\nHow much money is it? A lot. In his Sunday column, John Myers offers a sketch of some $368 billion in federal dollars that flow into the Golden State every year \u2014 and why very little of it could be subject to political punishment by Washington.\n\nWHY CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH AIRBNB\n\nBattles over Airbnb and other short-term rentals are ongoing in city halls across California. But despite their efforts, state lawmakers have failed to pass legislation either to crack down on short-term rentals or make it easier for the industry to operate.\n\nThe reason, Liam Dillon reports: Neither Airbnb nor their opponents, chiefly those in the labor movement, have been able to out-muscle each other politically, nor have legislators figured out how to address sticky tax issues between cities and the state.\n\nTHE HEART OF THE OBAMACARE DEBATE IN CALIFORNIA IS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY\n\nValley residents won't hesitate to tell you they often feel overlooked by California's coastal cities. But the spotlight is now on the region for one of the fiercest political battles brewing in the Trump era: the future of the Affordable Care Act.", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Sarah D.
