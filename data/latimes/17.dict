Watson also vastly expanded the family relations that refugees and visitors can use to get into the country.\n\nThe high court on Wednesday blocked Watson's order as it applies to refugees, but not the expanded list of relatives. The justices said the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco should now consider the appeal. It's not clear how quickly that will happen.\n\nIn the meantime, though, up to 24,000 refugees who already have been assigned to a charity or religious organization in the U.S. will not be able to use that connection to get into the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court also denied the administration's request to clarify the high court's ruling last month that allowed the administration to partially reinstate a 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe court's ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travelers with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or an entity in the U.S. The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.\n\nWatson's order added grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins to a Trump administration list that included a parent, spouse, fiance, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the U.S. The expanded list of relatives remains in effect.\n\nJustices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas would have blocked Watson's order in its entirety. Those same three justices said last month they would have allowed the Trump travel ban to take full effect.\n\nUPDATE\n\n10:49 a.m. This story has been updated with additional details and background on the portion of the high court's order that pertains to exemptions for relatives.\n\nThis article was originally published at 10:15 a.m.\n\n", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "authors": "Associated Press", "type": "article"}
