I have a house in San Jose with all my stuff. I need to be in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all Trump\u2019s campaigning about how his business acumen would boost the economy and help entrepreneurs, company founders such as Eslami were quick to point to the chaos that Friday\u2019s executive order has created for them.\n\nIn Eslami\u2019s case, he has found himself stranded overseas away from his business. The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that green card holders from the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by the order would be able to reenter the country, but the rushed implementation has left many with a sense of uncertainty about whether they will be turned away at the border.\n\nSome companies have postponed business trips for visa-carrying employees. Sports leagues with foreign-born players and global corporations with established American outposts now face a conundrum of what to do with employees whose jobs require them to cross borders.\n\n\u201cI have clients [from the listed countries] who are on investor visas wondering if they can come back to manage their investments, and the answer is no,\u201d said Reaz Jafri, an immigration attorney at Withers Bergman who spent the weekend fielding panicked calls from corporate clients.\n\n\u201cSome of these companies are multinational firms. They can\u2019t bring in people from overseas. They can\u2019t let people in the U.S. leave. It\u2019s going to have an immediate financial effect.\u201d\n\nBusinesses are scrambling to change longstanding plans. In the Bay Area, Alston Ghafourifar and his sister Brienne run Entefy, a tech start-up whose employees include citizens of the affected countries. The firm quickly altered travel plans to account for employees who might not be able to leave the country without risk of their reentry being denied.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t halt our business operations, but it makes it much harder,\u201d said Ghafourifar, whose employees travel to attend tech conferences, meet international investors and visit team members abroad. \u201cIt forces us to re-plan what our next two quarters will look like.\u201d\n\nSome executives, like Husayn Kassai, chief executive of British background check start-up Onfido, find irony in how an administration that pledged on the campaign trail to help create jobs may wind up doing the exact opposite.\n\nKassai, a British and Iranian dual citizen who holds a green card, travels between his firm\u2019s London and San Francisco offices every three weeks for meetings and recruitment. The start-up is growing and plans to hire more U.S. workers, but now he questions whether he should travel at all.\n\nNot being able to meet in person can hinder productivity and relationship building. Recruitment can suffer if executives are absent, Kassai said, and in an already competitive industry where firms are vying for talent, he can\u2019t afford to not be in the room when offers are made.\n\nWhile much of his job can be done over Skype, Kassai said nothing beats in-person communication. \u201cIf I\u2019m there in person, we might be better at persuading [a candidate] to join.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order also rattled the sports business world.\n\nAlthough the order is temporary, several media reports questioned whether it might harm Los Angeles\u2019 bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics were it to continue to affect global athletes\u2019 ability to enter and leave the country.\n\nThere also was speculation that it could impede two players in the National Basketball Assn. who are citizens of South Sudan, which gained its independence in 2011.\n\nThe situation prompted the NBA to seek more clarity from the U.S. State Department so that the league can \u201cunderstand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement.\n\nMany business experts fear that even a 90-day ban could have long-term consequences for the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cIt sends a global message,\u201d said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough School of Business, \u201cthat America is not a good place for doing business.\u201d\n\nAnd brain drain is entirely possible, Cooke said. Engineers, scientists, doctors and researchers may well take their work to countries that are less openly hostile toward immigration.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, long seen as the mecca for software engineers, some foreign-born workers have started to question whether it\u2019s worth jumping over immigration hurdles to stay.\n\nSoroush Pour, a software engineer who is a citizen of Iran and Australia and has lived in the U.S for seven years on a visa, booked a trip to visit Australia in February to attend a wedding. Over the weekend, he was advised by immigration attorneys to avoid traveling outside the U.S.\n\n\u201cI love the company I work for, and I love living in the Bay Area, but it\u2019s hard for me to go through this visa process, and it\u2019ll take years before I have permanent residency, let alone citizenship,\u201d Pour said. \u201cIt makes you wonder if this will ever be home.\u201d\n\nFor Eslami, who remains in Argentina, the U.S. is home. He\u2019s lived here for more than half his life. He wants to get back to his business, to his employees, to his life in the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m just waiting to see how this thing plays out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to judge what will happen.\u201d\n\nLien reported from San Francisco and Etehad and Peltz from Los Angeles.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
