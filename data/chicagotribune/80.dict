It bars the government from transferring the family outside of the Central District of California, which includes much of Southern California.\n\nIt shocks the conscience. These are the people we should be putting out the welcome mat for. \u2014 Talia Inlender, a senior staff attorney with Public Counsel\n\nInlender said the father had been employed by the U.S. government in Afghanistan and he and his family had received special immigration visas, or SIVs.\n\nThe process for obtaining those visas involves intensive vetting, including interviews, security checks, medical examinations and fingerprints \u2014 as well as a finding that the applicant has experienced a serious threat because of his or her work with the U.S. government, according to the petition.\n\n\u201cIt shocks the conscience,\u201d Inlender said in a phone interview with The Times. \u201cThese are the people we should be putting out the welcome mat for. They\u2019re putting their own lives and families at risk, and instead of providing them that welcome mat we are detaining them.\u201d\n\nThe case comes on the heels of President Trump\u2019s controversial and hotly contested executive order temporarily restricting travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 from entering the United States. The Jan. 27 order did not include Afghanistan.\n\nThe travel ban immediately sent airports into chaos, spurred nationwide protests and was challenged in court by multiple civil rights organizations and state attorneys general.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle issued a stay on Trump\u2019s order, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld the stay. Trump has said he plans to release a new executive order, possibly as early as Monday, that would thoroughly vet travelers while addressing safety concerns.\n\nA hearing on the family\u2019s case is set for Monday afternoon.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
