Those people are Muslims and they're not helping.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump wants America first,\u201d he added. \u201cI liked him from the day he took office.\"\n\nThat is decidedly a minority view in Tripoli, Lebanon \u2014 not to be confused with the capital of Libya \u2014 where hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have arrived in recent years, hoping that it will be a springboard to a new life in Europe or the United States.\n\nBilal Hussein / Associated Press Tourists visit the Great Mosque in Tripoli, Lebanon, in 2015.

(Bilal Hussein / Associated Press)\n\nFor most people here, Trump\u2019s indefinite ban on the resettlement of Syrian nationals in America (as opposed to an injunction of at least four months on six other Muslim-majority countries) was further proof that the world has all but abandoned the refugees fleeing civil war.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Friday halting admissions to the U.S. by citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Another order stopped all refugees from entering the country for 120 days, but it banned Syrians indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWhy are we Syrians specifically rejected?\u2026. We're now the worst scum of the Earth? The other six countries get to have their case reviewed, but not us. We\u2019re the worst,\u201d said Abdul Qader Qudr, a 52-year old Syrian former construction contractor from Tartus, a Syrian coast city a scant 40 miles up the Mediterranean coast from Tripoli.\n\n\u201cYes, at least give Syrians a special treatment, but not like this\u2026 not special treatment for the worse.\u201d\n\nQudr, who had applied to emigrate to the U.S. 12 years ago to join his brothers and elderly mother in Los Angeles, had left a job in Saudi Arabia six months earlier to finalize procedures for his immigrant visa in Lebanon.\n\nNow, he said, his \u201cdreams have evaporated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even register with the U.N. so I wouldn\u2019t mess up my case. There's no country that will take us now,\u201d he said. Refugees must register with the U.N. to receive assistance and temporary residency in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cGo risk dying in the sea on a boat, you'll get asylum. But try to go legally and you\u2019ll get rejected every time. The stamps in my passport are like a joke,\u201d he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Syrians, desperate to flee the violence of the six-year civil war ravaging their country, have opted for a risky sea passage between Turkey and Greece en route to refugee-friendly European countries, such as Germany and Sweden. The International Office of Migration recorded almost 4,000 deaths in 2015 for refugees making the Mediterranean crossing.\n\nLarge swaths of Syria have been destroyed in the punishing fight between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad and rebels who reject his rule.\n\nAbout half of the country\u2019s population has been displaced \u2014 some 11 million people \u2014 and of that group, about 4.8 million people have fled to neighboring countries and beyond.\n\nQudr\u2019s sentiment was shared by many waiting for assistance in front of the U.N.\u2019s Tripoli headquarters, located on a muddy street with fearsome potholes covered by the day\u2019s rain. It\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw away from the Rashid Karami International Fairground, a sprawling (and unused) installation designed in the 1960s by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. It stands as a testament to the one-time significance of Tripoli, which has been largely superseded by the capital, Beirut.\n\nIbrahim Chalhoub / AFP/Getty Images A Syrian refugee boy walks in a muddy alley at a makeshift camp near the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon, in 2013.

Clutching her hand was her bashful 3-year-old daughter, Sidra, her face dominated by a grey Tom & Jerry cap.\n\nAs she spoke, Merii glanced at a woman in a hijab approaching the pool of rainwater that had formed at the entrance of the U.N. refugee agency compound. The woman teetered dangerously on high-heel sandals, one strap broken, the water lapping at her feet.\n\nMerii had left the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib five years ago. She and her husband, a construction worker, were struggling to pay rent and feed their family. Although they failed to qualify for resettlement, she said she didn\u2019t care and wanted to return to Syria.\n\n\u201cThe whole world has been against Syrians, so what, now it\u2019s only about Trump?\u201d she said with a tight smile on her face.\n\nLebanon, whose population before the Syrian civil war was 4.3 million according to the World Bank, has taken in 1.1 million registered refugees \u2014 with an estimated 400,000 more off the books \u2014 a whopping 37% increase in its overall population. (The equivalent would be more than 100 million refugees flooding the U.S.)\n\nThey have seen their assistance slashed as aid agencies, faced with funding shortfalls, struggle to handle the deluge. And though Syrians in the past made up a significant percentage of Lebanon\u2019s work force, the government has placed new regulations banning them from occupying certain white-collar jobs.\n\n\u201cWinter ends with us in debt. And people refuse to lend you more money after you\u2019ve come to them once or twice,\u201d said Ibrahim Ali Baroud, a laborer who had come to register his 2-month old daughter for assistance. Rain and cold temperatures means he spends days without work.\n\n\u201cIt's all against Syrians. Look how it is here. There\u2019s no employment, and aid is not enough to cover the basic requirements of life.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Monday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem \u201creiterated the Syrian government\u2019s call for the Syrian refugees in the neighboring countries to return to their homeland, affirming the government\u2019s readiness to receive them and provide their requirements,\u201d according to a report by the official Syrian Arab News Agency.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Nabih Bulos", "type": "article"}
