Jerry Brown explains his measured approach to Trump", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-essential-washington-updates-amid-pressure-to-attack-jerry-brown-1490052702-htmlstory.html", "text": "When Gov. Jerry Brown landed in Washington on Monday on his mission to raise awareness about the nuclear threat and secure funding for disaster relief in the state, he didn\u2019t strike the tone of defiance many are looking for from the Democrats\u2019 most influential voice in the West.\n\nBrown is taking a noticeably measured approach to the new White House. Even after President Trump has put himself on a path of confrontation with California on so many issues \u2014 threatening the state\u2019s sanctuary cities, its landmark fuel mileage standards and its precarious budget \u2014 Brown says he\u2019s not going to be pressured by the left into relentlessly attacking the White House.\n\n\u201cI will pursue my own rhetorical paths,\u201d Brown said to reporters Monday after a meeting at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \u201cAt least in the spirit of advancing the interest of California, recognizing we are a part of the Union and \u2026 we are not going a totally separate way. We are distinct. We have a sovereignty. We will pursue that. But we also have a commonality with other states and with the national government. So wherever we are going to find common ground, we are going to do it.\u201d\n\nBrown said \"he wouldn\u2019t rule anything out or anything in\" when it comes to California\u2019s dealings with Washington.\n\n\"Nothing is all that predictable under the current administration,\" he said. \"That could be a cause for alarm, but also a cause for some optimism and creative possibilities.\"\n\nOf course, Brown\u2019s motivation for the trip was to bring attention to the threat of a nuclear apocalypse, which he said is as big a danger now as during the Cold War. But even on that issue he was reluctant to lay blame on Trump, who many disarmament experts say has elevated the potential for doomsday with his loose talk about nuclear weapons and aggressive posture toward other nations that have nuclear capability.\n\nAsked if the nuclear threat has increased under Trump, Brown said: \u201cI would say it hasn\u2019t been diminished. I don\u2019t want to speculate. It\u2019s a little early.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Evan Halper", "type": "article"}
