And that includes five that were covered by his travel ban that expired Sunday.\n\nThe indefinite restrictions apply to citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea. As part of the presidential proclamation, the U.S. will also bar the entry of certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate families.\n\nThe changes will take effect October 18. The announcement Sunday came on the same day that Trump's temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
