And then each country can make up their decision, whether they want to bid or not based on the requirements. Nothing to do with the U.S. or not, it's general sporting criterion.\"\n\nInfantino avoided directly criticizing Trump's policies.\n\n\"Mr. Trump is the president of the United States of America and as such of course (I have) huge respect for what he does,\" Infantino said following FIFA meetings in London. \"He's in charge, together with his government, to take the decisions that are best for his country. That's why he has been elected.\"\n\nFIFA has recently had to deal with the impact of a country restricting visas for one of its events. The FIFA Congress in May has been moved to Bahrain from Kuala Lumpur after Malaysia withdrew from hosting, citing problems allowing entry to some delegates, including officials from Israel.\n\n\"In the world there are certainly many countries who have bans, travel bans, visa requirements and so on and so forth,\" Infantino said.\n\nThe United States is mulling a three-way hosting bid with Canada and Mexico. A potential obstacle to the triple hosting is Trump's determination to build a wall on the Mexican border to help stem illegal immigration, with tensions between the countries over who would fund the border barrier.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-09", "authors": "Rob Harris", "type": "article"}
