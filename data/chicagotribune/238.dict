During that time officers seized Hamedani's phone and he wasn't allowed to use the bathroom, he said.\n\n\"They never used the word detained, so I wasn't under any kind of arrest \u2026 but I was questioned two times regarding my place of birth, which is Iran, and regarding my work,\" Hamedani said. \"They ask about my Facebook and they check my Twitter.\"\n\nHamedani missed his connecting flight to Los Angeles but considered that a small misfortune compared with the disappointment suffered by a group of LGBT asylum-seekers he met at an airport in Turkey. They had fled Iran for Turkey and were bound for the U.S. until Friday evening's announcement by Trump ruined those plans.\n\n\"Their flights are canceled,\" Hamedani said. \"They cannot go back to Iran, and they cannot come to America. I don't know what we can do for them, but at least we can think about them.\" He added, \"Immediately, (when) the news came up, they were crying.\"\n\nProtesters have rallied at O'Hare International Airport after authorities took travelers into custody in response to President Donald Trump's immigration order. Lawyers from throughout Chicago showed up to assist travelers.\n\nTrump's executive order freezes entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts Syrian refugees indefinitely and places a 90-day moratorium on the arrival of citizens of the predominantly Muslim countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAt least 50 people were held Sunday at O'Hare for further questioning, including those from non-Muslim countries like Mexico, according to lawyers at the scene. It was unclear whether the questioning of the Mexican travelers was related to Trump's order.\n\nA 19-year-old German national working in the suburbs as an au pair broke down in tears as she was waiting for her friend, a German citizen born in Iraq, after the friend was held for questioning.\n\nThe young women have been in the U.S. working for families since August 2015. They extended their visas to stay another year and were returning Sunday from vacation in Mexico when they were swept up by the new policy.\n\n\"I am afraid they won't let her go,\" said the 19-year-old, who asked not to be identified out of concern for her immigration status. \"I think it's crazy. It's discriminating against these people.\"\n\nThe woman is a Muslim who was born in Serbia, a country not affected by the ban. After about an hour, her friend was released.\n\nOn Saturday, more than a dozen travelers were placed in custody. All of them had some kind of legal status in the United States, lawyers said. Though all the detainees were eventually released as a result of a court ruling Saturday that effectively suspended some of Trump's travel ban, the presidential directive has stoked fears among the immigrant community \u2014 whether they are refugees or permanent residents.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the Department of Homeland Security on Sunday issued a statement saying it will \"continue to enforce all of President Trump's Executive Orders\" while at the same time vowing to \"comply with judicial orders.\"\n\nFor the second straight day, hundreds of protesters occupied an area at Terminal 5 of O'Hare with signs reading \"No Ban, No Wall,\" while chanting slogans like, \"Refugees welcome here! No hate, no fear!\"\n\nPolice stood at the entrances of the arrival doorways and loosely around metal barricades where protesters rallied.\n\nRozi Bhimani, of Evanston, waved a poster with the image of a woman wearing a star-spangled hijab bearing the words \"We the people.\" The daughter of a Pakistani father, Bhimani said she wanted to vocalize her opposition to the travel ban on Middle East countries.\n\n\"I want to send a strong message that we want to see the rule of law and court orders enforced,\" she said. \"I will be very concerned if the executive branch does not listen to the judicial branch.\"\n\nIn Morton Grove, about 500 people packed the basement of the Muslim Education Center on Sunday while hundreds more spilled upstairs and outside the building, during a demonstration calling for sanctuary and support for Muslims and other minority groups against recent Trump administration actions.\n\n\"Each day it's imperative we live in concern and know what our government is doing. It's also imperative that we don't live in fear but live in hope, that, as a collaboration, we can make an impact. This march/rally \u2026 is to empower all marginalized groups and give hope for the future. We can make a difference together,\" said Dilnaz Waraich of the Muslim Community Center.\n\nProtesters carried signs, heart-shaped balloons and cameras, and they included elderly couples with canes and wheelchairs, babies in strollers, and all ages in between.\n\n\"Our local governments must stand in firm solidarity with our Muslim and Arab neighbors in showing their opposition to these immoral executive orders by passing sanctuary laws declaring their commitment not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement,\" said Lesley Williams of Jewish Voice for Peace Chicago.\n\nAt O'Hare, more than 150 pro bono attorneys were camped out to aid people who were being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAttorney Richard Goldwasser said he returned to the airport at 6 a.m. Sunday to offer legal resources to people who may need it.\n\n\"We came here today not knowing what to expect, how stringent they were going to apply the executive order, and I'm not sure they know,\" he said. \"One of the problems from the beginning yesterday was the CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) is not giving us any information. Are they holding people? Who are they holding? Their names?\"\n\nTrump's executive order garnered sharp condemnation from several prominent figures in Chicago, including Cardinal Blase Cupich, who characterized the measure as \"a dark moment in U.S. history.\"\n\n\"The world is watching as we abandon our commitments to American values,\" Cupich said in a statement. \"These actions give aid and comfort to those who would destroy our way of life. They lower our estimation in the eyes of the many peoples who want to know America as a defender of human rights and religious liberty, not a nation that targets religious populations and then shuts its doors on them.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Elyssa Cherney, Nereida Moreno, Tony Briscoe", "type": "article"}
