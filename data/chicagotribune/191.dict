{"title": "Trump administration appeals halt of travel ban", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-travel-ban-appeal-20170317-story.html", "text": "The Trump administration filed a notice in a Maryland federal district court on Friday that it would appeal the court\u2019s decision halting the president\u2019s revised travel ban.\n\nThe case, in which the judge on Thursday ruled against President Trump\u2019s effort to stop immigration for 90 days from six majority-Muslim countries, heads to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. The administration is asking the appeals court to reverse the lower court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Maryland case, which was brought on behalf of immigrants and nonprofit groups that work with refugees, followed a Hawaii federal court\u2019s broader order against the travel ban on Wednesday. That order stopped its pause on immigration from the six nations and its 120-day moratorium on refugee resettlement.\n\nThe travel ban was supposed to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday.\n\nBoth courts found Trump\u2019s travel rules to run afoul of the Constitution by discriminating against Muslims. The courts pointed to Trump\u2019s statements promising to suspend Muslim immigration and interviews with campaign and White House officials to make their cases.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Muslim ban has fared miserably in the courts, and for good reason \u2014 it violates fundamental provisions of our Constitution. We look forward to defending this careful and well-reasoned decision in the appeals court,\u201d Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued against the travel ban in the Maryland court, said in a statement Friday.\n\nTrump has vowed to take the travel ban to the Supreme Court and has said it falls within his rights as president to control immigration and protect the country from terrorism.\n\nSpeaking at a Nashville rally this week, Trump called the revised travel order a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of a Jan. 27 executive order that was halted by a Seattle federal judge. That judge\u2019s decision was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe first travel ban stopped refugee resettlement from all countries for 120 days \u2014 and from Syria indefinitely \u2014 and banned citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days while the government was to review its vetting procedures.\n\nThe new order attempted to address court concerns by removing a preference for refugees who are religious minorities and giving exemptions from the travel order to green-card holders and those who already have valid visas. It also removed Iraq from the list of countries whose citizens could not come to the U.S.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
