And we haven't had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right.\"\n\nTrump insisted the order was within his executive powers and \"a bad high school student would understand this.\"\n\nThe panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit on Tuesday aggressively questioned a Justice Department lawyer about what he considered the limits on the president's power and what evidence Trump relied upon in temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nBut the panel similarly interrogated Washington state's solicitor general, who is challenging the president's directive, over what evidence he had to demonstrate religious discrimination and whether a lower-court judge's freeze on the ban was too broad.\n\nThe court said it expects to make a decision on the matter \"probably this week,\" and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland promised rapid consideration. The ruling could affect tens of thousands of travelers whose visas were revoked by the initial executive order, then restored after U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle put a nationwide stop to it.\n\nThe issue of whether the order is allowed to remain in place while legal challenges continue is likely to end up at the Supreme Court. But it will be harder for the Trump administration to prevail at the high court if the appeals court rules that a nationwide halt is warranted.\n\nThe broad legal question is whether Trump acted within his authority in blocking the entry of people from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Syria and Yemen, or whether his order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims. The judges must also weigh the harm the ban imposes and whether it is proper for them to intervene in a national security matter on which the president is viewed as the ultimate authority.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump added to his barrage of comments decrying the challenge to the order, and casting blame if the decision does not go his way. \"If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled,\" Trump tweeted. \"Politics!\"\n\nLater, before his address to the police chiefs and sheriffs, Trump appeared to describe the legal challenges as \"horrible, dangerous and wrong.\"\n\nJustice Department lawyer August E. Flentje argued Tuesday that the order was \"well within the president's power,\" asserting that Congress and a previous administration had designated the seven affected countries as having problems with terrorism - albeit in a different context.\n\nSome of the judges, though, seemed wary of that claim. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked Flentje if the government had \"pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism.\"\n\nJudge Richard Clifton, a President George W. Bush appointee, noted that the government already had processes in place to screen people coming from those countries and asked, \"Is there any reason for us to think that there's a real risk or that circumstances have changed such that there's a real risk?\"\n\n\"The president determined that there was a real risk,\" Flentje responded.\n\nWashington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that the government was essentially asking the court to \"abdicate\" its role as a check on the executive branch, and he asserted that reinstating the ban would \"throw the country back into chaos.\"\n\nBut Purcell, too, faced critical questions. Clifton said that he was having \"trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected\" - a key point, as the state is trying to demonstrate that Trump's order is intentionally discriminatory and runs afoul of the Constitution.\n\nPurcell pointed to public statements from Trump and his allies. Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for example, recently said: \"So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said: 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' \"\n\nFlentje disputed that the order is a Muslim ban, and he said the judges should limit their consideration to the executive order itself.\n\n\"It is extraordinary to enjoin the president's national security determination based on some newspaper articles, and that's what has happened here,\" he said.\n\nWhichever side loses is sure to take the fight to the Supreme Court. That traditionally has been solid ground for presidents. Justices often defer to a president on matters of immigration and national security, because of his constitutional powers and an additional grant of authority from Congress.\n\nThe politically divisive fight comes as the Supreme Court remains shorthanded following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago; the four Democratic-appointed liberals and four Republican-appointed conservatives often split.\n\nTrump said at a White House event Tuesday that he was prepared to elevate the dispute as needed.\n\n\"We're going to take it through the system,\" he told reporters. \"It's very important for the country . . . We'll see what happens. We have a big court case. We're well represented.\"\n\nFlentje did offer something of a compromise for the judges Tuesday, saying they could limit the lower-court judge's ruling to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future.\n\nPurcell countered that officials had not explained how they would practically implement such an order.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "Matt Zapotosky and Robert Barnes", "type": "article"}
