This year's Match Day \u2014 the day medical school students and some graduates find out where they'll do their post-medical school training, known as residencies \u2014 came amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump's temporary travel bans and just on the heels of changes to the visa processing system.\n\nThose issues added a layer of complexity to the match process, causing worry among foreign doctors hoping to do their residencies here and concern among the hospitals that depend on foreign residents to care for patients.\n\nHospital residency programs across the country chose more than 3,800 foreign applicants for first-year residency spots this year \u2014 nearly 14 percent of all those matched with first-year spots through the main match, according to the National Resident Matching Program. That's slightly more foreign matches than last year even though the number of foreign applicants dropped a bit.\n\nPhil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Anisha Malhotra, facing camera, reacts after opening her letter on March 17, 2017, and finding out she will be going to University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas for her medical residency.

She noted that she worked alongside many foreign doctors at Cook County Health and Hospitals System, where she spent time as part of her Rush medical education. \"They're the smartest people I've ever met. They're such good physicians.\"\n\nAn estimated 100 to 400 doctors could have trouble getting visas to start their residencies this summer if Trump's travel ban is reinstated, according to the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. A federal court put the 90-day ban on immigration for residents of six predominantly Muslim countries on hold this week, but its ultimate fate is uncertain.\n\n\"When we're talking about physicians coming to this country, the executive order couldn't have come out at a worse time,\" said Dr. William Pinsky, commission president and CEO.\n\nMany other residents also could be affected by recent changes to visa processing. Earlier this month, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would temporarily suspend expedited visa processing for all petitions for H-1B visas \u2014 visas that allow highly skilled people from other countries to work in the U.S. Without expedited processing, some foreign doctors selected for U.S. residencies might not get visas fast enough to start their residencies July 1.\n\nHospitals that rely heavily on foreign residents, such as Chicago's Stroger Hospital, have worried throughout the match process about what it all could mean for them.\n\nStroger tried to avoid selecting applicants if there was a serious concern they wouldn't be able to get into the country because of Trump's travel ban, said Dr. John O'Brien, chair of the Department of Professional Education at Stroger. The safety net hospital can't afford for large numbers of residents not to show up.\n\nThe hospital is also still on edge about how the visa processing changes will affect it. In Stroger's internal medicine program, for example, 27 of 40 residents will need visas to do their residencies. H-1B visas aren't the only types of visas residents can get, but most of Stroger's internal medicine residents want H-1Bs more than other types, said Dr. Christine Acob, interim program director of internal medicine.\n\nIf those 27 doctors can't start their residencies on time \"it would be a tremendous hardship on our hospitals,\" O'Brien said. \"Because we're a safety net hospital, it's critical we have residents here to help take care of the patients.\"\n\nPinsky, with the commission, said the travel ban and visa changes have made this year's matching process especially stressful for hospitals and applicants.\n\n\"Everything's been kicked up a notch or two or three or four because of this,\" Pinsky said.\n\nMedical school graduate Ahmed Alsayed, of Sudan, talks about the uncertainty of working in the United States because of President Donald Trump's travel ban.

They eagerly ripped open their envelopes, often with family beside them, to see where they'd spend the next several years of their lives. They had studied for four years in anticipation of the moment.\n\nBut for some of them, the travel ban and visa changes remained at the back of their minds, even though most in the crowd were unaffected individually.\n\nRush medical student Sammy McGowan was thrilled to learn he'd been matched with Rush University Medical Center. But as he went through the match process this year, the travel ban weighed on him. He and other Rush students were among those who rushed to O'Hare International Airport to protest the ban in recent months.\n\n\"When I was on the interview trail, I interviewed side-by-side with students from Sudan, Yemen, people that were living in limbo,\" McGowan said of interviewing for residencies.\n\nMcGowan said he admired Rush's stand on the travel ban. Rush decided it wouldn't do anything differently this year when it came to selecting residents for the match despite the travel ban. Rush doesn't typically rely on international medical graduates as heavily as some other hospitals.\n\n\"For me, that really showed what kind of institution Rush was,\" McGowan said, \"and that was a big part of the reason I wanted to stay.\"\n\nlschencker@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @lschencker", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-17", "authors": "Lisa Schencker", "type": "article"}
