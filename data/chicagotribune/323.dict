So did the question of whether the administration would comply with orders from federal judges to temporarily halt the travel ban.\n\nRaucous protests erupted in airport terminals from coast to coast. Tens of thousands of people protested outside the gates of the White House, in Boston's Copley Square and in New York's Battery Park, with its views over the Statue of Liberty.\n\nScenes of relief, anxiety and sorrow played out around the globe.\n\nAt Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, a 70-year-old Iranian woman who recently received her green card was released after being detained overnight. In New York City, a graduate student contemplated whether he would quit his doctoral program to rejoin his wife in Iran after she was blocked from returning to the United States.\n\nAnd in Iraq, a man who had risked his life working on behalf of the U.S. government bleakly wondered about his future and that of his wife and three children. Visas in hand, the family was due to fly Monday to the United States. \"It's like someone's stabbed me in the heart with a dagger,\" he said.\n\nTrump issued a statement late Sunday afternoon that offered little clarity, even as he defended his executive order as necessary to protect the United States from terrorism.\n\n\"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" Trump said in the statement. \"This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.\"\n\nThe president reiterated that the country would resume issuing visas to all countries \"once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.\"\n\nGenna Martin / Seattlepi.com Seattle City Councilwoman and socialist activist Kshama Sawant raises a fist over the crowd as more than 1,000 people gather at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Seattle to protest President Donald Trump's refugee and immigrant order Jan. 28, 2017.

Even as the president and other top advisers defended the ban, some Trump officials appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of the action: its impact on green-card holders, who are permanent legal residents of the United States.\n\n\"As far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn't affect them,\" Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" contradicting what government officials had said only a day earlier.\n\nIn a separate statement, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly was less definitive, suggesting that green-card holders' status would help them gain entry to the country but that they nonetheless would be subject to a \"case-by-case\" review.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly's department indicated separately Sunday that it would continue to implement Trump's directive, even as it said it \"will comply with judicial orders\" issued by federal judges over the weekend, blocking enforcement of the ban to varying degrees.\n\n\"Prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the agency said in a statement. \"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.\"\n\nTrump's virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom.\n\nAs the legal questions surrounding the order remained unanswered Sunday, the uncertainty and resentment unleashed by the executive order he signed two days earlier showed few signs of waning.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, lawyers seeking to represent people who had been detained failed to get information from Customs and Border Protection officials despite repeated attempts.\n\nEven three Democratic members of Congress - Reps. Gerald Connolly and Don Beyer of Virginia and Jamie Raskin of Maryland - ran into similar roadblocks. Connolly pressed an airport police officer to get a Customs and Border Protection official to meet with the lawmakers to tell them how many people were detained and to see whether they had been able to communicate with their attorneys.\n\n\"Are people being detained?\" Connolly asked the officer. \"How can you enforce the law if you're not enforcing a judge's order?\"\n\nConnolly soon was on the phone with a CBP congressional affairs official. He and the other members pressed for information on possible detainees, including those traveling on a flight from Turkey. No one on site from the agency would meet with them.\n\n\"That is unacceptable. It is our understanding you are detaining people,\" Connolly said. \"Our understanding is you have not followed that [court] order.\"\n\nThe president's far-reaching action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who plan to assemble Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court in a show of solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. In addition, at least one House member said he plans to introduce legislation to overturn Trump's action by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.\n\nTrump also encountered growing opposition Sunday from lawmakers in his own party.\n\n\"You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright.\n\nSens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., also spoke out against the action, saying in a joint statement that the government has a responsibility to defend its borders but must uphold \"all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.\"\n\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\" they said, adding, \"Such a hasty process risks harmful results.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Brady Dennis, Jerry Markon", "type": "article"}
