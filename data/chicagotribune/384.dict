It is \u201cprospective in nature \u2014 applying only to foreign nationals outside of the United States who do not have a valid visa,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly.\n\nBut many critics of the first order were not declaring victory. Instead, they said they would go back to court and argue the order should still be struck down because it discriminates against Muslims.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than Muslim Ban 2.0,\u201d said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. \u201cNo amount of tweaks will change that.\u201d\n\nDavid Cole, the ACLU\u2019s national legal director, said the revised order is \u201cstill religious discrimination in the pretextual guise of national security. And it\u2019s still unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nBut advocates for immigrants face at least three significant hurdles if they sue.\n\nFirst, they must find plaintiffs who have standing to get into court. Usually, foreign citizens outside the country do not have standing to sue and claim a right to be admitted. The right to \u201cdue process of law\u201d is limited to people who are within the country.\n\nIn the challenge to the original travel ban, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the state of Washington may have \u201cthird party standing\u201d to sue on behalf of professors and students who were barred from traveling. But because the new order does not restrict foreign nationals who have been in this country \u201cfor a continuous period of work, study or other long-term activity,\u201d that path into court may no longer be available.\n\nSecond, they need to show an immediate and \u201cirreparable harm\u201d from allowing Trump\u2019s order from taking effect. Judges may issue an order to temporarily block a government decree, but to get such an order, lawyers must show that not acting immediately will cause real harm. That is no doubt why Kelly emphasized the impact of the new order is \u201cprospective,\u201d not immediate.\n\nBecause the new order does not permanently block anyone from entering the country, but only imposes a 90-day freeze on giving out new visas, the standard of \u201cirreparable harm\u201d could be difficult to meet.\n\nAnd third, they must overcome the president\u2019s unusually broad powers to decide who may enter the country. The Immigration and Nationality Act says the president \u201cmay by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem appropriate.\u201d\n\nGovernment lawyers defending the first travel ban relied on this provision, but the 9th Circuit did not mention in it in its 29-page opinion rebuking Trump.\n\nCivil libertarians say that Trump\u2019s order is based on religious bias, and they say it should be struck down for that reason.\n\nTheir case relies mostly on comments by Trump, rather than the text of the order.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2015, then-candidate Trump issued a news release calling \u201cfor a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2017, two days after the new president signed the first travel ban, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Trump had called him about the proposed Muslim ban and said, \u201cShow me the right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nOne federal judge, citing Trump\u2019s comments, blocked his order on the grounds it may violate the 1st Amendment\u2019s ban on an establishment of religion. It\u2019s hard to ignore what Trump said prior to his election, said U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema.\n\n\u201cA person is not made brand new simply by taking the oath of office,\u201d she wrote on Feb. 13.\n\nTo rebut a possible religious discrimination claim, Justice Department lawyers pushed to get language added to the new order that specifically said the previous version had not been \u201cmotivated by animus toward any religion.\u201d\n\nThey also pushed for a detailed discussion in the new order of the terror threats posed by each of the six countries subject to a temporary travel ban. The new version of the order also drops a preference for people from persecuted minority religious groups, which Trump, in a television interview, had suggested was designed to help Christians from the Mideast.\n\nAdministration officials say the revised order cannot be described as a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d because it extends to only six countries with Muslim majorities and does not include larger nations, including Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nStaff Writer Del Quentin Wilber contributed to this report.\n\ndavid.savage@latimes.com\n\nOn Twitter: DavidGSavage\n\nALSO:\n\nTrump orders new, narrower travel ban that goes into effect in 10 days\n\nGold Star father Khizr Khan canceled speech in Toronto after being told his travel privileges were under review\n\nAfghan family detained in L.A. to be freed, attorney says", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "David G.
