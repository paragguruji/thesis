It asked for a judge to intervene and stop the application of the part of the order that suspends visas to citizens of those seven countries.\n\nJuweiya Abdiaziz Ali, one of the plaintiffs, is a U.S. citizen living in Seattle who started the process in August of bringing her son from Somalia. But Trump's order has her worried that her son's visa process will be indefinitely suspended, she said.\n\nLike thousands of others, those named in the lawsuit pursued the immigrant visa process that includes hundreds of dollars in filing fees, security screenings, medical examinations and interviews, Matt Adams, the group's legal director said previously.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the order, saying more restrictions are needed to protect the U.S. from future terrorist attacks.\n\nThe new deadline for federal government attorneys to respond to the motion is March 20.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-03", "authors": "Lisa Baumann", "type": "article"}
