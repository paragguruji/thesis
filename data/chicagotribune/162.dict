The 55-year-old mom, never particularly active in politics, went outside, looked up at the nearby Trump Tower office building and flipped the icon of the new president the double bird.\n\nFrom that point, there was no turning back. Within days she had organized a Trump resistance group, donned a pink pussyhat and drove 14 hours with a carload of like-minded crusaders to the Women\u2019s March in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all terrified at what\u2019s going on \u2014 that our country is going to be somehow ruined,\u201d said Lisa, who kick-started early retirement to focus almost full time on civic activism. Even so, she\u2019s reluctant to allow her full name to be used, worried about how her efforts could affect her life and her family.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s election has mobilized thousands of first-time activists in a do-it-yourself movement like nothing seen on the political left in years. With bountiful energy and some impressive early successes, the grass-roots movement has stunned even Democratic Party officials, drawing comparisons to the tea party movement that transformed the GOP with its unyielding opposition after President Obama\u2019s election.\n\nWomen nationwide \u2014 and much of the movement is being fueled by women \u2014 are organizing via Facebook, email and often tearful support meetings around kitchen tables.\n\nThe Indivisible Project, launched after Trump\u2019s election, has already sprouted nearly 6,000 chapters nationwide, at least two in each of the 435 congressional districts.\n\nMore established activist groups like MoveOn.org \u2014 which holds weekly \u201cResist Trump Tuesdays\u201d protests \u2014 are enjoying a surge in membership, particularly in blue states, but most surprisingly in some deep-red pockets, where liberals had largely kept quieter. One Colorado activist said that in past years, event turnout rarely matched the number of advance sign-ups; now it routinely surpasses it.\n\nThese newly minted activists \u2014 along with other long-standing protest groups on the left \u2014 flooded the U.S. Capitol switchboard during Senate confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s Cabinet, pushed Democrats to filibuster Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination and helped tank the president\u2019s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 often by noisily protesting at lawmakers\u2019 town hall meetings.\n\nWith old-school organizing and modern-day social media they have formed instant communities that can mobilize hundreds \u2014 even thousands \u2014 as a group of stay-at-home moms in Kenosha, Wis., did recently to protest Trump\u2019s visit there.\n\n\u201cWe always told our kids there\u2019s a lot of really smart people in our country, and we all want to make it better,\u201d said Julia Kozel, one of the women who organized the Kenosha rally. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel like I could say that anymore.\u201d\n\nLisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times Jodi Muerhoff, left, and Julia Kozel organized a Trump resistance group in Kenosha, Wis.

(Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLike the tea party activists before them, many of the resisters \u2014 as they call themselves \u2014 are newcomers to the political process. And much in the same way tea party activists grieved for the country they no longer recognized under Obama, these women recount being devastated that fellow Americans elected Trump and say they are fighting to restore their own vision of the country.\n\nPublicly, Democratic officials embrace the newfound energy on the left. Party strategists even marvel at the large turnouts that they had been unable to achieve in recent years.\n\nBut privately, many Democrats also worry the movement is whipping up a deep-rooted emotional and ideological fervor, much like the tea party did in blocking Obama\u2019s agenda. Unpredictable and with no clear leadership, the liberal uprising could prove difficult to contain and may turn its anger \u2014 currently focused on Trump \u2014 toward the Democratic Party itself, just as the tea party fractured the GOP.\n\nWounds from the 2016 primary battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont still run deep among Democrats, and the protest movement could split the party further between moderates and progressives.\n\nEven Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a favorite among progressives, found herself under fire after voting to confirm Housing Secretary Ben Carson. Some progressives threatened to challenge the Massachusetts liberal in the next primary.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein felt pressured enough to hold her first town hall in years early this month. There she was heckled as a \u201csellout\u201d from an occasionally rowdy crowd of liberals.\n\nWhen airport protests erupted over Trump\u2019s first travel ban, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) raced to Dulles International Airport to demonstrate his solidarity.\n\n\u201cNo party is safe,\u201d said Jeanne Peters, a jewelry designer in West Virginia, whose Indivisible chapter has started calling its House member and both its Republican and Democratic senator every weekday with a coordinated message, such as demanding a congressional vote on Syrian airstrikes or opposing the GOP healthcare plan.\n\nIf the threat from the left wasn\u2019t evident enough, a new political action committee, #WeWillRreplaceYou, is raising money to back primary campaigns against Democrats they view as insufficiently progressive \u2014 much the way outside conservative groups targeted \u201cRINOs,\u201d politicians they considered Republicans in Name Only.\n\nVoters who are \u201cfed up with the Democratic Party at every level want to see their Democratic representatives stand up and fight Trump,\u201d said Claire Sandberg, a former Sanders organizer who is a cofounder of the PAC.\n\nAnother group run by former Sanders allies, Brand New Congress, is recruiting challengers for every single House district \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 in 2018.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-23", "authors": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "article"}
