Bruce Rauner to demonstrate opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration plans while Rauner's state party accused her of trying to stop state worker paychecks to shill for her father, House Speaker Michael Madigan.\n\nThe actions represented a ratcheting up of the rhetoric and political animosity between Rauner, who is the main source of financing for the state GOP, and Democrats whose power he's trying to erode in Springfield amid a stalemate that's left Illinois without a full budget since July 2015.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the attorney general issued a letter to Rauner urging him to \"use your authority as the governor of one of the most diverse states in the nation to protect all of the residents of Illinois \u2014 along with our employers and educational institutions \u2014 from the harm caused by these executive actions.\"\n\nShe specifically requested that Rauner refuse to enter into agreements to use Illinois law enforcement authorities as immigration officers, commit to strong enforcement of Illinois anti-discrimination laws and bolster the immigrant and refugee work conducted within the state Department of Human Services.\n\n\"Deputizing Illinois law enforcement as immigration officers would not only divert already scarce resources away from public safety efforts and raise serious legal questions, but also undermine the values on which the country was built,\" the attorney general's office said.\n\nRauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly called the attorney general's letter a \"press release\" that was \"detached from reality\" and an attempt to \"distract from her efforts to stop the pay of state employees and force a crisis in Illinois.\"\n\nKelly said Rauner \"has no intention\" of deputizing state police as immigration officers, signed legislation to strengthen the hate crime statute and backed resettlement of thousands of refugees. Rauner's office also pointed to a March 2015 letter to agencies under his control, saying the governor \"expects strict compliance with all laws that prohibit discrimination in the workplace, housing and public accommodation.\"\n\nRauner has supported a pause in the immigration of refugees from war-torn Syria. More recently, the governor expressed concerns about Trump's executive order, calling it \"overly broad and a little bit hurried and rash\" during an appearance last week before the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board.\n\nTrump's executive order on immigrant and refugee travel has been put on hold by a federal court, pending appeal. Madigan's office released her letter to Rauner while also joining other Democratic attorneys general in filing friend of the court briefs with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that support the continued blocking of the executive order.\n\nThe attorney general's letter to Rauner came hours after state GOP Chairman Tim Schneider criticized her for seeking to lift a St. Clair County judge's order requiring state workers to be paid during the budget impasse.\n\nSchneider, a Republican Cook County commissioner from Bartlett, said her actions were at the behest of her father. He offered no proof but contended that Michael Madigan's \"fingerprints are all over this\" and that the speaker was \"cut out\" of compromise attempts in the state Senate.\n\nLisa Madigan said in a Sunday op-ed in the State Journal-Register of Springfield that she decided to act after a six-month stopgap measure expired Jan. 1. She contended continued state employee pay had become a disincentive for Rauner and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly to reach a budget deal.\n\nSchneider was asked by a reporter if the language of the state constitution was clear in saying that state payments could not be made in absence of a lawful appropriation. He didn't address the question.\n\n\"I would say this, that the Illinois Republican Party believes that a shutdown of this government would harm Illinois workers and Illinois families, and we would not like to see that happen,\" Schneider said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nrap30@aol.com Twitter @rap30", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Rick Pearson", "type": "article"}
