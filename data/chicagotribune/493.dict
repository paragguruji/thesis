They are frankly concerned about leaving home because they don't know what will happen when they get out in the community.\"\n\nThough the school has not been made aware of any threats of violence or harassment against students with ties to the countries named in the ban, Pressler said there is a sense of worry among some in the school community.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's executive order, signed Friday, suspends entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocks entry for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order also bars green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States.\n\nHessan Noorian, a Park Ridge resident and green card holder who was traveling home with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their 6-month-old son after visiting family in his native Iran, was detained for several hours at O'Hare Airport on Saturday as a result of the executive order.\n\nMaine East school counselors, social workers, teachers, and the school resource officer are available to help counsel students who feel affected by the travel ban, Pressler said.\n\n\"What is challenging for me as an adult and educator in the building is that I want to comfort kids who are genuinely upset and say, 'It's going to be OK.' But I don't think any of us can say that,\" Pressler said. \"I think we can say we can do everything we can to make this a safe place and support them, but it's a pretty uncertain time right now.\"\n\nPressler added that Maine East will continue to \"honor our diversity \u2014 the religious, ethnic and cultural diversity we've had for years and years.\"\n\nAt Maine South High School, which has a less diverse student body than Maine East, Principal Shawn Messmer said the school is \"not specifically addressing the president's recent executive orders and how they are affecting our students, as I have not become aware that any are.\" He did say that counselors are always available to students who are \"affected by any disruptive force to their education.\"\n\nOakton Community College, which educates students of various ethnic and religious backgrounds at its campuses in Des Plaines and Skokie, issued a statement Monday in support of \"welcoming individuals from all countries to study, teach and carry out scholarly activities at our institution.\"\n\n\"Oakton Community College has been strengthened by the presence of students and faculty from around the world, including those from the seven countries specifically mentioned in President Trump's recent executive order,\" the statement reads.\n\nTribune staff contributed to this report\n\njjohnson@pioneerlocal.com\n\nTwitter: @Jen_Tribune", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Jennifer Johnson", "type": "article"}
