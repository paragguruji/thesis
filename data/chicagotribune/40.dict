{"title": "Are the president's policies hurting the Trump hotels?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-hotels-policies-20170227-story.html", "text": "Since President Trump took office, controversy over some of his policies has triggered noisy protests and rallies in front of hotels emblazoned with the Trump name.\n\nIt is uncertain if the rallies and protests have hurt business at Trump hotels but online travel sites that book Trump hotels have come under increasing fire from critics of the president.\n\nTrump Hotels includes eight properties in the U.S. and five international locations that are either managed or branded by the New York company, founded by Donald J. Trump.\n\nOnline travel booking sites such as Hotwire and Priceline are under attack on social media from Trump critics who say they fear those sites may book them into a Trump hotel without their knowledge.\n\nTravelers who use Hotwire.com and \u201cExpress Deals\u201d on Priceline.com can request a room in a specific city but aren\u2019t told the hotel name until after they pay. Hotels, car rental companies and airlines can use such \u201cblind\u201d booking sites to unload vacant rooms, empty airline seats and unused cars without lowering their prices on traditional sales channels.\n\nBut since Trump was elected, a growing chorus of Trump critics has complained that Hotwire and Priceline have booked them into Trump hotels. They are asking the websites to either eliminate Trump hotels from the sites or give travelers the option to block Trump hotels from their lodging search.\n\n\u201cWARNING: Do not use @hotwire! Their \"hot rates\" include #Trump hotels & they will not cancel. Learn from my mistake. #NeverTrump,\u201d Dave Vanness, a data scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, posted on Twitter recently.\n\nBernard Harcourt, a law professor at Columbia University, has called for a boycott of Hotwire on Twitter, saying he searched for a room in Chicago on Hotwire to attend a protest of Trump\u2019s travel ban and got booked into the Trump International Hotel & Tower.\n\nHotwire declined to say if bookings on the site have dropped since Trump was elected, but company spokeswoman Geena Marcelia said, \u201cwe are aware that certain travelers have shared concerns around booking a Trump Hotel property.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur customers\u2019 satisfaction is very important to us,\u201d she said. \u201cTo that end, we are currently taking these comments into careful consideration.\u201d\n\nPriceline declined to discuss the controversy.\n\nTrump Hotels doesn\u2019t report its financial data to the public but a spokeswoman said the company has enjoyed a 10% increase in reservations in 2016 over the previous year.\n\n\u201cOur business is incredibly strong,\u201d Trump Hotels spokeswoman Christine Lin said. \u201cWe are exceeding targets across a variety of metrics, including overall bookings, website visits and revenue.\u201d\n\nStill, the kind of controversy that has erupted since Trump took office Jan. 20 can\u2019t be good for a hotel brand, said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality.\n\n\u201cLook at it from a corporation\u2019s standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are booking a meeting, you are going to look for a hotel that is going to help you, not hurt you. A corporation may have Muslim people they want to attend the meeting.\u201d\n\nhugo.martin@latimes.com\n\nTo read more about the travel and tourism industries, follow @hugomartin on Twitter.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "authors": "Hugo Martin", "type": "article"}
