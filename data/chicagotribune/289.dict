Kelly brought President Trump\u2019s promised crackdown on illegal immigration one step closer to reality. Kelly lifted nearly all restrictions on targeting the 11-million people in the U.S. illegally for deportation.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what happened:\n\nWho is affected?\n\nImmigration officers were directed to focus first on deporting convicted criminals or those charged with crimes. But Kelly also freed them to conduct more raids in immigrant communities and detain people who don\u2019t have criminal convictions.\n\nIn addition to deporting those convicted of crimes, immigration officials will also target:\n\npeople in the country illegally who have been charged with crimes not yet adjudicated.\n\nthose who have not been charged but are believed to have committed \u201cacts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\u201d That would include the 6 million people believed to have entered without passing through an official border crossing.\n\nthose who receive an improper welfare benefit.\n\nthose who committed minor infractions such as driving without a license.\n\nWhen does this start?\n\nImmigration officials can act on their new priorities immediately.\n\nAmong their first targets could be the more than 940,000 people who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and have either refused to leave or were allowed to stay temporarily, often because of the hardship their deportation would cause to family in the U.S.\n\nHas the Trump administration already increased deportations?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet. Although advocates have warned that recent raids appear to be a ramping up of immigration enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials insist that they were long planned.\n\nDeportation totals from Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office won\u2019t be known for months.\n\nHow many people were deported under the Obama administration?\n\nUnder President Obama, immigration officials increased deportations to an annual peak of about 400,000 people in 2012.\n\nFollowing widespread outcry from immigration advocates, Homeland Security backed down on deportations, ordering agents to focus on expelling criminals, repeat immigration violators and recent arrivals. As a result, deportation totals fell to about 240,000 last year.\n\nHow will deportations increase?\n\nImmigration officers were ordered to conduct more raids to find people charged with crimes or already ordered deported by a judge. Relatives, friends and others found during those raids who are in the country illegally could also be sent into deportation proceedings, even if they don\u2019t have criminal records.\n\nThe Trump administration will also expand who is eligible for so-called expedited removals. Under these types of deportations, someone in the U.S. illegally can be removed without appearing before an immigration judge. The Obama administration limited them to people caught within 100 miles of the border within two weeks of entering the country.\n\nThe Trump administration is drafting a notice to be published in the Federal Register to greatly expand their use. Expedited removals will apply to people caught anywhere in the country within two years of arriving illegally.\n\nHow can that many people be deported that quickly?\n\nEven without hiring more deportation officers, Trump could boost deportations by more than 75% during his first year in office just by returning to the level of deportations reached at the end of Obama\u2019s first term, when about 400,000 people were deported in 2012.\n\nAnd in the longer term?\n\nTrump\u2019s original executive order called for hiring 10,000 more immigration enforcement officers and 5,000 Border Patrol agents, as did Kelly\u2019s memos.\n\nKelly also restarted a program called Secure Communities that notifies immigration agents when people in the country illegally are booked into local jails. In addition, the Homeland Security Department will expand a program in which local police help capture those violating immigration laws. Those programs were dialed back under President Obama over concerns they were used to racially profile suspects and sowed distrust between the immigrant community and police.\n\nWhat happens to people who aren\u2019t deported right away?\n\nKelly instructed immigration officials to expand the number and size of detention facilities to hold people awaiting hearings in immigration court as well as asylum seekers. More than 1,100 detention beds have been added since Trump was sworn in last month. Cases for people held in detention can move more quickly, and they can be deported faster than those released and told to appear in court.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants are concerned about the poor conditions in detention facilities, many of which are also local jails and have a track record of substandard medical care. Also, immigrants in detention facilities have a much harder time getting lawyers.\n\nHow do the rights of people in the U.S. illegally compare with those of citizens?\n\nAs with everything in immigration policy, it's complicated.\n\nCourts have upheld that everyone in the U.S. has a right to equal protection and due process before the law. For example, immigration officers can\u2019t enter the home of immigrants in the country illegally without a warrant.\n\nBut once an immigration court has ruled a person can be removed, officers can lawfully detain and deport him or her. Close to the border, agents have more leeway to remove people without going through the immigration courts when they apprehend those who recently crossed into the country illegally.\n\nAlso, courts have ruled that children have a right to free public education, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nI heard some people might be sent back to countries they only passed through.\n\nThat\u2019s possible. The Trump administration is interpreting immigration law as allowing U.S. officials to arrest people who came into the U.S. illegally and send them back to the country they entered from while they await deportation proceedings \u2014 Mexico, in cases of illegal southern border crossings.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-22", "authors": "Brian Bennett, Amy Fiscus", "type": "article"}
