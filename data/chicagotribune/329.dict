This is the second time Hawaii has asked a judge to lift the stay in order to file an amended lawsuit.\n\nLast month, U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu allowed the state to file an amended lawsuit adding the Muslim Association of Hawaii's imam as a plaintiff. The mother-in-law of Imam Ismail Elshikh is a Syrian national living in Syria, according to the lawsuit that details the effect the ban would have had on Elshikh's family and others in Hawaii.\n\nAccording to the motion, attorneys for the government had no position on the request to file another amended lawsuit.\n\nHawaii plans to file its amended lawsuit and a motion for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.\n\nTuesday's motion proposes a hearing on March 15, a day before the revised ban goes into effect.\n\nAttorneys representing Hawaii couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Hawaii has hired a Washington, D.C., law firm to help. Josh Wisch, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said last month the firm is giving the state a 50 percent discount.\n\n\"This new executive order is nothing more than Muslim Ban 2.0,\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement Monday. \"Under the pretense of national security, it still targets immigrants and refugees. It leaves the door open for even further restrictions.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "authors": "Associated Press", "type": "article"}
