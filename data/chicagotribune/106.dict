Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) traveled to the White House Friday to view documents President Trump has said partially vindicate his claim that his predecessor ordered surveillance of him during the campaign.\n\nIn a statement, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said he was told they were \u201cprecisely the same materials\u201d viewed previously by the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), which Schiff said should now be shared with the full panel membership.\n\n\u201cNothing I could see today warranted a departure from the normal review procedures,\u201d Schiff said, adding that he could not discuss the contents of the documents, which remain classified.\n\nNunes was shown the documents last week by White House officials surreptitiously, then announced to reporters the next day that he needed urgently to go to the White House to brief Trump about them.\n\nSchiff, in his statement, said that \u201cthe White House has yet to explain why senior White House staff apparently shared these materials with but one member of either [Intelligence] committee, only for their contents to be briefed back to the White House.\"\n\nSchiff also had a brief but \u201ccordial\u201d meeting with Trump during his time at the White House, a spokesman said.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters earlier Friday that other Democrats have been invited to the White House to view the materials, which he said would \u201cshed light\u201d on their investigation.\n\nBoth the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are conducting separate reviews of Russian interference into the 2016 election; Trump has asked each panel to also probe his own claim that his predecessor engaged in wire tapping of his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign, an assertion that has been denied by Nunes as well as the heads of the FBI and intelligence agencies.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
