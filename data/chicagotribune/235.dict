Of the 15, eight were Iraqis who had been on a flight from Jordan, according to passengers who spoke with the lawyers at O'Hare.\n\nThe Trump administration has issued conflicting statements on how green card holders should be treated under the executive order, a reflection of the chaotic rollout of the president's first major national security initiative. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the ban extended to legal U.S. residents, then reversed course Sunday night when Secretary John Kelly issued a statement deeming \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\"\n\nYet green card holders from the seven majority-Muslim countries listed in Trump's ban \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 are still being subjected to uncommon levels of scrutiny upon arrival at O'Hare. The National Immigration Justice Center, along with the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, issued an advisory Monday telling U.S. residents from those targeted countries to expect hourslong questioning at the airport and that their phones, email and social media accounts may be checked.\n\nIranian-born Gholamreza Behforooz, 65, was held with his wife and 14-year-old son for nearly three hours upon arriving at O'Hare on Monday. The family, legal U.S. residents, immigrated to Muncie, Ind., three years ago in the hopes of a better life for their children. Behforooz's 23-year-old daughter, Mitra, a student at Ball State University, was relieved to finally see her family emerge from customs, though she expressed concerns about what life will be like for them over the next four years.\n\nJose M.

This whole weekend was tragic,\" she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen next.\"\n\nLocal immigration attorneys also are grappling with uncertainty and are advising clients potentially affected by the ban not to leave the country unless absolutely necessary. The recommendation echoes a similar advisory issued by several major Midwest universities Monday, which urged some students and scholars not to travel abroad \"until there is further assessment.\"\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, I would advise my clients to stay here,\" Chicago-based immigration attorney Fiona McEntee said. \"This confusion is just crazy. These are details that should have been taken care before it was signed.\"\n\nMcEntee is one of more than 500 Chicago-area lawyers who have volunteered in recent days to assist travelers affected by Trump's immigration crackdown. Under U.S. law, travelers are not entitled to legal representation at ports of entry, so the lawyers established a makeshift office in the international terminal and have made their services known to families anxiously waiting for detained travelers.\n\nThe lawyers \u2014 who are providing their services for free \u2014 have been hailed as heroes by those opposing the ban. Over the past three days, they have been inundated with pizzas, doughnuts and office supplies from well-wishers, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who brought them coffee and pastries Sunday.\n\nFarhana Rahim, owner of the Goddess and Grocer on the third floor of Terminal 5, donated coffee and pastries to the attorneys for the past two days and has heard from Chicago residents who wanted to buy snacks for the lawyers as well. Rahim said she will send food for as many days as the attorneys huddle in the airport.\n\n\"We're lucky we can do anything, even if it's as little as donating coffee and pastries,\" she said. \"We support the work they are putting in.\"\n\nChicago Tribune's Elyssa Cherney contributed.\n\nnmoreno@chicagotribune.com\n\nsstclair@chicagotribune.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Nereida Moreno, Stacy St. Clair", "type": "article"}
