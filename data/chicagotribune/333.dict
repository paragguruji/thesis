There was no massacre at Bowling Green. Conway's comment instantly inspired memes.\n\nThe next morning, in a tweet, Conway said she had been referring to two Iraqi citizens from Bowling Green, Kentucky, who had been convicted of trying to send weapons and money to al-Qaida.\n\nHer correction came too late for the world.\n\n\"I clarified immediately. I should have said terrorists and not massacre,\" Conway told Kurtz. \"I'm sure it will live on for a week.\"\n\nThe gaffe might seem ironic for Conway, who - like other White House aides and Trump himself - have attacked reporters at length over mistakes.\n\nA Time reporter's erroneous claim that Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office - a tweet that he quickly deleted and apologized for - became a focus of Trump's first speech after Inauguration Day and his press secretary's first briefing.\n\nThe White House was still hammering the mistake days later, when Conway interjected Time's \"falsehood\" into an interview with Chuck Todd on NBC.\n\n\"It was corrected immediately,\" Todd noted.\n\n\"But why, Chuck? Why was it said?\" Conway replied - then brought the mistake up four more times before she let Todd complete a sentence.\n\nConway did not exactly sound chastened in Fox's preview of her interview, which will air Sunday.\n\nShe called some of her critics \"haters,\" Kurtz wrote, without specifying which ones.\n\nMuch of the Bowling Green massacre mockery, in fact, has been issued from Bowling Green itself - where the Associated Press reported a pizza has been named after Conway's mistake.\n\n\"My sense of things is that we are today a city of people walking around and looking at their phones and giggling softly to ourselves,\" one resident told the outlet.\n\nConway didn't mention that in her interview - or at least not in the small portion Kurtz has revealed. But the adviser did take umbrage with a tweet by former president Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\n\n\"Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks.\"\n\n\n\n\"She should leave me out of it,\" Conway said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": "Avi Selk", "type": "article"}
