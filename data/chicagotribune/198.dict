Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the committee chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the ranking member, said in a joint statement.\n\nIn tweets on March 4, Trump accused Obama of wiretapping him and his office building before his inauguration and urged Congress to investigate the claim. A spokesman for Obama described the claim as false, and no evidence has emerged to substantiate it.\n\nThe statement by Burr and Warner, who are conducting an investigation into whether Trump or his associates had improper contact with Russian authorities during the campaign, came a day after the two leaders on the House Intelligence Committee also said they had seen no evidence to support Trump's claims.\n\nFBI Director James Comey will testify before the House panel at a public hearing Monday and will be questioned about Trump's claim, the lawmakers said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "David S.
