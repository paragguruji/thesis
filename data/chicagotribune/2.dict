Trump by its CEO, issued a statement calling immigration \u201ca source of strength\u201d and saying it opposes the administration\u2019s travel ban, while emphasizing its push to raise American manufacuturing capacity.\n\n\"These are not new or revised values,\" said the statement issued early Friday morning. \"This is what we believe. Under Armour and Kevin Plank are for job creation and American manufacturing capabilities. We believe building should be focused on much needed education, transportation, technology and urban infrastructure investment.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"We are against a travel ban and believe that immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour.\"\n\nWith the statement, Under Armour lends its voice to a chorus of companies and others who object to Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Trump argues it\u2019s vital for national security, but a federal appeals court sustained a freeze on the order pending further judicial review.\n\nIt was the second statement the company has issued since CEO Kevin Plank \u2014 in a lengthy interview on CNBC's \u201cHalftime Report\u201d \u2014 said Trump \"wants to make bold decisions and be decisive\" and that having \u201csuch a pro-business president is something that\u2019s a real asset to this country.\u201d\n\nSeveral Under Armour endorsers \u2014 including NBA star Stephen Curry, ballerina Misty Copeland and actor Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson \u2014 have taken issue with Plank\u2019s comments.\n\nIn its initial statement, Under Armour stressed the company\u2019s desire for fair trade, tax reform and an \u201cinclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Jeff Barker", "type": "article"}
