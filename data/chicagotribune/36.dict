It's the day when medical school graduates and students find out at which hospitals they'll do their residencies \u2014 putting into practice what they learned in medical school and honing their skills as doctors.\n\nAspiring residents like Alsayed wonder if they'll be turned away from hospitals that don't want to deal with the potential hassle of hiring physicians who would be subject to a travel ban. And hospitals worry whether the residents they choose will be barred from working in the U.S., leaving them short-handed to care for patients and, over time, making a shortage of doctors in the U.S. more acute.\n\nTrump recently defended the travel ban calling it \"very important for the country\" and saying \"we have to have security in our country.\"\n\nBut hospitals in Illinois and across the nation rely heavily on doctors from abroad.\n\nLast year, about 14 percent of residents who matched through the main matching program \u2014 more than 3,700 people \u2014 were non-U.S. citizens who graduated from medical schools outside the U.S., according to the National Resident Matching Program. This year, more than 42,000 people are expected to apply for 32,000 residency spots across the country, in all.\n\nAbel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Ahmed Alsayed, 22, of Sudan, helps a friend study for a medical school test on Feb. 7, 2017, at their apartment in Chicago's Buena Park neighborhood.

(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune)\n\nIt would be \"disastrous for not only medical education but bad for patient care\" if hospitals can't get the residents they choose because of the travel ban, said Dr. Fred Zar, program director of the internal medicine residency at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine.\n\n\"If we lose that part of the workforce because we can't get enough people in our residency programs because these countries are banned, the ability to take care of the volumes of patients we care for (is) diminished,\" Zar said. \"It's got very deep-running ramifications for health care.\"\n\nZar's particular program doesn't have many residents from other countries, but others certainly do, he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association has asked the Trump administration for guidance on Trump's order to ensure it doesn't keep out qualified med school grads or leave hospitals with unfilled training spots.\n\nHospitals' reliance on residents from other countries varies based on the institution and the specialty. Residency programs in popular specialties at top tier hospitals might not have as many doctors from other countries because so many American medical school grads want to work in them, and Americans might be easier to interview and hire, said Mark Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins, a placement firm specializing in physicians. But less prominent hospitals and less popular specialties might rely more on foreign doctors.\n\nThose hospitals could suffer \u2014 including financially \u2014 if a ban keeps their top choices for residents from entering the U.S. If a resident is selected for a spot at a hospital and then can't follow through because of a ban, some hospitals will still likely be able to fill the spot with a bit of scrambling, but others may not.\n\n\"The resident plays a critical role in not just the care-providing of a hospital but also the financial viability of a hospital,\" Smith said. Residents make an average of $56,500 a year, according to a 2016 Medscape report, but they work up to 80 hours a week. \"They're the cheapest labor you have.\"\n\nHospitals could hedge their bets by simply avoiding those international residents. The National Resident Matching Program is \"concerned\" that hospitals might not rank those applicants, said Mona Signer, program president and CEO.\n\nThe program recently released a statement urging medical educators to support international medical graduate students and \"make the best decisions they can under current circumstances.\"\n\n\"The affected applicants have worked hard for many years to achieve their goal of becoming physicians, and they should not be denied that opportunity because of a blanket policy that does not consider the individual,\" according to the statement. \"Similarly, U.S. training programs should be able to select applicants based on their excellent character and qualifications, without regard to nationality.\"\n\nRush University Medical Center has already decided not to take applicants' nationality into account as it ranks its top choices for residents this year, said Dr. Richard Abrams, associate dean of graduate medical education at Rush.\n\nIt's possible that approach could leave Rush with last-minute vacancies. Abrams estimates about 10 percent of Rush's residents attended medical school in other countries and about 10 of its current residents and fellows are from the seven countries in question.\n\nStill, if Rush accepts residents that ultimately aren't able to make it to the U.S. in time to begin their residencies because of the ban, Rush would hope to hold their spots until they can travel to the U.S., he said.\n\n\"After the executive order went out, we made it very, very clear and I made it very clear to all our program directors here and our trainees here that we were going to do nothing differently,\" Abrams said. \"I've been here 30 years and this is our family, and the people who come here, they're part of our family.\"\n\nHe just hopes those residents feel the same way.\n\nSome doctors and health care leaders fear even the prospect of a ban could scare young foreign doctors away from the U.S. for years to come.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Lisa Schencker", "type": "article"}
