Administration lawyers said such a ruling was essential until the government can draft adequate protections to keep possible terrorists out of the country.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing on the government\u2019s bid to reinstate it drew an extraordinary level of public attention.\n\nThe audio feed was broadcast live on CNN and MSNBC \u2014 highly unusual for a legal teleconference. Nearly 137,000 people listened in on the court\u2019s website, the largest audience \u201cby far\u201d of any hearing since the 9th Circuit began streaming two years ago, a court spokesman said.\n\nThe states of Washington and Minnesota have challenged the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s executive order, arguing that it was motivated by a negative attitude toward Muslims, not a reasoned attempt to protect the country. They said it would prevent students from finishing their education and leave employers suddenly without needed workers.\n\nThe Justice Department counters that the moratorium was not aimed at any particular religion, but at nations associated with terrorism, and is intended to apply only until new vetting measures are in place. Federal attorneys contend that the potential harm cited by the states \u2014 business loss, reduced tax revenue and disruption of higher education \u2014 are merely speculative.\n\nAppeals court arguments are often hard to judge; lawyers for both sides came in for pointed questioning.\n\nBut two of the three 9th Circuit judges hearing the case said little to indicate they would rule for Trump.\n\nOn the other hand, Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush, directed his toughest questions to Washington state Solicitor Gen. Noah G. Purcell, who represented his state and Minnesota during the hearing.\n\nClifton repeatedly noted that the moratorium on entry from the seven targeted nations affected only 15% of the world\u2019s Muslim population. He asked how that amounted to discrimination against Muslims.\n\n\u201cI have trouble understanding where we\u2019re supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,\u201d he said.\n\nClifton also asked whether the administration should be prohibited, under the judge\u2019s order, from applying a ban to people in those seven countries who have never been to the U.S. or held visas.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this over-broad?\u201d Clifton asked, referring to U.S. District Judge James Robart\u2019s temporary restraining order.\n\nThe panel seemed to agree, however, that the states had the legal right to challenge Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAnd both Judge William Canby, an appointee of President Carter, and Judge Michelle Friedland, a President Obama appointee, appeared to come to the aid of the states\u2019 lawyer when Clifton pressed him for evidence that the travel order was motivated by religious bias.\n\n\u201cYou have actually supported these allegations with exhibits, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Friedland reminded the lawyer representing Washington and Minnesota.\n\nCanby quickly added that it was the federal government, not the states, that had the burden of showing its arguments would eventually prevail.\n\nAugust Flentje, special counsel to the assistant U.S. attorney general, argued that Trump\u2019s order merely put a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d on entry from the seven countries until security concerns could be reviewed.\n\nHe said those nations were targeted because Congress and the Obama administration determined they posed special risks of terrorism.\n\nBut Clifton said the administration had only \u201cpretty abstract\u201d evidence that irreparable harm would result if the temporary restraining order were not removed.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like there haven\u2019t been processes in place\u201d to provide extra screening of visa applications from those countries, he said.\n\n\u201cIs there any reason for us to think there is a real risk?\u201d Clifton asked.\n\nFriedland asked the federal government\u2019s lawyer how the administration would view an order that said all Muslims were banned.\n\nFlentje tried to deflect the question but eventually conceded that such an directive could be challenged on constitutional grounds.\n\nUC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky said he was struck by the difficulty the federal lawyer had in providing evidence that removing the hold would cause irreparable harm.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Law Professor Arthur Hellman said he was surprised at the tone of some of some of Clifton\u2019s questions for the Washington state attorney.\n\n\u201cHe seemed almost angry,\u201d Hellman said. \u201cBut later he was also a little hard on the federal government attorney.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Maura Dolan, Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
