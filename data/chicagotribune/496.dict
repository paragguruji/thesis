He decided against leaving in December so he could finish up his studies to become a doctor before traveling here, she said.\n\nBut when Trump signed his executive order Jan. 27 stopping refugee settlement for 120 days and banning Syrian refugees indefinitely, it made the future uncertain, she said.\n\n\"He is worried very much now about his family's future because (he planned) to see his wife and his daughter and live with us again,\" Birkdar said.\n\nRefugees, agency representatives and others provided similar accounts, not only of separated families but of families who had spent years preparing to immigrate and will, for now, not be able to do so.\n\nRefugeeOne, which says it has helped more than 16,000 refugees fleeing many world crises, said its agency alone has pending cases for 307 refugees. Those refugees have been \"fully vetted and were simply awaiting their final travel arrangements,\" the agency said.\n\nDr. Taylor Brinton, a senior resident at Advocate Christ Medical Center, discusses fellow resident Dr. Amer Al Homssi, who was detained after traveling to the United Arab Emirates to be wed. Dr. Homssi will now be allowed to return to the United States without hassle because he filed a lawsuit in which a judge declared the order unconstitutional.

He said the entire family was happy and excited when they first learned they had the opportunity to come to the United States.\n\n\"This was the land of freedom, the land of democracy,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Khalaf, his daughter is currently living in a hotel in Istanbul.\n\nKano called the U.S. refugee program \"a humanitarian program and not one of discrimination.\"\n\n\"Nations are judged by how they treat the most vulnerable \u2014 the widow, the orphan and the refugee,\" she said.\n\nBirkdar said she doesn't understand the justification for the indefinite ban on immigration from Syria where she said people so desperately need refuge.\n\n\"We come here because we are looking for peace, which we missed in our country,\" she said. \"We are Muslims, we are not terrorists. We come here to continue our lives \u2014 to study, to work, to support, to contribute to the people in this country.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Mike Isaacs", "type": "article"}
