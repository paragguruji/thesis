A cautionary tale ensued.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders suspending immigration from seven majority Muslim countries is not playing well to a broader audience with different values, despite likely support from a NASCAR fan base that traditionally skews conservative.\n\nEarnhardt\u2019s comments came in response to a tweet directed at him by @GelarBudidarma, who identified himself as Muslim.\n\n\u201cmy fam immigrated from Germany in 1700s escaping religious persecution. America is created by immigrants.,\u201d Earnhardt tweeted.\n\n\u201cthank you for speaking up, I know a lot of folks in the country look up to you,\u201d @GelarBudidarma, who is from Bandung, Indonesia, tweeted back,\n\nIt is not the salvo to end salvos, but Earnhardt\u2019s voice definitely matters, He has been voted NASCAR\u2019s most popular driver 14 years in a row, despite missing half of last season with concussion-related symptoms.\n\nHe also has 1.9 million Twitter followers.\n\nEarnhardt\u2019s views are his own, and aren\u2019t necessarily reflective of the entire NASCAR Nation. Brian France, NASCAR\u2019s top executive, endorsed Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, drawing criticism in a sport that has made diversity a priority.\n\nFrance, NASCAR's chairman and CEO, said at the time: \u201cHe wins with his family. Any of his children, you'd be proud of have them as part of your family. That's how I judge a winner, how somebody manages their family and raises their family.\u201d\n\nOther NASCAR stars, including retired driver Mark Martin, endorsed Trump.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "George Diaz", "type": "article"}
