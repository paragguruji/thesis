Later the group made its way back toward the White House, shutting down Pennsylvania Avenue. By evening, an impromptu Catholic Mass brought hundreds more to the lawn to resist Trump's order.\n\nAmong the protesters was Shohreh Rahnama, of Bethesda, Md., whose 5-year old son was detained for several hours at Dulles Airport following a flight from Istanbul on Saturday night.\n\nArtiman Jalali was born in the United States and has dual citizenship with Iran. He was traveling back from a visit with relatives with his cousin, 25-year old Aida Mohammadi, a student at University of Maryland and a green card holder.\n\nRahnama said she waited for hours at the airport, with friends and family and a growing crowd of strangers who came to support them and others whose loved ones were detained. They were finally released around midnight. \"He was hungry and he was thirsty, and I could not see him,\" she said.\n\n\"How can a five-year old be banned? Just because his parents are Iranian? We are American too,\" she said. \"I almost died in that airport. I can say it was the worst day of my life.\"\n\nSunday morning, she brought her son and other family members to join the protest at Trump's door step. She wanted to send a message.\n\n\"I am here to say: You cannot do this. You are our servant. The people elected you,\" she said. \"Other countries are thirsty for the rights we have in America. We can't become a dictatorship.\"\n\nTrump reaffirmed the order in a statement Sunday, saying it did not constitute a \"Muslim ban\" and compared it to President Obama's 2011 action blocking visas for Iraqi refugees for six months. Trump said he intends to prioritize persecuted Christians in the Middle East for admission as refugees, and in a weekend television interview former New York mayor Rudy W. Giuliani said Trump wanted a \"Muslim ban\" and asked him to assemble a commission with the knowledge to institute one \"legally.\"\n\nThe travel ban bars entry into the United States from seven predominately Muslim countries. Despite a federal judge's ruling late Saturday, and similar court decisions with varying degrees of power, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Sunday that it would continue to implement order.\n\nProtesters rally at LAX\n\nDemonstrators also gathered Sunday morning at the U.S. Capitol to protest Trump's education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. At least one demonstrator was equipped for both protests, carrying a poster board that addressed one of the issues on each side.\n\nMeanwhile Sunday afternoon, several U.S. congressmen squared off with authorities at Dulles Airport trying to get information on the identities and status of detainees.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Don Beyer and Gerald E. Connolly, both of Virginia, and Jamie B. Raskin of Maryland, were followed by a crowd to a hallway that led toward internal offices where they believed customs officials were located.\n\nConnolly pressed an airport police officer to get a Customs and Border Protection official to meet with the group.\n\nWhile squeezed up against the narrow hallway Connolly challenged the officer.\n\n\"Are people being detained?\" Connolly asked the officer, J. Damskey, a member of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority police. \"How can you enforce the law if you're not enforcing a judge's order?\"\n\nConnolly was handed a cellphone. On the line was a Customs and Border Protection congressional affairs official. Connolly asked for information on possible detainees, including those traveling on a flight from Turkey from which airline customers reported some passengers had been pulled. No one on site from CBP would meet with the congressmen.\n\n\"That is unacceptable. It is our understanding you are detaining people . . . Our understanding is you have not followed that order,\" Connolly said.\n\nConnolly said that a lawyer for one of his constituents was allowed to communicate with his client late Saturday night, and that the person was released.\n\nVirginia immigration attorney Sharifa Abbasi was among the lawyers on hand at Dulles Sunday pressing for information on passengers potentially detained under the executive order.\n\nAbbasi asked a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent for information on who is currently detained at the airport. She pointed to an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, which says lawyers must have access to U.S. green card holders detained under Trump's measure.\n\nAbbasi said she was turned away.\n\n\"They won't give us any information,\" she said.\n\nInside the airport, hundreds of peaceful demonstrators sang the \"National Anthem\" and created a cheering gauntlet for travelers emerging from Customs.\n\nThe crowd yelled \"Let them in!\" and \"Welcome!\" as passengers, including some from majority-Muslim countries, rolled their suitcases through gray doors and into a section of the airport that had become a makeshift law office and civics classroom in response to Trump's executive order.\n\n\"My kids go to school with people from everywhere,\" said Sasha Moreno, of Reston, Va., whose six-year-old daughter drew a little red statue of liberty on poster board along with the message: \"Welcome to America.\"\n\nHer daughter's kindergarten class includes many students from Sudan, one of the countries targeted by Trump's order, which has brought a sense of anxiety in her own family. The idea that her daughter's friends' grandparents would be barred from visiting the United States just because of who they are is unacceptable, and she wants her children to know that's not what America stands for, Moreno said.\n\n\"There are lots of Muslim students at her school. Hearing this stuff going on is really confusing\" to them, Moreno said. \"We like the idea of them having friends from everywhere.\"\n\nDowntown, protesters lined Pennsylvania Avenue and filled out Lafayette Square. They cycled through a variety of chants, and wielded poster boards bearing messages such as \"Islamophobia is un-American\" and \"Dissent is patriotic.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Faiz Siddiqui, Michael Laris, Michael Alison Chandler", "type": "article"}
