Comey is set to testify about the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community that Russian spy agencies used cyberattacks and other tactics to influence the presidential race. He'll likely get questions about whether the FBI is currently investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nLawmakers are also expected to ask Comey whether the FBI conducted wiretapping or other secret surveillance of Trump or his associates before or after the 2016 election\n\nTrump has been under fire for tweets that accused President Obama, without evidence, of wiretapping Trump's phones during the campaign.\n\nThe Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \"there never was\" a wiretap at Trump Tower. Other congressional leaders of both parties have similarly debunked Trump's accusation.\n\nNunes also said he has seen \u201cno evidence of collusion\u201d between Russia and Trump or Trump's associates.\n\nEarlier in this month, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he could deny that he'd seen any evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\"James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia,\" Trump wrote Monday, referring himself by an acronym for President of the United States. \"This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!\"\n\nA few minutes later, Trump wrote another tweet, saying: \"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign.\"\n\nBut several of Trump's campaign staff and close associates had contacts with Russian officials. Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, for example, had direct contacts with Russia's ambassador in Washington and was paid tens of thousands of dollars by a state-owned Russian television channel.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
