Orrick does not sit on that court, but his district is in the territory of the appeals court, which has ruled against one version of Trump's travel ban.\n\n\"The idea that an agency can't put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these moneys are spent is something that will be overturned eventually, and we will win at the Supreme Court level at some point,\" Priebus said.\n\nBoth city and county officials in Chicago said the judge\u2019s ruling supports their position of backing sanctuary city policies.\n\n\u201cWe filed briefs in support of both cases and will continue to work with our governmental partners throughout the U.S. to ensure that we are not illegally penalized due to our status as a sanctuary county,\u201d said Frank Shuftan, a spokesman for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel issued a statement noting that Chicago, too, joined in a brief in the case and welcomed the ruling.\n\nThe story of Chicago's status as a sanctuary city.

And he said the president himself had called it a \"weapon\" to use against recalcitrant cities.\n\nThe government hasn't cut off any money yet or declared any communities to be sanctuary cities. But the Justice Department sent letters last week warning communities to prove they are in compliance. California was informed it could lose $18.2 million.\n\n\"Sanctuary cities\" is a loosely defined term for jurisdictions that don't comply with immigration authorities.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that the executive order applied narrowly to cities that forbid officials to report people's immigration status to federal authorities. Orrick said it could also be construed to apply to cities that refuse to hold jail inmates for immigration authorities.\n\nThe Trump administration says that sanctuary cities allow dangerous criminals back on the street and that the order is needed to keep the country safe. San Francisco and other sanctuary cities say turning local police into immigration officers erodes the trust that is needed to get people to report crime.\n\nThe order has also led to lawsuits by Seattle; two Massachusetts cities, Lawrence and Chelsea; and a third San Francisco Bay Area government, the city of Richmond. The San Francisco and Santa Clara County lawsuits were the first to get a hearing before a judge.\n\nOn Tuesday, mayors from several cities threatened with the loss of federal grants emerged from a meeting with Sessions saying they remain confused about how to prove their police are in compliance with immigration policies.\n\nThe sanctuary city order was among a flurry of immigration measures Trump has signed since taking office in January, including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and a directive calling for a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nA federal appeals court blocked the travel ban. The administration then revised it, but the new version also is stalled in court.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune\u2019s Jeff Coen and Associated Press writer Sadie Gurman contributed to this report.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-25", "authors": "Sudhin Thanawala", "type": "article"}
