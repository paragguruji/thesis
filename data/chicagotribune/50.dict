They gave no date for when the new procedures will start.\n\nIf carriers don\u2019t implement the measures effectively, Homeland Security still may ban laptops, e-readers and other electronic devices larger than cell phones from cargo holds as well as passenger cabins.\n\nThe decision follows intelligence, reportedly gathered from Islamic State in Syria by Israeli spy services, suggesting a lethal new threat from bombs that could be concealed in digital devices and that could evade detection by airport screening devices.\n\nIn March, U.S. and British authorities banned laptops in cabins on flights from eight Muslim-majority countries in North Africa and the Middle East, saying terrorists were seeking \u201cinnovative methods\u201d to bring down commercial jetliners.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told a security conference in Washington on Wednesday that the new security measures will be \u201cboth seen and unseen\u201d and will be phased in over time.\n\nHe said they will include tougher screening, particularly of electronic devices, plus new technology and procedures to protect planes from so--called insider attacks by airline employees.\n\n\u201cIt is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe cannot play international whack-a-mole with every new threat.\u201d\n\nHe said terrorists still see commercial aircraft as \u201cthe crown jewel target\u201d for attacks, and that intelligence has shown renewed interest by terrorists to attack airlines.\n\nKelly told a House committee several weeks ago that the department was considering extending the laptop ban to 71 more airports overseas.\n\nBut Kelly ultimately decided to tighten screening across the board, instead of focusing on laptops or \u201cchasing after each item\u201d that might be used to bring down a jetliner, senior Homeland Security officials said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said Kelly worked with airlines to find ways to improve screening without unduly inconveniencing passengers.\n\n\u201cIntensive doesn\u2019t always mean slower,\u201d said one official. \u201cIn some cases, airlines have been doing these things at international airports for some time.\u201d\n\nThe officials said more security dogs, which sniff for explosives, may be used. And they said airlines and airports may institute pre-check programs like those approved by the Transportation Security Administration for use in U.S. airports.\n\nThe officials said restrictions on the first 10 airports will be lifted once airlines in those countries satisfy the new security protocols, officials said.\n\nAirport authorities in the eight countries affected by that ban \u2013 Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have been told about the new security measures and will put them in place so the ban is lifted, the officials said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kelly and his aides have huddled with their counterparts overseas, as well as with representatives of major airlines, to discuss whether to expand the ban around the globe.\n\nAirlines protested that a laptop ban would inconvenience passengers and not remove the threat. Aviation experts and European security officials warned that putting laptops in cargo holds would pose other dangers because the lithium batteries could start fires.\n\nIn 1988, a bomb hidden in a radio cassette player exploded aboard a Pan Am jet flying over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 passengers and crew. The plot was blamed on then-Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi.\n\nIn 2010, powerful bombs hidden in printer ink cartridges were found aboard two cargo jets headed from Yemen to Chicago. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula later claimed responsibility for the plot.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "Joseph Tanfani", "type": "article"}
