The president also limited the attendance of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence to an as-needed basis at the panel\u2019s meetings.\n\n\u201cStone-cold crazy,\u201d tweeted Susan Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, sarcastically asking, \u201cWho needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?\u201d using acronyms for Islamic State and North Korea.\n\nAnother top Trump aide, Stephen Miller, effectively ran the National Security Council principals meeting Saturday, according to two Trump administration officials, a highly unusual move. Miller was a major architect of the refugee and visa ban.\n\nThe guiding hands of Bannon and Miller \u2014 \"my two Steves,\" as Trump has affectionately called them \u2014 who are only occasionally heard from publicly but almost constantly seen alongside Trump, were evident in much of the developments at the White House in Trump\u2019s first week.\n\nBannon, the former head of the far-right website Breitbart News, once said his goal was to \u201cbring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\u2019s establishment.\u201d Trump made clear through a series of acts in his first week that he intends to upend government policy, not only on reassessing the refugee program but directives to build a wall along the border with Mexico and changes on environmental, healthcare and other issues.\n\nMiller, who developed detailed knowledge of the nation's immigration laws while working on the staff of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, spent much of Saturday making policy decisions based on a strict interpretation of the immigration order and instructing senior Homeland Security officials on how to implement the plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s orders for stopping travelers from seven countries, blocking Syrian refugees and banning all refugee admissions for 120 days were pushed through at breakneck pace instead of what is usually a careful process of review by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies for major changes to immigration policy. Instead, Homeland Security officials were given little time to review the order before it was made public.\n\nOn one of the order\u2019s most controversial and confusing parts, the status of permanent residents, Bannon and Miller at one point overruled an interpretation by Homeland Security officials in favor of a more limited policy that blocked green card holders until they apply for a waiver from the ban, the officials said.\n\nAfter a weekend of conflicting instructions to border officials at airports, the administration said late Sunday that green card holders would not be affected by Trump\u2019s order. About 170 permanent residents from the banned countries had applied for waivers to enter by Sunday afternoon, and all had been granted, a senior administration official said.\n\nAfter chaotic scenes at airport terminals across the country and multiple court orders limiting Trump\u2019s directives, the White House defended the rollout of the policy. The implementation was done \u201cseamlessly\u201d and with \u201cextraordinary professionalism,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters Sunday, adding that the court orders had not undermined the policy\u2019s \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cpurpose.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s top spokesman, Sean Spicer, also defended Trump\u2019s decision to expand Bannon\u2019s reach, telling ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that Trump is simply trying to \u201cstreamline\u201d decision-making and cut bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cHe's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,\u201d Spicer said of Bannon, noting that he is a former naval officer and adding that it\u2019s only right for the president\u2019s top strategist to \u201ccome in and talk about what the strategy is going forward.\u201d\n\nBannon\u2019s and Miller\u2019s increasing power potentially portends a new era of political calculus being applied to decisions on how to deploy American spies and soldiers overseas. Former President George W. Bush kept his powerful strategist Karl Rove out of the Situation Room, where National Security Council meetings are usually held, Joshua Bolten, a White House chief of staff under Bush, said at a conference in September at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Texas.\n\n\u201cThe signal he wanted to send to the rest of his administration, the signal he wanted to send to the public, and the signal he especially wanted to send to the military is that the decisions I'm making that involve life and death for the people in uniform will not be tainted by any political decisions,\u201d Bolten said of Bush.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
