It will include public protests against the ban, delaying Cabinet confirmations and an attempt to reject Trump's pick to serve on the Supreme Court, an announcement expected Tuesday.\n\nThe plans represent a sharp pivot in Democratic strategy after weeks of vowing to work with Trump and Republicans in areas of agreement - and to allow noncontroversial nominees to be quickly confirmed.\n\nBut \"then Trump shredded the Constitution,\" said one senior aide familiar with ongoing strategy talks who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We should be using our time on the floor to talk about the dangerous consequences to U.S. national security by this executive order, we shouldn't be rushing through any confirmation votes this week,\" said Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn.\n\n\"We can take a pause in confirmation votes to try to get this executive order right. You know this is going to get Americans killed if we don't take our time to understand what this order is and what it's consequences are,\" he added.\n\nTrump's ban also significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill complaining angrily Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued.\n\nAt least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump's order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban does not amount to a \"religious test.\" And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored written statements expressing concerns about the order.\n\nBut others spoke out more forcefully. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Monday that he was not briefed before the order was signed.\n\n\"I know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill - not in our office,\" said Corker.\n\nThe disarray over Trump's fulfillment of a core campaign promise underscored the increasingly strained relationship between the new White House and the Republican congressional majority. It comes after a rocky first week and a half punctuated by confusion over health care and tax reform, as well as frustration with the president obsessing over crowd size and his loss of the popular vote in November.\n\nAsked if he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Tex., the number two Republican in the Senate said simply: \"I wasn't.\"\n\nPressed on when he first learned about the order, Corker answered that it was Friday, after it was signed. \"I guess one of you guys probably told me about it - thank you for that,\" Corker told reporters.\n\nPolitico reported Monday night that senior House Judiciary Committee staffers helped Trump's team draft the executive order without informing party leadership. A committee aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in a statement following the report: \"Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law. However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll out and implementation.\"\n\nOn Monday evening, Senate Democrats sought to quickly pass legislation that would rescind Trump's ban, but there was insufficient GOP support.\n\nConfirmation delays began as well, when Democrats blocked a committee from meeting to approve Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, to the full Senate. The Senate Finance Committee is now expected to consider the former Goldman Sachs banker on Tuesday, at the same time it will vote to approve the nomination of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAmid the Democratic outcry, Trump and his aides strongly defended the ban and faulted Democrats for trying to \"obstruct\" his Cabinet nominees.\n\n\"We actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security,\" Trump said at a White House event. During a meeting with small business leaders, he blasted Democrats for delaying the confirmation of his nominees \"for political reasons. Just politics.\"\n\nBut it remained unclear just how united Democrats would remain. On Monday, the Senate voted on a key procedural step toward the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with three members of the Democratic caucus supporting him - Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D, Angus King, I-Maine, Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Mark Warner, D-Va.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she didn't think there would be further delays of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as attorney general; and it was unclear whether Democrats would succeed in delaying a hearing Tuesday for Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services.\n\nCommittees are also scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to serve as interior secretary; and GOP powerbroker Betsy DeVos to serve as education secretary.\n\nHow far Democrats go will be closely watched by the liberal activists who joined them to protest Trump's ban Monday night on the steps of the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter the sun set, and Democrats made their way from the Capitol, chants of \"hands too small, can't build a wall\" and \"build a fence around Mike Pence\" alternated with \"walk the walk!\" - a command to the Democrats themselves.\n\nAnd when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the crowd, \"What the president did is not constitutional,\" one protester retorted: \"You're not doing anything if you don't stop Sessions!\"\n\nMeanwhile, statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.\n\n\"There were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved,\" Spicer told reporters at a briefing. He refused to specify which if any committees were involved in the decision-making.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Ed O'Keefe, Sean Sullivan, Kelsey Snell", "type": "article"}
