Bush on Wednesday pushed back at the notion that his recent remarks about the media were criticisms of President Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asked the question, \u2018Do I believe in free press?\u2019 and the answer is absolutely, I believe in free press \u2026 because the press holds people to account,\u201d he said. \u201cPower is very addictive and it's corrosive if it becomes central to your life and therefore there needs to be an independent group of people who hold you to account. And so I answered that question and of course the headlines were, \u2018Bush criticizes Trump.\u2019 And so therefore I needed to say, \u2018There should be a free and independent press, but it ought to be accurate.\u2019\u201d\n\nBush made the remarks at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley during an hourlong question-and-answer session promoting \u201cPortraits of Courage,\" his new book that features his paintings of veterans. While doing media interviews about the book in recent days, he has raised eyebrows by making comments about the media, immigrants and allegations of Russian interference in the November presidential election that were widely viewed as criticisms of the new president.\n\nHe said that he decided once he left the office not to second-guess his successor, former President Obama, and that the same holds true for Trump. Doing so would undermine the office, Bush said, adding that he wants all of his successors to succeed because it is good for the nation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make the president\u2019s job worse, no matter what political party it is. It\u2019s a hard job,\u201d Bush said. \u201cSometimes my remarks can be construed as criticism. They\u2019re certainly not meant to be, and after I finish this book tour you probably won\u2019t hear from me for a while.\u201d\n\nBut he was willing to offer advice to those who follow him.\n\n\u201cKnow what you don\u2019t know and find people who do know what you don\u2019t know and listen to them,\u201d he said. \u201cMy advice is that the job is different once you get in. It looks one way and then you get in the Oval Office and it looks different. Trust me.\u201d\n\nBush also made an implicit criticism of Obama\u2019s foreign policy when asked whether the world is more dangerous than it was four years ago.\n\n\u201cThis may be taken as criticism of one of my successors and I don\u2019t really mean it to be. There is a lesson however when the United States decides not to take the lead and withdraw,\u201d he said. \u201cVacuums can be created when U.S. presence recedes and that vacuum is generally filed with people who don\u2019t share the ideology, the same sense of human rights and human dignity and freedom that we do.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
