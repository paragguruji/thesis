So brace yourselves, Americans. Any day now, the Syrian government may impose a complete and total shutdown on travelers from the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered a similar ban because he thinks there is a pipeline of violent extremists from Syria and other predominantly Muslim countries. He's right, but he's wrong about the direction of the flow. Islamic State recruits aren't coming from Syria to the United States. They are going from the United States to Syria.\n\nNora Ellingsen, who spent five years working on international counterterrorism investigations at the FBI, went through all the cases she could find over the past two years. Over that time, the agency \"has arrested 34 Americans who aspired to leave, attempted to leave or actually left the United States to join a terrorist group overseas,\" she writes \u2014 compared with two refugees it has arrested from the seven countries included in Trump's travel ban.\n\nA report from Congress found that 250 U.S. nationals have gone to Syria or Iraq to fight for the Islamic State group, also known as ISIL and ISIS. \"More Americans have snuck into Syria to join ISIL,\" she writes on the Lawfare blog, \"than ISIL members have snuck into the United States.\"\n\nIn ruling against the president's executive order, a panel of three judges for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals couldn't help noticing that \"the government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\" Now we know why.\n\nThe Trump administration portrays itself as the Dutch boy with his finger in the dike, trying to block a flood of militants disguised as Syrian kindergartners. John Kelly, secretary of homeland security, explained the abruptness of the travel ban: \"The thinking was to get it out quick so that, potentially, people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane.\"\n\nEven before the ban, though, Syrians couldn't just claim to be refugees and proceed to the airport. They had to spend 18 to 24 months being screened and processed. It's not an option for someone in a hurry.\n\nKelly also left out the large, honking fact that the danger Americans face is less from without than from within. That's clear from a new study done by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"The American Face of ISIS\" examines 112 cases of people known to have been involved in \"ISIS-related offenses\" \u2014 including carrying out attacks, plotting them, traveling to take part in them or helping other confederates. It reports that 83 percent are U.S. citizens, with 65 percent born here. None came as a refugee from Syria.\n\nOnly three of the 112 were refugees, two from Bosnia and one from Iraq. CPOST Director Robert Pape said the researchers found \"no evidence of ISIS smuggling fighters into the United States alongside with refugees.\"\n\nSniffing out incoming terrorists among those arriving from these nations is like scouting for future NHL stars in Jamaica. In the past two years, Ellingsen says, the FBI has arrested more Americans plotting violent attacks on Muslims in the U.S. than it has refugees from all the banned countries combined.\n\nSkittish sorts may figure it's better to be safe than sorry. But the travel ban doesn't enhance our safety even marginally. Just the opposite.\n\nMiddle Eastern terrorists figured out long ago it was too hard to get their people into this country. What is easy is transmitting propaganda. As Pape points out, \"ISIS terrorists in America are walk-in volunteers\" \u2014 people living in the U.S. who have been radicalized by its online videos.\n\nWhat the travel ban does, by singling out Muslims in these seven countries, is to buttress the Islamic State claim that the West is at war with Islam. If the policy induces a small percentage of American Muslims \u2014 who number 3.3 million \u2014 to embrace the group, the risk of terrorism will multiply.\n\nTrump thinks he can protect the nation by blocking the arrival of foreigners with murderous plans. The bigger danger is that the Islamic State will enlist more Americans in its bloody cause. And Trump may be the best recruiter it has ever had.\n\nSteve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/chapman.\n\nschapman@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @SteveChapman13\n\nRelated articles:\n\nTrump properties: 264 potential soft targets for terror attacks\n\nFour things to fear now that Jeff Sessions is attorney general\n\nWill Trump's Cabinet challenge Trump?\n\nTrump's travel moratorium: What a hopeless disaster", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Steve Chapman", "type": "article"}
