The report was commissioned by the U.S. Travel Assn., the trade group for the nation\u2019s travel industry.\n\nThe report calculates an index that represents travel volume in the U.S., both international and domestic. Any score on the index above 50 represents growth. A score below 50 is a decline. For the six-month period ended July 31, the report ranked the domestic U.S. travel market at 51.4, while the international market was ranked at 49.4.\n\nAdam Sacks, president of Oxford Economics, said stagnant wages and the fear that Trump may fail to make good on his campaign promises could jeopardize future domestic travel growth.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the president\u2019s continued rhetoric and policies weigh heavily on the intentional inbound market outlook,\u201d Sacks added.\n\nA report issued last week by the International Air Transport Assn, the trade group for the world\u2019s airlines, warned that international travel in North America appears to be weakening, but it did not blame Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cAnecdotal evidence suggests that inbound demand is being negatively influenced by the additional security measures in place for travel to the US,\u201d the report said.\n\nhugo.martin@latimes.com\n\nTo read more about the travel and tourism industries, follow @hugomartin on Twitter.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-11", "authors": "Hugo Martin", "type": "article"}
