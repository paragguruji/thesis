Ryan and his lieutenants are still working overtime to secure additional commitments from Republicans, particularly among the members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, to get to a majority.\n\nIf the bill passes, it would move on to the Senate with a goal of enacting legislation before the Easter recess, although many senators have expressed doubts that the process can move that quickly in their chamber.\n\nTrump told House members that after promising voters for years that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have little choice but to vote for the bill before them. He singled out a leader of the Freedom Caucus and early campaign supporter of his, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, to encourage him to come on board.\n\n\u201cBecause honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks,\u201d Trump said, according to sources present for the discussion.\n\n\u201cThe president was very direct. We get this done, and tax reform, he believes we pick up 10 seats in the Senate, and we add to our majority in the House,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), another longtime Trump backer. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get it done, we lose the House, and we lose the Senate.\u201d\n\nRepublicans largely called the discussion upbeat despite the president\u2019s warnings, but there was no mistaking the uncertainty surrounding the final outcome. Trump wasn\u2019t making political threats, but clearly laying out the consequences, attendees said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was here to do what he does best, and that is to close the deal,\u201d Ryan said afterward. \u201cI think our members are beginning to appreciate just what kind of a rendezvous with destiny we have right here.\u201d\n\nSeveral leading conservative members, though, remained on the fence, even after the hard sell.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a member of the Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers from the group opposed the bill ahead of the morning meeting, but Trump\u2019s all-in warnings were a \u201cselling point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said Griffith, who was leaning in favor. \u201cHe was very personal, and he said we need to work together as a team ... but that we have to stick together or else this will fall apart and the American people will lose confidence that we can get things done.\n\n\u201cIt is a selling point,\u201d he added. \u201cFor some of my friends, you have to get a little bit more conservative in the bill in order to get them to feel comfortable with it.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
