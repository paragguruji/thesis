Ryan's defense and McConnell's silence, some critics said, amounted to a moral failing that made them complicit in a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on Twitter along with the famous image of a toddler boy who had died in 2015 while his family fled Syria and whose body had washed up on Turkey's shore.\n\nThe order blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya from entering the country for at least 90 days. It also bans refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days - and from Syria indefinitely. Trump said the goal is to screen out \"radical Islamic terrorists\" and to give priority for admission to Christians.\n\nRepublicans defending the executive order pointed to an exception for people already in transit and argued that some elements, including the religious minority preference, would not immediately be implemented. But as cable news footage brought scenes Saturday of chaos at airports around the country, where business travelers, students and even legal U.S. residents were being barred entry, other Republicans began weighing in.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. \"I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.\"\n\nDent, who represents a large Syrian community in the Allentown area, said he was contacted Saturday by a constituent whose family members were turned away early in the morning at Philadelphia International Airport. Six family members who had secured visas and even bought a house in Pennsylvania arrived on a Qatar Airways flight but were turned back within hours, he said.\n\nDent called on the Trump administration to immediately halt action on the order.\n\n\"This family was sent home despite having all their paperwork in order,\" Dent said. \"So this 90-day ban could imperil the lives of this family and potentially others, and it's unacceptable, and I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be reinstated.\"\n\nSome conservatives worried that denying entry to permanent residents and green-card holders could violate the Constitution. Many worried privately that the order will face significant challenges in court. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., was among the few GOP members to air his concerns publicly. Amash posted on Twitter that the order \"overreaches\" and \"undermines\" the Constitution.\n\n\"It's not lawful to ban immigrants on basis of nationality,\" he tweeted. \"If the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., credited Trump with properly focusing on protecting the country's borders and said it is necessary to connect \"jihadi terrorism\" with Islam and particular countries. However, he also noted that the order is \"too broad.\"\n\n\"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said. \"Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he has \"technical\" questions about how the order will be implemented but supports its purpose.\n\nThe statement from Ryan's office came after several requests seeking comment on how the order differs from the Muslim ban that Ryan rejected during the campaign, whether such a ban is in line with American values and if Ryan is concerned that the order is a first step toward a religious litmus test.\n\nRyan has been a consistent advocate for increased vetting standards and has frequently said he opposes a complete ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\n\"Freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle. It's a founding principle of this country,\" Ryan told reporters following a closed-door morning meeting at the Republican National Committee in December 2015. \"This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it's not what this country stands for.\"\n\nThe majority of Republicans in Congress were silent on the order Saturday - including McConnell. Calls and emails to more than a dozen top GOP lawmakers were not returned.\n\nConservative advocacy groups, meanwhile, generally supported Trump's actions.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Kelsey Snell, Karoun Demirjian, Mike Debonis", "type": "article"}
