{"title": "In Allentown's Syrian community, a divide over Trump's travel ban", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/mc-allentown-syrians-react-to-trump-20170130-story.html", "text": "The working-class streets of Allentown's sixth and first wards have long welcomed Syrian immigrants, many of whom traveled here from villages in Wadi al-Nasara, a small Christian enclave near the country's border with Lebanon.\n\nAs early as the 1880s, some came to escape oppression or with the help of missionaries, others later because they had relatives here, finding work over generations as peddlers, merchants and in the region's quarries, cement or silk mills, and at Bethlehem Steel.\n\nThe earliest documented arrival of Arab immigrants to the Lehigh Valley was in 1893, when George and Aziz Atiyeh, brothers from Syria, came to Bethlehem. It took more than a month to get to the United States by steamship.\n\nLehigh County today has the third-largest population of people of Syrian ancestry in the United States, but the members of that nearly 3,000-strong community are not out in the streets en masse demonstrating against President Donald Trump's executive order freezing immigration from their home country.\n\nThe reality in Allentown's Syrian community is more complex.\n\nFor some, such as Hussein Assaf, Trump's order is a poorly conceived mistake. The Allentown resident said he has family members trapped and starving in war-torn Madaya. He was raised Muslim, but considers himself an agnostic led not by religion, but pragmatism.\n\n\"The so-called Muslim ban is ridiculously stupid. It makes us look like we're at war with Islam, and that will only be used as a recruitment tool,\" said Assaf, an activist who has tried to pressure the American government to get more involved in ending the war in Syria. \"It makes us less secure, not more, and it's counterproductive in every way. This will affect business deals, employment and trade. Everything about it is stupid.\"\n\nBut he is likely in the minority among Lehigh County's predominately Christian Syrian community, many of whom blame Muslim extremists for Syria's extended civil war.\n\nThe basic idea at the heart of Trump's executive order is sound, said the Very Rev. Anthony Sabbagh, pastor of St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Allentown, an anchor of the city's Syrian community. But he thinks it should have been better crafted to avoid the unintended consequences that even have turned away Syrians immigrating with legal paperwork.\n\nWhile Trump's order expresses a preference for allowing members of persecuted religious minorities into the country, the Christian relatives of Allentown resident Sarmad Assali, for example, were among those turned away when the order was hastily implemented over the weekend.\n\n\"Our president has the right to make decisions he believes will make America more secure. I absolutely support that effort,\" Sabbagh said. \"I just wish it had been more thought-out to not get innocent people caught up in it.\"\n\nPHOTO GALLERY: The Very Rev.

Lehigh County is home to more than 3,800 Syrians, ranking it third in the country for Syrian population.

Many came to Syria after fleeing persecution in Turkey and found relative safety under the dictatorial rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Under his regime, Muslims and Christians had managed to coexist until the 2011 uprisings that led to civil war.\n\n\"The Christian community in Syria [broadly speaking] has been supportive of Assad because they fear Islamic fundamentalists taking over the country,\" he said. And they see the opposition forces being dominated by Islamic extremists.\n\nThe country's disastrous civil war has widened the rift between Syria's Christian and Muslim communities, Landis said.\n\nMuslim extremists have slain Christian clerics in areas of the country they control, he said. And when the nearby city of Homs became a battlefield, Muslim refugees, some armed, flooded into Wadi al-Nasara, chasing Christians from their homes.\n\nIn response, Christians raised militias and Assad came to their aid in brutal fashion, Landis said.\n\n\"That was an important point in the war for Christians, because the regime stepped in on their side,\" he said.\n\nThose fresh wounds have followed Syrians across the Atlantic, but they are not universal.\n\nAyoub Jarrouj, president of Allentown's Syrian Arab American Charity Association, a Christian who was once held prisoner by the Assad regime, said extra vetting for people coming from countries that have engaged in terrorism is appropriate, but only to a point. His association provides aid to Syrian refugees to Allentown, including some who are Muslims.\n\n\"I'm fine with pausing 120 days to check visas from those countries,\" Jarrouj said. \"But to say all Muslims should not come, or to stop all Syrian refugees, is very wrong. The Muslims who have come to Allentown are examples to follow. They respect the laws and are loved by their neighbors. [Trump's] gone too far on this one.\"\n\nWhile they have received some help, Muslim refugees coming from Syria in recent years haven't been wholeheartedly embraced by Allentown's Syrian community, said Sherrine Eid, who works with refugees at the Whitehall Township-based Muslim Association of the Lehigh Valley and is not Syrian.\n\nInstead, the region's Muslim community has been their primary source of fellowship and support, she said.\n\nEid said the Trump administration is wrong to target refugees in an effort to protect the country from terrorism.\n\n\"It doesn't make us safer,\" she said. \"We don't know of any refugees that have committed any crimes locally. They are always very grateful for an opportunity to build America. They have heard about the American dream and they want to help build America.\"\n\nAziz Wehbey, president of American Amarian Syrian Charity Society, is a Christian who not only voted for Trump, but campaigned for him in the Syrian community.\n\nWehbey backed Trump in part because he promised to halt the refugee program, but the president's latest order has hit too many unintended targets, he said.\n\nWehbey, a Syrian immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2000, is already upset with his new president.\n\n\"I support redirecting the refugee program, but this has caused chaos for immigrants legally entering this county,\" said Wehbey, who said he has been taking calls from angry and confused friends and relatives in Syria and Lebanon since Saturday. \"Am I now a second-class citizen? This goes against the American way. We don't need Trump the candidate now. We need Trump the president. Fix this.\"\n\nscott.kraus@mcall.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Matt Assad, Scott Kraus", "type": "article"}
