The administration appealed to the nation's highest court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month.\n\nNeal Katyal, the lawyer who argued for the challengers in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, wrote on Twitter, \"Its kinda odd to have the defendant in HawaiivTrump acting as our co-counsel. We don't need the help but will take it!\" He also wrote that he was \"waiting now for the inevitable cover-my-tweet posts from him that the Solicitor General will no doubt insist upon.\"\n\nEven George Conway, a prominent lawyer who recently took himself out of the running to lead the Justice Department's Civil Division and who is the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, posted on Twitter that the remarks might hurt the legal case.\n\n\"These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,\" he wrote, using abbreviations for Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was \"not at all\" concerned that his tweets might muddy the legal case, and his attention was instead on the substance of his executive order. She said she was not aware of any vetting of his tweets by lawyers or aides.\n\n\"The president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that's protecting Americans, protecting national security, and he has every constitutional authority to do that through that executive order and he maintains that, and that position hasn't changed in the slightest,\" Sanders said.\n\nTrump himself indicated late in the day that he had no intention of backing down from his early morning sentiments, tweeting, \"That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!\"\n\nFederal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump's own comments in ordering that the ban be frozen, determining that the president's words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive.\n\nThe majority opinion in the 4th Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump's tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\n\nOmar Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case in the 4th Circuit, wrote that Trump's tweets amounted to \"a promise: let me do this and I'll take it as license to do even worse.\" In an interview, Jadwat said the president's tweets \"seem to undermine the picture the government's been trying to paint.\"\n\n\"I can't say for sure what our brief is going to look like, but this stuff seems relevant,\" Jadwat said.\n\nGovernment lawyers have sought to convince judges that they should not consider the president's statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban. They have also sought to portray the president's words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question - though not all - came before Trump was elected.\n\n\"We shouldn't start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\" acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump's latest tweets - which were later set to dramatic music and posted in a video on his Facebook page - will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump's revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version.\n\nThat version, which unilaterally revoked the visas of tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim-majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was more onerous and had a provision in the text that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \"should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\" to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court.\n\nTrump also wrote that the Justice Department \"should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\" The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; the justices will be weighing whether Trump's order is constitutional.\n\nThe travel ban seems to have been on Trump's mind since the terrorist attack in London on Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\"\n\nLegal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case.\n\n\"In case it's not obvious, these will only undermine the government's case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\" University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \"These will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "Matt Zapotosky", "type": "article"}
