{"title": "ICYMI: A new absurdity from the gun lobby is the deregulation of silencers", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-fi-hiltzik-gun-silencers-20170110-story.html", "text": "As my colleague Lisa Mascaro is reporting Monday, Congressional Republicans are still planning to push through a package of bills sponsored by the National Rifle Assn. aimed at making it easier to purchase silencers. That\u2019s happening even as gun-safety experts observe that silencers might have increased the carnage of Sunday\u2019s Las Vegas Strip massacre, as the sound of gunfire prompted many people to run for cover; suppressing the sound could have left more people exposed to injury for longer, while also making it more difficult for law-enforcement officials to pinpoint the source of the gunfire.\n\nI addressed the silencer issue in the column reprinted below, which originally ran on Jan. 10. I\u2019m reposting it now because of its dismal relevance to current events.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe gun lobby certainly is adept at promoting counterintuitive (and probably counterproductive) policy positions, such as that the answer to gun violence in America is more guns. Politicians certainly are adept at giving their bills titles that conceal their purpose, like calling a bill that narrows privacy rights and constrains civil liberties the \u201cPatriot Act.\u201d\n\nPut these proclivities together, and you get the \u201cHearing Protection Act,\u201d introduced Monday by Reps. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) and John Carter (R-Texas). From the title alone, you\u2019d have no idea that it\u2019s about deregulating the sale of gun silencers.\n\nSilencers are part of the appeal of the militarized firearm. The industry sells them as an add-on. \u2014 \u2014 Kristen Rand, Violence Policy Center\n\nStiff federal regulations on silencers date back to 1934, when they were enacted as part of a crackdown on machine guns and other instruments of mobster violence. (Thanks to the Washington Post\u2019s Michael Rosenwald for some of this history.) In recent years, they\u2019ve stuck in the gun lobby\u2019s craw, as do most restrictions on the sale of firearms and related equipment.\n\nBut treating the use of silencers as a public health issue is a relatively new twist. It was first tried in connection with a precursor bill to the Duncan-Carter measure that was introduced in 2015 and died in committee. The silencer industry also has a new high-profile celebrity endorser: Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter who can be seen in a promotional video for Utah-based SilencerCo.\n\nAdvocates of the measure say silencers, or \u201csuppressors,\u201d to use the preferred industry term, have been given a bad rap by Hollywood and pulp fiction. They says silencers don\u2019t normally reduce the noise of a gunshot to the quiet \u201cthump,\u201d like a fist hitting a pillow, that one hears in James Bond movies, but only enough to stave off hearing loss and allow hunters to hear each other in the wild.\n\nA video featured on the website Bearing Arms (whose editor, Bob Owens, contributed a pro-silencer op-ed to the Los Angeles Times last year) tries to make the case that even with silencers, gunshots fired inside a home remain \u201cdistinct and unmistakable.\u201d Actually, the sound of at least the lower-powered silenced weapons in the clip might be difficult to identify as gunshots; you be the judge.\n\n\u201cSuppressors do not make guns silent or dangerous,\u201d Rep. Carter said in introducing the bill. \u201cThey are simply a form of hearing protection, both for the shooter and their hunting dogs.\u201d\n\nPublic misunderstanding about silencers has made them harder to buy than guns themselves. Under the 1934 National Firearms Act, buyers must specifically register, undergo a federal screening that can take nine months and pay a $200 tax. (The tax hasn\u2019t been raised since the 1930s, when it was deemed high enough to discourage virtually any sales.) Those are the same restrictions governing hand grenades and land mines, though of course there isn\u2019t an industry push to expand sales of those devices. In eight states, including California, New York and Massachusetts, civilian ownership of silencers is banned outright.\n\nManufacturers say it\u2019s illogical to raise a higher bars to silencer purchases than gun purchases, but this is a double-edged sword. They may be right, but that\u2019s an argument for making guns as hard to buy as silencers, rather than the other way around.\n\nGun control advocates don\u2019t buy these pro-silencer arguments and neither should you. The argument that silencer sales promote public health by protecting hearing is a smokescreen, they say, for a deregulatory initiative that would largely benefit the firearms industry while increasing the dangers of firearm violence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of a public health issue associated with hearing loss from gunfire,\u201d says Kristin Brown of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cThere is evidence of a public health crisis from gun violence, and we think that\u2019s where legislative efforts should be directed.\u201d\n\nOthers point to indications that silencers can reduce public awareness of developing firearm attacks and interfere with law enforcement. That appeared to happen in the 2013 Southern California murder rampage of former Los Angeles police Officer Christopher Dorner. As The Times reported, Dorner\u2019s early morning killing of a couple in a parked car in Irvine initially went undetected, even though he loosed 14 gunshots \u2014 apparently with a silenced weapon. Later in the rampage, when Dorner was cornered in the San Bernardino National Forest, his use of a silenced sniper rifle made it difficult for sheriff\u2019s deputies under fire to pinpoint his position.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-10", "authors": "Michael Hiltzik", "type": "article"}
