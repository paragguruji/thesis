As the hosts tell it, the order made a lot of people very angry, but it also brought a lot of people together. At airports, no less!\n\nWe've rounded up some of the memorable late-night commentary about Trump's immigration order and the resulting protests.\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" host Jimmy Kimmel introduces \"Trump TV.\" \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" host Jimmy Kimmel introduces \"Trump TV.\" SEE MORE VIDEOS\n\nJust about everyone made an airport joke.\n\nConan O'Brien: \"This weekend, the nation's airports were filled with people protesting President Trump's Muslim ban. It was the largest collection of angry people at an airport since every United Airlines flight.\"\n\nOn \"The Daily Show\" Trevor Noah asked correspondent Hasan Minhaj, who had recently landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, what he thought of the order.\n\n\"Usually, being a Muslim in an airport sucks,\" Minhaj explained. \"But this weekend, it was like I was The Weeknd. I mean I land at JFK, I get to the arrival section. Literally, three white people run up to me, hug me and say 'thank you for being Muslim.' I'm 31 years old. That's the first time anyone has thanked me for being Muslim.\"\n\n\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert looks at President Donald Trump's first week in office. \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert looks at President Donald Trump's first week in office.

It's Sunday, they have no travel plans, and they go to the airport.\"\n\nJimmy Fallon: \"Here in New York, thousands of people showed up at JFK airport over the weekend to protest Trump's immigration ban. People who were actually at the protest said 'This is awful,' while the people at LaGuardia were like, 'You think you got it bad? We're at LaGuardia.'\"\n\nStephen Colbert: \"Now, all of this is upsetting, if you're one of those people who thought about it. Which is why tens of thousands of protesters spontaneously demonstrated - do you have any idea how angry people have to be to voluntarily go to JFK?\"\n\nSeth Meyers: \"He was detained for 18 hours at JFK and he still loves America,\" the 'Late Night' host said of an Iraqi man who once worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army. \"If you can spend more than two hours at JFK without losing your sh--, you should get automatic citizenship.\"\n\nThere were also 'Finding Dory' jokes. (Trump reportedly held a private screening of the animated film over the weekend).\n\nKimmel: \"While all this was happening, President Trump was hosting a screening at the White House of the movie 'Finding Dory,' which, ironically, is a movie about a fish trying to find her parents. To his credit, he was so moved by the film that he lifted all travel restrictions on clownfish.\"\n\nConan O'Brien: \"Kind of a turbulent weekend, but you should feel good about this, Donald Trump did find time to relax. True story, yesterday, Donald Trump spent the afternoon at the White House watching 'Finding Dory' with his family ... apparently, in this version, Dory couldn't be found because she was being detained at the airport.\"\n\nNoah (in a Trump-esque voice): \"Shhh, don't disturb me I don't care what's happening at the airports. I'm watching a movie about families being separated. It's hilarious.\"\n\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\n\nNoah: \"By the way, who hasn't watched 'Finding Dory' yet?! It's 2017! This man is not fit to be president. Not fit!\"\n\nFallon: \"While all this was going on, yesterday at the White House, Trump hosted a screening of the movie 'Finding Dory.' Trump said he actually related more to 'Finding Nemo' because that was about an orange and white cartoon.\"\n\nThe hosts analyzed how Trump and White House staffers responded to criticism.\n\nColbert: \"Now Trump has responded to criticism that the plan was rushed, tweeting, 'If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!' I don't think President Trump has ever used quotation marks before.\"\n\n\"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon impersonates President Donald Trump. \"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon impersonates President Donald Trump.

And that meant lucky Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had the unenviable job today of trying to explain how to detaining a 5-year-old helps to keep the country safe.\" (Cut to Spicer saying ' ... to assume that someone's age or gender or whatever that they don't pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.') UNLESS THEY'RE 5-YEARS-OLD.\"\n\nColbert: \"At Dulles Airport, a 5-year-old Iranian boy was detained for hours and kept from his mother. Or as Kellyanne Conway calls it, alternative day care.\"\n\nThey suggested that maybe Trump didn't write the executive order after all.\n\nMeyers: \"When Trump first announced the order at a signing ceremony over the weekend, he read it aloud like he was seeing it for the very first time. Hey man, it's not comforting to us when you seem shocked by the stuff you're signing. That's the way people look before they sign the injury waiver on 'American Ninja Warrior.'\"\n\nNoah: \"Hey Donald, I know you don't actually write or read any of those boring papers so let me explain to you what you did. You banned everyone from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. Even though you said your ban was to protect America from outside threats, that ban included people with green cards. It even seemed to include dual citizens of Canada or Britain or any other country you didn't plan to ban, you silly billy.
