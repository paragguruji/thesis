There was the Syrian American worshiper who wondered after the president\u2019s travel ban if she'd ever see her relatives again. There was the young Mexican American near tears after he converted to join the congregation, part of a stream of newcomers. There were the emails and calls thanking Parada for being there at a time when the country\u2019s leader broadly painted immigrants and Muslims as being prone to violence.\n\nTodd Spoth / For The Times Imam Isa Parada of Centro Isl\u00e1mico mosque in Houston.

(Todd Spoth / For The Times)\n\n\"Man, he\u2019s changed everything,\" Parada, a stocky, bearded Salvadoran American, said of President Trump. \u201cIn some ways, he\u2019s turned our world upside-down.\u201d\n\nLast month, Parada became the first full-time imam at Centro Isl\u00e1mico, the nation's only Spanish-speaking mosque. The congregation, which counts among it dozens of Mexican Americans and other converts, serves one of the fastest growing segments of Islam in the U.S.: Latinos.\n\nNow, with the president\u2019s sweeping immigration changes through his travel ban and deportation push, those at Centro Isl\u00e1mico have been affected in ways few imagined when it launched just over a year ago on the far western edge of Houston.\n\nThey\u2019ve also come to play a unique role as a bridge between the nation\u2019s Muslims and Latinos, two groups in the crosshairs of some of the most controversial administration moves. Representatives of both have taken to the streets and courts to battle the White House.\n\n\u201cWhat I try to tell people is that Donald Trump becoming president for us is giving us more confidence as Latino Muslims. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to talk about Islam, to talk about our immigrant stories,\u201d said Parada, 39. \u201cBut we also have to be realistic. You hope it never gets back to what happened to the Japanese.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, there are more than 100,000 Latino Muslims in the U.S. They make up a sliver of the nation\u2019s 3.3 million Muslims and a smaller portion of its 57 million Latinos. They\u2019re concentrated in areas with large Latino populations such as California, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. But the heart of the community is Houston, where occasional Spanish-language services have taken place at traditional mosques for years under the guidance of Islam in Spanish, an educational nonprofit that largely focused on producing online videos and distributing Spanish-language Korans \u2014 until it launched Centro Isl\u00e1mico.\n\nTodd Spoth / For The Times Members of the congregation meet for prayer led by Imam Isa Parada, Friday, March 3, 2017 at Centro Isl\u00e1mico.

A white concrete building with dark, tinted windows, it comes to life inside where walls are decorated with red and white striped patterns reminiscent of the Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba, the famed 10th century Spanish mosque.\n\nArab Muslims ruled Spain for centuries beginning in the Middle Ages, leaving an Islamic influence on culture and language that remains today. It\u2019s a legacy the center\u2019s Muslims point to as part of their shared history.\n\nThe Latino Muslim community in Houston now tops 1,000 Muslims. Dozens show up for Friday congregational prayers, and hundreds come for holiday services at Centro Isl\u00e1mico. Trump\u2019s name has been said perhaps only less than Allah\u2019s and the prophet Muhammad\u2019s at the mosque since its grand opening \u2014 and has become a constant if silent backdrop to part-English, part-Spanish sermons.\n\nBut only recently has the president had a measurable impact as his campaign promises turned into policy.\n\nAfter Trump signed his first executive order pausing refugee resettlement and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, concerns grew among women married to Middle Eastern and African Muslim men.\n\nTodd Spoth / For The Times New member Armando Segura, 28, of Houston, embraces his sister following a short ceremony welcoming him to the congregation March 3 at Centro Isl\u00e1mico mosque in Houston.

(Todd Spoth / For The Times)\n\nSome in the community rallied at Houston\u2019s airport as travelers were detained in a shaky first rollout of the travel ban. Others headed to Austin last month for \u201cTexas Muslim Capitol Day\u201d to plead with lawmakers to aid Muslims such as those whose mosque in Victoria, two hours from Houston, burned to the ground in January.\n\nWhen the Department of Homeland Security announced it would make it easier for immigration agents to arrest and deport those living in the country illegally, stories spread at Centro Isl\u00e1mico of traffic checkpoints and raids at grocery stores. One man is in proceedings to be deported to Mexico. Younger members who are \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 people who enrolled in a program under President Obama that halted deportations of certain immigrants brought to the country as children \u2014 are praying their status continues.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be as \u201cstrange and different\u201d as Latino Muslims, Parada \u2014 who converted 21 years ago from Catholicism after reading about Malcolm X \u2014 told a few dozen congregants during a recent sermon. It\u2019s hard, he said, to be asked by relatives why he doesn\u2019t drink anymore, or be looked at by uncles as if \u201csomething is not normal with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Allah knows this \u2014 he is watching and knows everything \u2014 Islam began as something strange,\u201d he said, telling the crowd to be patient with their friends and relatives, and with the nation. The Latinos in the room could be an example to the city and their workplaces, Parada said, of how in Islam \u201cwomen are equal to men,\u201d of how Islam is a faith of peace and justice.\n\nAfterward, members lingered in a hallway to commiserate over the their place in America. They encouraged each other to be steadfast in faith and spirit.\n\nThey were newer Muslims, ones who long ago converted from Christianity, and those born into the religion. They talked of the pride and sorrow, the joy and pain \u2014 and the humor \u2014 in sitting at the nexus of maligned faith and ethnicity.\n\nTodd Spoth / For The Times Members converse after prayer at Centro Isl\u00e1mico mosque in Houston.
