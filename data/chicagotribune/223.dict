Kennedy International Airport on Monday morning. And though the six Syrian immigrants had cleared customs earlier in Abu Dhabi, Sarmad Assali let out a short cry of relief when she saw the family walk around a corner and into sight.\n\nSarmad Assali and husband, Ghassan Assali, of Allentown waited nine tense days to be reunited with family members who were turned away from Philadelphia International Airport because of President Donald Trump's executive order banning travelers from Syria, among other places. It went into effect while the six were in the air en route to Philadelphia on Jan. 28.\n\nTears fell from Ghassan Assali's face as he placed his hands on the shoulders of his brother Basam Abou Asali, 61. Their mother, Sara Obaid, who lives in Allentown, held close a third son, Hassan Abou Asali, 50. There were embraces and smiles, too, for Basam's wife Jozfin Alshahaf, 59, and Hassan's wife Jurjeet, 45, and their children Mathyo, 17, and Sara, 19. Unlike Ghassan, the family spells its last name with one S.\n\nA Syrian family turned back under President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban returned to the United States to resettle in Allentown. Relatives met them at JFK Airport on Monday morning, along with Congressman Charlie Dent. (Harry Fisher/The Morning Call) (Harry Fisher/The Morning Call)\n\nFor nine days, the house that Ghassan and Sarmad Assali bought for them on Second Street in Allentown remained empty. The days were marked by uncertainty, anger and disbelief for a Christian family that had worked 13 years to legally obtain visas and permanent residency in the U.S.\n\nThe hardest part for the Abou Asalis was returning to what was supposed to be their former home in Damascus, said Mathyo.\n\n\"All of us were very scared, we didn't know what happened,\" he said. \"We played by the rules, we didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\nU.S. Rep Charlie Dent, R-15th District, and a team of immigration lawyers helped secure reinstatement of the family's revoked visas, accelerated by U.S. District Judge James Robart's decision Friday to temporarily block Trump's executive order. His ruling was upheld Sunday by the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. On Monday, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro filed a brief joining the lawsuit filed by his counterpart in Washington state.\n\nThe family was ready to leave Damascus on short notice Saturday night and caught a flight from Beirut, Lebanon, to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nAllentown residents Ghassan and Sarmad Assali were reunited with their relatives from Damascus, Syria on Monday in New York.

That made their arrival here a little less hectic. We didn't want to have any mid-air issues again like we did nine days ago.\"\n\nThey were in the air by the time Lady Gaga sang a few lines from \"This Land Is Your Land\" during the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nSarmad Assali's face lit up when Dent walked into her garage before dawn Monday morning, ready to follow them up to New York.\n\nGhassan Assali stepped forward and embraced the congressman.\n\n\"It's all going to work out,\" Dent said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ghassan Assali said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nGhassan Assali was on his way to pick up this family in Philadelphia on Jan. 28 when he got a call from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who told him not to bother coming because his relatives had been sent back to Qatar.\n\n\"After being in such an ordeal last week, and all the fighting we did, I'm calmer today,\" Sarmad Assali said Monday. \"I'm not as angry, and I'm very excited to see them. \u2026 I just can't express my gratitude enough.\"\n\nSara Abou Asali said she was nervous that they'd meet the same reception as Jan. 28, until she finally saw the faces of her Allentown relatives.\n\nMathyo said they had come to Allentown to \"seek a better future, to find better opportunities.\" Mathyo, who is a senior, plans to finish high school. Both he and his sister hope to go to college here like their cousins Joseph and Sarah Assali have. The older Abou Asalis want to get jobs.\n\nThat doesn't mean they will forget Syria.\n\n\"Of course, it's part of us,\" Sarmad Assali said. \"We're hoping the war will end so we can visit and see all our relatives still there. We love our country.\"\n\nThe Abou Asalis were in Allentown by Monday afternoon, where members were greeted by Gov. Tom Wolf, who had been waiting in Ghassan Assali's driveway clutching a bouquet of flowers.\n\nWolf is paying out of his own pocket for the family's airfare, and the money from a GoFundMe account that was started to help pay for the family's travel will be used to get them started on their lives in the U.S.\n\nSmiling family members thanked the governor as they hopped off a bus that brought them to the Lehigh Valley from the airport. \"Thank you for wanting to come here,\" Wolf replied.\n\nDuring a quick news conference, Wolf said that he, like many Americans, came from a family of immigrants. Since the order went into effect, the governor had condemned the Trump administration for turning people away who have followed all of the legal steps necessary.\n\nShapiro, a Democrat, announces he and 14 other attorneys general have signed on to Washington state's lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's travel ban against seven Muslim-majority countries.

These folks are welcome here in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nWolf, a Democrat, thanked Dent for his work with the Departments of Homeland Security and State to get the Abou Asalis' visas reinstated, saying that the cooperation on the family's behalf showed bipartisanship.\n\n\"This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue,\" Wolf said. \"This is an American issue, and I'm really proud to stand with Congressman Dent in this process.\"\n\nBoth Dent and Wolf emphasized Monday that the Abou Asali family followed immigration law.\n\n\"The bottom line is this family did it the right way,\" Dent said earlier. \"That's what we always try to insist upon. We don't want people coming into the country illegally.\n\n\"We are celebrating the rule of law today, and we're celebrating fairness and justice. Because they were treated terribly last weekend when they were denied admission into the country.\"\n\nawagaman@mcall.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Andrew Wagaman, Emily Opilo", "type": "article"}
