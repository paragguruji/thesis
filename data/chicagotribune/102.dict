Gorsuch went before the Senate in March as President Trump\u2019s first nominee to the Supreme Court, he sought to assure senators he would be independent and above the political fray.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a Republican judge or Democratic judge,\u201d he said more than once. \u201cWe just have judges.\u201d\n\nBut in just his first few weeks on the high court, Justice Gorsuch has shown himself to be a confident conservative activist, urging his colleagues to move the law to the right on religion, gun rights, gay rights and campaign funding.\n\nHe dissented along with Justice Clarence Thomas when the court rejected a gun-rights challenge to California\u2019s law that strictly regulates who may carry a concealed weapon. \u201cThe 2nd Amendment\u2019s core purpose,\u201d they said, shows \u201cthe right to bear arms extends to public carry.\u201d\n\nHe wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., when the court struck down part of an Arkansas law that gave opposite sex-couples, but not same-sex couples, the right to have both spouses listed on a child\u2019s birth certificate. The court said it had already decided that same-sex couples deserve fully equal rights under state law.\n\nAnd when Trump\u2019s travel ban came before the court this week, Gorsuch dissented from the majority\u2019s middle-ground approach, which allowed the ban to take effect except for foreign travelers who had a relationship with this country, such as a close relative or a student enrolled in a university.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
