Robart's temporary restraining order that blocked enforcement of the controversial immigration restrictions pending further review of the legal issues raised in a suit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota.\n\nAttorneys for those states have argued that the order discriminates against Muslims. It blocks all arrivals from seven predominantly Muslim countries, and suspends all refugee resettlements.\n\nMembers of persecuted religious minorities in the seven countries are given some preference.\n\nThe case heads next to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for a decision on whether or not the travel ban can be enforced.\n\n\"This is just a notice that they are appealing. The U.S. will now file some type of motion requesting a stay, and a brief which argues why the 9th Circuit should grant it,\" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia who has been following the litigation.\n\nMargo Schlanger, a University of Michigan law professor and former civil rights official in the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security, also emphasized that the Seattle judge's order blocking the ban remains in place.\n\n\"It's not a stay application. An appeal leaves the order in place while the appeal is processed -- unless there's a stay,\" she said.\n\nLegal experts say the case, or one of the others filed challenging the ban, is likely to end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAsked about the appeal on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla., where he was visiting his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump said the administration would prevail.\n\n\"We'll win,\" Trump said. \"For the safety of the country, we'll win.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
