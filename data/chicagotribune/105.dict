John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters, so it could be assessed by the Congressional Budget Office during the break.\n\nBut senators remained skeptical after the lengthy lunchtime huddle that appeared to run long on ideas but short on consensus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n\nMcConnell surprised senators by delaying this week\u2019s expected votes once it became clear he did not have a majority for passage \u2013 or possibly to even open the debate.\n\nAs many as 10 Republican senators now publicly oppose the bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, and leaders are scrambling to win them over with an estimated $200 billion in savings from the bill that can be applied to their particular state\u2019s needs.\n\nBut even with that fund of resources, it is not clear McConnell will be able to satisfactorily improve the legislation, which now threatens to cut 22 million Americans off health insurance. He can only afford to lose two Republican votes in the face of Democratic opposition.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult to get me to a yes... have to make us an offer we can't refuse,\u201d Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said on a telephone town hall late Tuesday, according to journalist Jon Ralston, who monitored the call.\n\nFresh polling Wednesday showed paltry support for the Republican approach to overhauling the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which has enjoyed a surge in popularity now that Republicans are closer than ever to repealing it. A USA Today poll put approval of the Senate GOP bill at 12%.\n\nRepublicans, though, are under enormous pressure from their most conservative supporters \u2013 and big dollar donors, including the powerful Koch network \u2013 to deliver on their promised to end Obamacare.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that President Trump convene all 100 senators \u2013 much the way then-President Obama did during his first days in office for a session at Blair House \u2013 to see how they might be able to work together to improve, rather than repeal, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d make my friends on the Republican side and President Trump an offer: Let\u2019s turn over a new leaf. Let\u2019s start over,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, I challenge you to invite us \u2013 all 100 of us, Republican and Democrat \u2013 to Blair House to discuss a new bipartisan way forward on healthcare in front of all the American people.\u201d\n\nNo such invitation, however, seemed forthcoming. Trump dismissed Schumer's proposal \u2013 \"he just doesn't seem like a serious person,\" the president said \u2013 and instead promised his own \"big surprise\" on healthcare.\n\n\"Healthcare is working along very well,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We could have a big surprise, with a great healthcare package.\"\n\nAsked what he meant by a big surprise, Trump simply repeated: \"A great, great surprise.\"\n\nThe Republican bill, like its counterpart passed by House Republicans, does not fully gut Obamacare, but rescinds the new taxes imposed on high-income individuals and healthcare companies to pay for expanding coverage through Medicaid and subsidies for private insurance on the ACA marketplace.\n\nSenators said the private talks Wednesday focused mainly on changes to the Obamacare marketplace that could bring down the cost of insurance premiums.\n\nOne idea from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to allow insurers to offer policies that do not meet the Obamacare benchmarks for what insurance needs to cover met with mixed reaction, senators said.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician, warned that such changes would alter the risk pool, keeping insurance costs high.\n\n\u201cYou end up with policies that, for example, don\u2019t cover maternity,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cDo you want a policy that doesn\u2019t have maternity, which would be principally appealing to young men, when obviously typically men have had a role in that pregnancy?\u201d\n\nOther senators were floating new ideas, but McConnell gave no indication whether those proposals would be included in the final revised product.\n\nMichael A.
