He ignored the first question and only briefly addressed the issue in answering the second.\n\n\"As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump was referring to a disclosure in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had conducted spying operations in Germany, including the monitoring of Merkel's cellphone.\n\nThe revelation dealt a major blow to U.S.-German relations and was politically damaging to Merkel at home. But Obama and Merkel ultimately repaired the rift, and their relationship was among the closest and most critical Obama had with any world leader.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
