(House Speaker Paul D. Ryan rushed to the White House on Friday morning for a last-minute meeting with Trump as both attempted to corral enough votes.)\n\n\n\nTrump spent much of the week trying to win support from members of the Freedom Caucus, among the most conservative lawmakers, some of whom are holdouts because they believe the bill does not go far enough.\n\n\u201cAfter seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!\u201d Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nBut even some in conservative media aren\u2019t all that thrilled about the bill.\n\n\n\nHere are some of Friday\u2019s headlines:\n\n\n\nPolls: Ryancare even more unpopular than Obamacare and Hillarycare (Breitbart)\n\n\n\nSo, it\u2019s been clear in recent weeks that the right-wing website Breitbart does not like the new healthcare proposal.\n\nThe news site has dubbed the current bill Obamacare-lite or Ryancare \u2014 an homage of sorts to Ryan, who helped craft the legislation \u2014 and argued it does not go far enough in its overhaul.\n\nMost conservatives want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, they just differ on what the replacement should look like. For example, some on the far right want to see so-called \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d such as maternity and newborn care, stripped from the bill.)\n\n\n\nThis piece highlights several of the dismal polls the legislation has received.\n\n\n\nAmong them: A recent Fox News survey that showed 54% oppose the bill, compared with 34% who support it. The article also references an analysis of polling and data by FiveThirtyEight.com, which shows the GOP legislation is more unpopular than Obamacare and President Bill Clinton\u2019s healthcare reform bill were when they were first introduced.\n\n\n\nA modest immigration proposal (Weekly Standard)\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s recent immigration orders have left many immigrants on edge.\n\nThrough social media and pop-up legal clinics, immigrant rights groups have doled out around-the-clock assistance, as families fear being separated.\n\nIn this piece, Irwin Stelzer notes that \u201cat some point, our border will be secure, resistance to deporting felons will collapse, and we will have accepted the fact that Dreamers will be allowed to stay in this country, probably on a path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nHe lays out his views of immigration reform, citing, among other things, setting an annual immigration limit and adopting \u201ca system that has the effect of enriching our citizens by filling that annual quota with immigrants who are likely to increase the well-being of the existing citizenry.\u201d\n\nJeff Sessions is Rip Van Winkle on drug policy (American Conservative)\n\nIt\u2019s clear from polls that most Republicans oppose marijuana legalization, while Democrats support it.\n\n\n\nHowever, libertarian-leaning Republicans often tend to support legalization.\n\n\n\nThis piece highlights Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 recent comments in opposition to states legalizing pot.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe attorney general regurgitates simplistic clich\u00e9s right out of the 1970s and 1980s about marijuana use. \u2018I don\u2019t think America is going to be a better place when people of all ages, and particularly young people, are smoking pot,\u2019 Sessions told reporters on February 26,\u201d the author, Ted Galen Carpenter, writes.\n\n\n\nHe adds, \u201cSuch comments confirm that critics may be right when they label him a \u2018drug war dinosaur.\u2019 He seems either oblivious or scornful about the trend in public opinion regarding marijuana.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
