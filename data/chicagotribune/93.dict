{"title": "For victims of San Bernardino terrorist attack, conflicting views about Trump policy in their name", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-me-san-bernardino-trump-20170131-story.html", "text": "Abraham Amanios\u2019 younger brother Isaac was killed in 2015 when a husband and wife stormed into the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino and opened fire.\n\nThe terrorist attack, which left 14 people dead, was cited by President Trump as one reason for his controversial travel restriction policy that temporarily bars refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nAmanios, 74, wants to prevent terrorism, but he also identifies with many of the people barred under the new policy. He came to the U.S. from Sudan in 1980, after having fled violence and political persecution in northern Ethiopia during the fight for secession by the modern-day nation of Eritrea. His brother Isaac, who had fought for Eritrean independence, sought asylum in the U.S. with his family in 2000. Isaac had worked in Sudan as an interpreter at a United States resettlement camp for refugees.\n\n\u201cThe main reason that we even came here to this country, Eritreans, is because of the unstable Middle East,\u201d Abraham Amanios said, adding that he saw the Trump policy as misguided.\n\nNone of the people involved in terrorism or other things came from these countries. None of them. \u2014 Abraham Amanios\n\n\u201cNone of the people involved in terrorism or other things came from these countries,\u201d Amanios said of those included in the ban. \u201cNone of them.\u201d\n\nThe victims of the San Bernardino terror attack represented a cross-section of America.\n\nThey were Christian, Muslim and Jewish, both immigrants and people born in the United States. One woman who was killed came to the U.S. after fleeing religious persecution in Iran. Another had fled Vietnam as a child.\n\nTheir tragedy became fuel for Trump\u2019s executive order, which has roiled airports around the nation over the last week.\n\nNow, some of the attack\u2019s victims and their families are asking themselves whether the ban is the right way to keep others from suffering, as they have, the devastation of a terrorist attack.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes San Bernardino, has strongly denounced the ban and Trump\u2019s repeated mention of the terrorist attack as a motivation for it.\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201cconsistent exploitation of San Bernardino is both incorrect and shameful,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cTo use a tragedy in my community, a tragedy we\u2019re still reeling from, as a political talking point is just despicable.\u201d\n\nHal Houser, who witnessed the attack and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, said he voted for Trump and supports the order but was critical of how it was implemented.\n\nFull coverage: San Bernardino terror attack \u00bb\n\nHe said he did not agree with green card holders being banned from the country.\n\nSince the order was announced, there have been mixed signals about whether it would apply to green card holders, or lawful permanent residents. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said he deemed \u201cthe entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\u201d\n\nHouser also said he was angered that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, where the San Bernardino attackers had ties, were not on the list of countries affected by the travel ban.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he has rushed so quickly to implement this policy when it needed so much careful consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Houser, 55, said it was unfair to call Trump\u2019s executive order a Muslim ban.\n\n\u201cOne of my Muslim coworkers got shot. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to have a Muslim ban, absolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cMy office was staffed by Muslims who love America \u2014 and Syed. This punctuates how Muslims can\u2019t be broad-brushed,\u201d he said, referring to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers.\n\nFive days after the Dec. 2, 2015, attack, Trump initially proposed a \u201ctotal and complete\u201d ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nIn recent days, his administration has repeatedly referred to San Bernardino, along with other recent terror attacks, as a motivation for the order approved last week, though the policy would not have affected its perpetrators.\n\nFarook was born in the U.S. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, immigrated to the country from Pakistan on a K-1 fiancee visa and had lived in Saudi Arabia for a time.\n\nThe executive order issued Friday suspends new refugee entries into the United States for 120 days and restricts for 90 days immigration from seven -Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also bars indefinitely the admission of Syrian refugees.\n\nBennetta Betbadal, who was killed in the San Bernardino attack, fled to America from Iran to escape religious persecution of Christians, her family has said.\n\nIn a written statement provided to The Times by family friend Mark Russell, her husband, Arlen Verdehyou, said the family is \u201cin full support of what is needed to make [and] keep America safe.\u201d\n\nVerdehyou said the president should be mindful of Christians, like his wife, looking to come to the U.S. from -Muslim-majority countries. Trump has said he intends to prioritize Christian refugees over others seeking to enter the United States.\n\n\u201cWe hope America [and] President Trump can do this without violating our core values; however, we also recognize that this is no small task,\u201d Verdehyou said.\n\nJohn Ramos, who was injured in the attack, said he\u2019s still working to mentally recover from what happened that day at the Inland Regional Center.\n\nWhen Trump proposed a Muslim ban just days after the San Bernardino shootings, he didn\u2019t hear about it.\n\n\u201cI had other things on my mind,\u201d he said. At the time, he was still recovering from his injuries \u2014 it would take weeks for shattered asphalt to come out of his hands.\n\nOn Friday, Ramos saw online that Trump had signed the immigration ban and he felt a \u201ccomplete betrayal,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump is wrong for assuming a ban will prevent violence, he said. While those seeking to enter the country should be vetted and screened, Ramos doesn\u2019t see a need for more \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe person who carried out [the Dec. 2] attack was born in the U.S. and only went overseas to get a wife,\u201d Ramos, 58, said. \u201cIt\u2019s ill-conceived.\u201d\n\nThe way he sees it, Trump has used San Bernardino as fodder for a policy rooted in religious discrimination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he cares about any terror victims. There\u2019s so much confusion I don\u2019t think they know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBasically, this is a religious test,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nMilka Amanios, the 20-year-old daughter of the late Isaac Amanios, has been following the news closely since the executive order was announced and has been angered by each mention of the attack that killed her father.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Sarah Parvini, Hailey Branson-Potts, Paloma Esquivel", "type": "article"}
