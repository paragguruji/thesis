The Las Vegas massacre brings her pain \u2014 and anger about inaction on guns", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-me-lopez-guns-vegas-10022017-story.html", "text": "Irma Garcia did not go to work Monday.\n\nShe was too broken up about the Las Vegas shooting massacre, the deadliest in U.S. history. It brought back painful memories of another horrific rampage by a man with a rifle.\n\nGarcia was a 21-year-old student at the University of Texas in 1966, when a Marine named Charles Whitman climbed a tower and began shooting.\n\nSixteen people were killed and 31 wounded.\n\nGarcia was shot through the shoulder, and the bullet exited near the middle of her back. A stranger dragged her to safety while the shots kept coming.\n\n\u201cYes, this does bring it back,\u201d she said Monday by phone from her home in Whittier, where the courtroom interpreter was watching the news with her husband at her side for support.\n\nThe death toll stood at nearly 60, with hundreds injured.\n\n\u201cI feel for those people. It was so horrible and out of the blue, and you don\u2019t expect it. I\u2019m thinking about all of them, and the ones who survived should get some help. Psychological help. I want to let people know it takes a while.\u201d\n\nSmoke rises from a sniper's gun as he fires from the tower of the University of Texas administration building in 1966. Smoke rises from a sniper's gun as he fires from the tower of the University of Texas administration building in 1966.\n\nThe last time I spoke to Garcia was in April 2013. A few months earlier, 20 elementary school children had been shot and killed \u2014 and six adults murdered \u2014 in Newtown, Conn. by a lone, well-armed gunman. It was a tragedy so incomprehensible, many thought it would lead, finally, to comprehensive gun control.\n\nBut just before I met with Garcia, an assault weapons ban and an amendment to expand background checks on gun purchases had failed in Congress.\n\n\u201cI was so disappointed,\u201d she told me at the time. \u201cI just wish senators had had more courage to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nWill it be any different this time?\n\nGarcia said she hopes so. Me, too. But I\u2019m not betting on it.\n\nThe National Rifle Assn. spent millions of dollars helping elect President Trump, who later told the gun lobby:\n\n\u201cYou have a true friend and champion in the White House.\u201d\n\nThe congressional GOP delegation, as well as some Democratic lawmakers, are among the NRA\u2019s true champions.\n\nI don\u2019t think it matters how many people get killed in Newtown, Orlando, San Bernardino or Las Vegas. The numbers and details do not make a difference.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers knew that without 2nd Amendment freedom, all of our freedoms could be in jeopardy,\u201d NRA boss Wayne LaPierre said after Newtown. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t free to protect yourself \u2014 when government puts its thumb on that freedom \u2014 then you aren\u2019t free at all.\u201d\n\nNo one is free or safe, as a matter of fact, when automatic weapons such as the one used by the Vegas shooter are easy to get ahold of. No such weapon is necessary for self-defense, and no one should be able to amass dozens of firearms, as the Vegas shooter did, without alarms going off.\n\nFor all the talk of Muslim travel bans to protect Americans on our own soil, a far bigger threat is domestic terrorism \u2014 and, by extension, the NRA. But so far in Washington, the official response to such tragedies hasn\u2019t been to make it harder for weapons to fall into the wrong hands. A package of bills is pending, one of which would make it easier to purchase silencers, and another that would expand the right of gun owners with concealed carry permits to take their weapons into states with more restrictive gun laws.\n\nA child gazes from a school bus as it passes by the funeral service for shooting victim Jessica Rekos, 6, on Dec. 18, 2012, in Newtown, Conn. A child gazes from a school bus as it passes by the funeral service for shooting victim Jessica Rekos, 6, on Dec. 18, 2012, in Newtown, Conn.\n\nA far bigger issue than mass shootings is the daily toll of gun violence, most of which doesn\u2019t make headlines.\n\n\u201cMass shootings are horrible and grab the nation by the lapels,\u201d said Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer, who has worked on gun control as a city councilman, legislator and prosecutor. So sure, he said, restricting large magazines and automatic weapons are public policy no-brainers.\n\nBut the majority of gun violence, Feuer said, is from suicide, domestic abuse and gang violence.\n\n\u201cOur focus should be not on what might have had an impact on any one case,\u201d Feuer said, \u201cbut on what will have an impact in reducing violence generally.\u201d\n\nFeuer \u2014 who is strategizing with a bipartisan group of prosecutors nationally \u2014 said one helpful reform would be to make it illegal in every state for someone subject to a temporary restraining order to purchase a gun.\n\nThe city attorney also thinks there\u2019s room for more careful restrictions on gun purchases by people with mental health issues.\n\nIn my conversation with Garcia, she told me \u2014 and then repeated for emphasis \u2014 that she was heartbroken by what her home state of Texas has done about guns at school. Last year, Texas made it legal to carry concealed weapons on college campuses, and that right has now been expanded to include community colleges.\n\nShe does not agree with the argument that, in a nation with an estimated 300 million guns and far more gun violence than any other country, having more guns on campus makes everyone safer.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to say, well, if you have a gun you can defend yourself,\u201d said Garcia, who had nightmares for years and whose upper body is still twisted from the damage caused by the bullet that tore into her. \u201cHow are you going to defend yourself if a whole bunch of people are packing guns? Can you imagine the crossfire?\u201d\n\nJust as someone came to her aid half a century ago, Garcia said, lots of brave people came to the aid of those who were cut down in Las Vegas. She sees hope in that, and prays there\u2019s a national reconciliation on curbing senseless violence.\n\nOne commentator said Monday that mass shootings are the price of freedom.\n\nIt\u2019s true that we can\u2019t protect everyone at all times in a country that values civil liberties.\n\nBut mass shootings and daily bloodshed are not the price of freedom.\n\nThey are the price of gun lust, the multimillion-dollar clout of the gun lobby, the mind-twisting glorification of violence and, most of all, the unconscionable failure of lawmakers to keep us as safe as we can possibly be.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
