Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Atty. Mike Feuer and City Controller Ron Galperin \u2014 signed a statement calling for the creation of Jews United for Justice and Democracy.\n\nThe group \u201cis deeply concerned about rising threats to religious tolerance, equal rights, a free and fair press, human dignity, and long-held norms of decency and civil society,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cWe will speak out and take action when our shared Jewish values require us to counter those threats.\u201d\n\nThe coalition gathered the signatures last weekend from more than 110 clergy members, L.A. County\u2019s entire state legislative Jewish delegation, seven current and former members of Congress, and 60 current and former elected and appointed officials.\n\nWe know what the costs are of remaining silent. \u2014 Zev Yaroslavsky, organizing committee member for Jews United for Justice and Democracy\n\nThe group\u2019s focus is on three guiding principles: America is a nation of laws, of immigrants and \u201caspires to equality, respect and justice for all people.\u201d\n\nZev Yaroslavsky, a former L.A. County supervisor and one of the six members of the group\u2019s organizing committee, said he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for the coalition. He said the group will stand by refugees fleeing oppression as well as immigrants in the United States who \u201ctonight as they go to sleep fear a knock on the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something the Jewish community wants to speak out on,\u201d Yaroslavsky said. \u201cIt speaks to a thirst in our community to stand up and not be silent. We know what the costs are of remaining silent.\u201d\n\nWhile the effort to form the coalition was undertaken before the recent desecration of Jewish cemeteries and bomb threats to Jewish centers in L.A. and other cities, those issues are also concerning, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the atmosphere that is plaguing our nation right now,\u201d Yaroslavsky said.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
