He\u2019s been trying to woo a handful of Democrats in hopes of reaching the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster. Part of his approach has been to assure them that if he is confirmed, he would be independent of the man who picked him.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gorsuch met with one of the uncommitted Democrats, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Gorsuch told Blumenthal that he was \"disheartened\" by disparaging statements Trump had made about judges. Trump has aimed his attacks at judges who have been considering legal challenges to his temporary bans on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. On Thursday, a three-judge federal appeals court panel ruled unanimously against Trump and refused to reinstate the ban.\n\nBlumenthal quickly made the remark public, noting later that Gorsuch had said he was free to do so. A spokesman for Gorsuch confirmed the remark to reporters.\n\nThursday morning, the former senator who is guiding Gorsuch through the nomination process, confirmed the words again.\n\n\u201cHe said that he finds any criticism of a judge\u2019s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing,\u201d former Sen. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement. Gorsuch was not commenting on any specific case and emphasized that he was troubled by any attack on the judiciary, she said.\n\nSenate aides and others familiar with the confirmation process interpreted the comments as a careful effort to distance the nominee just far enough from Trump\u2019s controversial remarks to win over the Democratic votes he wants.\n\nThe White House team shepherding Gorsuch\u2019s nomination appeared to be trying to give Democrats a \u201cjustification for voting for him,\u201d said James Manley, who served as a top aide to former Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada when he was the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader.\n\nBut if that was the plan, Trump, notoriously sensitive to criticism, complicated it.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday morning, he took a shot at Blumenthal, saying the senator had misrepresented Gorsuch's comments. For good measure, the president also took aim at Blumenthal's credibility, bringing up a seven-year-old controversy over his military service.\n\n\u201cRichard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nDuring Blumenthal's campaign for Senate in 2010, he was criticized for claiming in speeches that he had served in Vietnam. Blumenthal had been in the Marine Corps Reserve and was not posted overseas. He later said he had misspoken about his record a few times out of the hundreds of speeches he has given in his political career.\n\nA few hours later, in a meeting at the White House with several senators, Trump repeated that criticism.\n\n\u201cHis comments were misrepresented. And what you should do is ask Sen. Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist after years of him saying it did,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\n\u201cHe misrepresented that just like he misrepresented Judge Gorsuch,\u201d Trump added, as a couple of Blumenthal\u2019s Democratic colleagues sat nearby.\n\nOne of them, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, later said he remained uncommitted. \u201cI will continue to review Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record, qualifications and his future testimony to determine if I will support him,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe sequence of events generated multiple theories about what was taking place behind the scenes: Had Gorsuch\u2019s comments caught the White House by surprise or, as many Democrats speculated, had they been part of the administration plan all along?\n\nManley said he leaned toward the simple explanation \u2014 that even if some administration officials knew that Gorsuch would try to distance himself from Trump, the president \u201cdid what comes naturally, lashing out\u201d at criticism.\n\n\u201cI think the guy can\u2019t help himself,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t say how Blumenthal had \u201cmisrepresented\u201d Gorsuch\u2019s comments. But in the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Gorsuch had been speaking only about \u201chis general philosophy about the judiciary,\u201d not about any specific criticisms Trump had made about judges.\n\n\"There is a big difference between commenting on the specific comments that had been made in a tweet and his general philosophy about the judiciary and his respect for his fellow judges,\" Spicer said.\n\n\u201cAs a whole, he doesn\u2019t like attacks, in general, on the judiciary.\u201d\n\nThat interpretation might have assuaged the president\u2019s feelings, but it undermined whatever effort Gorsuch might have been making to demonstrate independence. It gave Democratic leaders an opening to step up demands that he more explicitly denounce Trump\u2019s comments.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "David Lauter, Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
