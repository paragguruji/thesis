He said Flynn was asked to resign only because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about those discussions.\n\nHis denial was perhaps the most notable development in a a lengthy news conference in which he berated the press and complained that he had \"inherited a mess.\"\n\nPresident Trump said Thursday that \u201cnobody that I know of\u201d from his campaign contacted Russian agents or government officials before his election.\n\n\u201cI fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence \u2014 very simple,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt certainly would have been OK with me\" if Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when President Obama was still in office.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFlynn's discussion of sanctions while another administration was still setting U.S. policy was seen as inappropriate, and possibly illegal.\n\nTrump also promised to issue a new version of his travel ban next week, and he vowed it would withstand court scrutiny.\n\nHe complained that his many accomplishments were not being recognized while insisting that his much-criticized early weeks in office were going smoothly. He even said his travel ban worked without a hitch, despite numerous problems at airports around the country.\n\nTrump hedged when several reporters asked him to definitively state whether anyone in his campaign had contacted Russians before the election, saying repeatedly that he himself had no involvement with the Russian government. He also said that political controversy would make it hard to cut a wide-ranging deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that he was nonetheless committed to trying.\n\nThe news conference was a return to Trump's more spontaneous public side that characterized his campaign. He sparred with the press, bragged about the size of his election victory, boasted of his television ratings and continued to take shots at Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI won with news conferences,\u201d he said, as if explaining why he chose to hold the impromptu news conference.\n\nTrump, while relentlessly bemoaning what he said was unfair coverage, nonetheless insisted that he was having a good time.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, they will say, 'Donald Trump rants and raves about the press,'\" he said. \"I'm not ranting and raving.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
