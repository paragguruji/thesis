It\u2019s narrower, drops Iraq from the list of countries affected and does not apply to people who already have valid visas or U.S. green cards. The 90-day ban affects would-be visitors from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.\n\nLast year, international travel into Florida accounted for about 13 percent of the nearly 113 million tourists to come to the state, according to Visit Florida, the state\u2019s tourism agency.\n\nThe United Kingdom branch of travel website Kayak reported that searches for flights to parts of Florida, including Orlando, are down significantly. Searches for flights to Tampa and Orlando are down 58 percent, with South Florida destinations such as Fort Lauderdale and Miami also feeling the pinch with 57 and 52 percent drops, respectively.\n\nThe searches are down year-over-year during the period of July 1 to Feb. 16, compared with a year earlier.\n\nCentral Florida could face a slump in tourists as a result of Trump\u2019s policies, Bowers said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to just see how that kind of works its way out,\u201d he told local hotel industry leaders last week. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern and it would be something I would keep an eye on like a hawk, to be honest.\u201d\n\nWhile people wait to hear about Trump\u2019s next executive order, Jonathan Grella, executive vice president of public affairs at tourism-business organization U.S. Travel, said he\u2019s hoping any policies are unveiled in better fashion. He said telling the world which nationalities couldn\u2019t come to the U.S., while still trying to set out the welcome mat for others, was unsettling for international travelers planning trips.\n\n\u201cThere is unavoidable reputational fallout that was triggered last time around with the sloppy roll out,\u201d Grella said.\n\nTrump\u2019s original executive order banned inbound travel to the U.S. by citizens from Syria, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days from its issuance in January. It also prohibited the admittance of all refugees for 120 days. The ban led to protests around the country, including demonstrations at airports where passengers were being detained or returned home, before the order was suspended in federal court.\n\nSince then, U.S. Travel has been meeting with destination-marketing organizations across the country, including Visit Orlando and other tourism heavyweights such as NYC & Company.\n\nAgencies are taking their own approach to handle any marketing ground lost from the Trump administration, Grella said. New York tourism leaders are doubling down, he said, and increasing their marketing expenditures.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll probably see more and more of that in other places,\u201d he said.\n\nVisit Orlando leaders have kept their cool, he said, without offering much detail.\n\n\u201cWhile we are keeping a close watch on the rest of the year through our research efforts, at this point it would be premature to determine if there is a potential decline in overall international visitation to our region,\u201d said George Aguel, Visit Orlando\u2019s president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\nHe said Visit Orlando would also need to determine if any decline \u201ccan be specifically attributed to the administration\u2019s executive orders\u201d rather than headwinds from a strengthening dollar or the timing of Easter.\n\nGrella said U.S. Travel will also do what it can to decipher whether any downward trends would be directly linked to a travel ban.\n\nExperience Kissimmee leaders delayed scheduled marketing campaigns, which had been set to begin in February, as tensions rise between U.S. leaders and the Mexican government over the proposed border wall.\n\n\u201cFor Mexico, it would have been a total waste of money to launch the campaign,\u201d said DT Minich, Kissimmee\u2019s president and chief executive officer.\n\nAt this rate, he said he\u2019s hoping to start it sometime in April. He said postponing it was easy, since it didn\u2019t involve a lot of print ads.\n\nThe messaging Kissimmee planned to deliver revolved around the agency\u2019s new slogan, \u201cWe make vacations.\u201d That won\u2019t change, said Minich.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get political,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get in the fray of that.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press contributed.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": "Caitlin Dineen", "type": "article"}
