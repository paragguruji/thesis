He found a county government job and settled in Long Beach with his wife and children.\n\nThis weekend, Rawi\u2019s 69-year-old father, a retired civil engineer who lives in Baghdad, was scheduled to arrive for a long-awaited visit. But those plans were abruptly upended Friday when President Trump on Friday suspended admissions from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq \u2014 throwing countless Muslim families into turmoil, and setting off a sleepless night for Rawi.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know how this is possible,\u201d said Rawi, who worked in The Times\u2019 Baghdad bureau during some of the most violent years of the Iraq war. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Is it going to be internment camps like World War II where they put all the Japanese in one camp? They\u2019ll do the same for us? This is not what this country is all about.\u201d\n\nThe executive order signed Friday suspends all refugee entries for 120 days, blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars for 90 days the entry of citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.\n\nA federal judge in New York late Saturday stayed parts of the order as it applies to those currently waiting at U.S. airports for admission. For others, there remained nothing but uncertainty.\n\nAround the world, students and workers caught outside the U.S. were suddenly uncertain when they would be allowed to return. Refugees expecting safe resettlement in the U.S. were detained at airports. And families whose loved ones were stranded abroad were left in a state of crippling anxiety.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand the logic,\u201d said Moustafa Kanjo, a Syrian refugee who arrived in Pomona in September 2015. \u201cWhy would we be a security risk here? Our ultimate goal is to run away from violence.\u201d\n\nFor Rawi, the chaos began less than two hours after Trump signed the order on Friday. About 6 p.m., he received a jarring message on WhatsApp.\n\nIt was from his father.\n\nHe\u2019d been set to board a plane in Doha, Qatar, when an airline employee took his passport somewhere and returned with a U.S. Embassy representative.\n\nHe could not get on the plane, the man said. His visa \u2014 which allowed for multiple visits to the U.S. over the course of a year \u2014 was no longer valid: It was canceled by the president, he said.\n\nRawi\u2019s father was ushered to a room where he waited for several hours with about 30 other people.\n\nEventually, he was sent back to Baghdad. He returned home empty-handed; when he arrived, he found out his luggage was lost.\n\nThe younger Rawi had to find a way to tell his children that their grandfather wouldn\u2019t be coming after all. The youngest, 3-year-old Layla, had been so excited over his impending visit that she slept in the dress she had chosen to greet him. Her older brother had been too excited to sleep at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Rawi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the inconvenience, it\u2019s not only about us being disappointed\u2026but it\u2019s about how this was all done.\u201d\n\nIt's frustrating, most of all. Makes me sad for my in-laws and family, but mostly I\u2019m really scared. \u2014 Bahareh Aslani, 34, Iranian American\n\nAli Abdi, a 30-year-old student from Iran, has been studying for his PhD in anthropology at Yale University, and had left the U.S. last week for the United Arab Emirates on his way to a research trip in Afghanistan.\n\nNow Abdi, who has been living in the U.S. for the last four years, is unsure what to do. He cannot return to Iran, where he faces potential imprisonment for his political activism. His visa for the UAE won\u2019t allow him to stay there for long, nor does he have permission for an extended stay in Afghanistan.\n\nMost seriously, under Trump\u2019s new order, he can no longer return to the U.S. to finish his studies.\n\nAbdi is trying to be philosophical. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything... From an anthropological perspective I can write a lot,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat has happened is very illuminating. The main problem is the lives of thousands of others who are torn apart by what happened.\u201d\n\nMany were scanning their social media feeds or watching television, trying to make sense of the new policy and understand what happens next.\n\nBahareh Aslani, a 34-year-old Iranian American, has been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony in Baltimore in April to celebrate her marriage to her husband, Mostapha Roudsari, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nRoudsari\u2019s parents, who live in Iran, went to Dubai in December and applied for a visa to enter the U.S., waiting 2 \u00bd months for an appointment at the U.S. embassy. The couple was told that the mother\u2019s visa had been approved and that the father\u2019s visa had been approved, pending additional documents.\n\nNow, both are barred from entry and will not be able to attend the wedding and are devastated, Aslani said.\n\n\u201cIt's frustrating, most of all,\u201d Aslani said. \u201cMakes me sad for my in-laws and family, but mostly I\u2019m really scared, because is this the beginning? Are they going to come after me?\u201d\n\nEven those refugees safely settled in the U.S. were fearful that they would be unable to see family members in the future. News of Trump\u2019s order distressed Kanjo, who was expecting an uncle and cousins to arrive in a few months.\n\nKanjo and his family came to California from the Syrian city of Homs, sponsored by First Presbyterian Church of Pomona.\n\nMembers of the church, assisted by others in the community, met the family at the airport and provided them with an apartment and help to navigate the school and social services systems.\n\n\u201cThe most significant thing we did was be friends with them,\u201d Pastor Adam Donner said.\n\nWith the help of Google translate, the Kanjos and church members have spent hours in conversation.\n\n\u201cThey would all gladly go home to Syria if they had a home to go to,\u201d Donner said. \u201cThey are here because they are trying to find a safe place for their family to grow up.\u201d\n\nNobar Elmi Golhar, 36, lives in Brooklyn and has never been to Iran, but worries about whether her family in Iran will be able to continue to visit. Her aunt and uncle, both green card holders who have children in the United States, were in the U.S. when the executive order was signed, and now both are uncertain whether it\u2019s wise to go back home to Iran \u2014 they may not be allowed to return.\n\n\u201cThey are here and want to return to Iran, but now they are very worried if they can come back,\u201d Golhar said. \u201cThey are trying to better understand what is going on and watch the news and ask what they should expect.\u201d\n\nWhat they are feeling, she said, is panic.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Alene Tchekmedyian, Melissa Etehad, Harriet Ryan", "type": "article"}
