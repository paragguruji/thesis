Some aid workers, journalists and academics also travel there.\n\nActions that are not criminal, or not major crimes, elsewhere can lead to harsh punishment under North Korea's totalitarian system. More than a dozen Americans have been arrested and detained since 2009, and three are still held there.\n\nNauert said Tillerson decided to ban U.S. travel to North Korea \"due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention\" there.\n\n\"The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,\" she added.\n\nThe restriction will be published next week in the Federal Register and take effect 30 days later. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis for some humanitarian travel, Nauert said.\n\nThe action comes as President Trump grapples to find a strategy to pressure North Korea to rein in its robust nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests in a period of rising tensions.\n\nIn April, Trump personally sought the help of Chinese President Xi Jinping to influence North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but that strategy has largely failed to produce results.\n\nSince then, the administration has added new sanctions on people or companies, including some in China, that do business in or with North Korea.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea tested a missile that flew a trajectory that U.S. experts said indicated an ability for the first time to cross the Pacific and potentially threaten the United States.\n\nU.S. officials say the country has yet to build a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a missile and survive, but that is probably a matter of time.\n\nThe State Department announcement focused, however, on the risk of arrests and imprisonment.\n\nA University of Virginia student, Otto F. Warmbier, was arrested at the end of his trip to Pyongyang with a tour group in January 2016 for attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel.\n\nTwo months later, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor. In June, he was released on medical grounds and flown to Cincinnati in a coma. He died six days later.\n\nWarmbier's family says they have not received a satisfactory explanation of what happened.\n\nNorth Korea said Warmbier contracted botulism shortly after he was imprisoned, was given a sleeping pill and never woke up. U.S. doctors did not find that version plausible.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "authors": "Tracy Wilkinson", "type": "article"}
