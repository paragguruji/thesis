Go home!\"\n\nA teaser for the spot began airing on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Budweiser, the ad, \"Born the Hard Way,\" has nothing to do with the current political climate, even though Trump signed an executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majorities countries.\n\nMarcel Marcondes, Anheuser-Busch vice president of marketing, said the commercial and its concept were in the works long before the travel ban. He told the Washington Post:\n\n\"Our focus this week is on our Super Bowl ads and our brands. We created the Budweiser commercial to highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream. This is a story about our heritage and the uncompromising commitment that goes into brewing our beer. It's an idea we've been developing along with our creative agency for nearly a year.\"\n\nBut some people aren't buying it.\n\nThe hashtag #BoycottBudwiser \u2014 and to a lesser extent the correctly spelled #BoycottBudweiser \u2014 is blowing up on Twitter.\n\nBut Boycott Bud movement also is drawing anti-Trump comments as well:\n\nThe Oregonian | Tribune News Service", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
