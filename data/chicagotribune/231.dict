They are two of the last refugees to trickle into Chicago following last week's presidential order suspending the national refugee program.\n\n\"We are happy,\" Geogette, 32, said through an interpreter. \"We want to look for a job and school.\"\n\nEdwina, 26, simply touched her palm to her chest several times.\n\nDespite the Trump administration's 120-day ban on new refugees, entry was permitted this week for 872 who were already in transit because denying them would cause \"undue hardship,\" according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nGeogette and Edwina, who came Wednesday, were among those final arrivals. As young girls, they'd fled violence and civil war in their native Congo and spent the past 18 years in a refugee camp in Zambia. They were scheduled to come Tuesday to Chicago but were delayed in Dubai.\n\n\"We've been holding our breath every step of the way,\" said Jessica Schaffer, director of Hebrew Immigration Aid Society Chicago.\n\nTwo Congolese refugees arrive at O'Hare International Airport on Feb. 1, 2017, among the last refugees to be resettled here in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's executive order.

With the U.S. refugee program stalled, any kind of family reunion for them is in limbo.\n\nLast week's executive order also banned entry from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and barred Syrians from travel to the United States indefinitely. The Trump administration and others who support the measure consider these restrictions crucial to properly vet migrants and protect the nation from terrorism. Many opponents have denounced the order for damaging the nation's reputation abroad as well as unfairly separating family members.\n\nRefugees already undergo lengthy background checks and security screenings that take at least 18 months prior to approval, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\"Certainly these two women, and all of the folks we work with, have been waiting years, sometimes decades, to arrive,\" Schaffer said. \"And to know that process has now been stalled by this executive order, it's just heartbreaking.\"\n\nCaring for the stranger\n\nWearing jackets and sharing one small piece of luggage, the sisters were welcomed to their new home with flowers and balloons \u2014 and thick winter coats \u2014 by about two dozen volunteers from a north suburban synagogue and church that jointly sponsored them.\n\nThe week has been an emotional roller coaster for those sponsors, who raced to furnish and decorate a local apartment when they learned the sisters narrowly made it. They plan to pay their rent and help the sisters acclimate to the culture and customs of their new homeland \u2014 everything from navigating bus routes to writing a resume.\n\n\"It's very much at the core of our tradition to make sure that we are taking care of the stranger, making sure that we are looking out for the vulnerable of society,\" said Rabbi Paul Cohen of Temple Jeremiah in Northfield. \"Because we know what that's like from very early on, from Egyptian slavery all the way through history. We know what it's like to be oppressed, persecuted and to be exiled.\"\n\nVic Doucette, a volunteer from St. Francis Xavier Church in Wilmette, also said his Catholic faith prompted him to help folks he's never met from across the globe. He said he's skeptical of the Trump administration's plan to give immigration priority to religious minorities \u2014 typically Christians \u2014 in those restricted Middle Eastern nations.\n\n\"We wonder about how that's going to affect other people who aren't Christian,\" he said. \"I would help anybody.\"\n\nA teddy bear\n\nAn empty two-bedroom apartment in Skokie has been fully furnished for three weeks, awaiting a Syrian family that was scheduled to arrive Feb. 6.\n\nA little teddy bear sits atop one of the beds, intended for a 10-year-old boy.\n\n\"It was cleaned and readied with love and anticipation,\" said Pastor Kevin McLemore of Epiphany United Church of Christ in the North Center neighborhood, which had volunteered to host the refugee family. He said many volunteers were excited to help guide the family in \"all of the frustrations and all of the joys that come with anyone navigating a new place.\"\n\nThe mother, father and two sons have been awaiting resettlement since 2013. Their arrival, however, has been stalled indefinitely with the executive order.\n\nThursday afternoon, two more Congolese refugees arrived at the O'Hare international terminal. Mwenge, 65, and her son Mukamba had been living in a refugee camp in Uganda for about five years. They had already been traveling when the new immigration restrictions took hold but were able to arrive just in time, according to officials with their resettlement agency, RefugeeOne.\n\nMwenge will be reunited with her daughter \u2014 who had just been released from the hospital after giving birth \u2014 and seven grandchildren. They were all resettled as refugees in the United States in 2015 and live in Chicago.\n\nMwenge and Mukamba initially will live in that Skokie apartment once intended for the Syrian refugee family.\n\nChris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Congolese refugee Mwege, 65, is greeted by her sister Shakalili Kininga, right, upon Mwege's arrival at at O'Hare International Airport's Terminal 5 on Wednesday, February 1, 2017.
