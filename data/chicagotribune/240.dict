They included Hessan Noorian, a Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran.\n\nProtesters rallied at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017, after travelers were held, including those with green cards and visas, following President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration.

Their son, Ryan, was born six months ago in suburban Chicago. They had been visiting Tehran to introduce their child to their family.\n\n\n\nWhen they landed at O\u2019Hare around noon Saturday, immigration officers told them Noorian could not enter the country without answering some questions, Amirisefat said. They waved her and the baby through, but, despite her husband\u2019s urging her to go home, she refused to leave without him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to him, if they would send him back. I wasn\u2019t going to leave him to go through that alone.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe couple, who said they work at Oakton Community College, then texted Amirisefat\u2019s brother and submitted to five hours of on-and-off questioning. The treatment during his time in custody was neither abusive nor exemplary, she said. She was allowed to nurse her son in a private room after making several requests, and her husband was given juice when he felt his blood sugar levels drop.\n\nThe couple \u2014 jet-lagged from their 20-hour trip home from Iran \u2014 looked tired and confused as they exited customs around 5:30 p.m. Noorian carried the names of about a dozen people he said were still being held and phone numbers for their relatives.\n\n\n\nNoorian\u2019s brother-in-law, Mohammad Amirisefat, said before Noorian\u2019s release: \u201cThis is insulting. This is insane, this is truly insane.\u201d After the release, Noorian\u2019s wife said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed late Friday afternoon, suspends entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, bars Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocks entry for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order also bars green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States.\n\nAbdulsalam Mused, 66, at his Oak Lawn home on Jan. 29, 2017, was detained at O'Hare International Airport over the weekend after returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia.

It takes a lot of people to allow something like this to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbout 150 lawyers summoned by the International Refugee Assistance Project gathered near McDonald\u2019s at O\u2019Hare to represent those being held. The lawyers paced through the arrivals terminal, making their presence known to people waiting for travelers.\n\n\n\nHeidi Walczak, 40, of Arlington Heights, bought coffee for the lawyers at O\u2019Hare. Another person bought pizzas. Cheers erupted. \u201cWe just wanted to help out and come and show our support,\u201d Walczak said. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t do any of the legal stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the lawyers group said 17 people were taken into custody, and shortly after 10 p.m. they confirmed that all had been let go. None of them held refugee status, said Hannah Garst, a Chicago lawyer.\n\nAnother Chicago-area resident temporarily caught in the federal net was Iranian Kasra Noohi, 70, of Chicago\u2019s South Loop neighborhood.\n\n\n\nHis sons, Ayden, 37, and Bardia, 32, waited for hours at O\u2019Hare for their father, who they said had a U.S. green card. According to the sons, Noohi was on his plane, traveling from the United Arab Emirates, when Trump signed his order.\n\n\n\n\u201cPart of me is angry, part of me is scared,\u201d Bardia Noohi said. \u201cI feel like this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyden Noohi said this incident made him think of when people of Japanese descent were put into internment camps during World War II. \u201cIs history going to repeat itself?\u201d he said. \u201cAre we going to go down this path of racism?\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long wait for their father to emerge, they found out that he had been freed earlier, had not seen them in the confusing, protester-filled crowd, and had simply taken a cab home to the South Loop.\n\nMohammad Amirisefat of Chicago waits for news about relatives at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017.

He said authorities repeatedly asked him whether he was carrying weapons and whether he had visited his native Yemen while on his trip to Saudi Arabia for his son\u2019s wedding.\n\n\n\nHe said he was treated nicely, but the experience still left him shaken.\n\n\n\n\u201cI received political asylum in the United States because I stood up to terrorists in Yemen,\u201d said Mused, who has lived in the U.S. for 18 years. \u201cThis is the first time in my life that I was made to feel like a terrorist.\u201d\n\n\n\nWearing a pinstripe suit and tie, Mused encouraged the president to rescind his order. \u201cThis is not what America is about,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is about freedom of expression and freedom of religion. It\u2019s a country of immigrants. It\u2019s not this.\u201d\n\nHis son Nasser Mused, 36, also of Oak Lawn, said his father was looking forward to seeking citizenship this May.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe did everything right,\u201d Nasser Mused said. \u201cHe feels safe here because you have freedom of speech and freedom to be who you want to be. This is our country. He would do anything to serve this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nNour Ulayyet, 40, of Valparaiso, Ind., told The Associated Press that her sister, a Syrian living in Saudi Arabia, was sent back after arriving at O\u2019Hare from Riyadh and told she couldn\u2019t enter the U.S. to help care for their sick mother. Ulayyet said some officials at the airport were apologizing to her sister, who had a valid visa.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mom was already having pain enough to go through this on top of the pain that she\u2019s having,\u201d Ulayyet said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Grace Wong, Stacy St. Clair", "type": "article"}
