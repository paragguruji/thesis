{"title": "Another terror attack, another thoughtless Trump tweetstorm", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-ol-trump-london-20170604-story.html", "text": "After Saturday night\u2019s terrorist attack in London, President Trump tweeted: \u201cWhatever the United States can do to help in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that admirable expression of solidarity wasn\u2019t his first or last Twitter comment on the attack.\n\nHis first Twitter response was to recycle a Drudge Report tweet reading: \u201cFears of new terror attack after van 'mows down 20 people' on London Bridge.\u201d\n\nA little more than an hour later, he tweeted again, using the attack as leverage to try to persuade the Supreme Court to reverse a federal appeals court\u2019s ruling that his revised executive order on immigration was unconstitutional:\n\n\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d (Never mind that the travel ban wouldn\u2019t apply to the UK or that it wasn\u2019t clear at that point that the perpetrators weren\u2019t British subjects.)\n\nThen came the tweet expressing solidarity and condolences.\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t finished. On Sunday morning he tweeted: \u201cWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, he shamed the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan: \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis was a tasteless twisting of what Khan said. Here\u2019s the full quotation: \"Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. There's no reason to be alarmed.\"\n\nIn other words, the mere presence of the police in a neighborhood wouldn\u2019t mean that there was a threat in that area; not that hard to understand.\n\nFinally, Trump tweeted: \u201cDo you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!\u201d\n\nCritics rushed to point out that had guns been as plentiful in the UK as they are in the U.S. there probably would have been more deaths in London on Saturday night.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the State Department issued a more traditionally diplomatic and restrained statement of solidarity with the British on its Twitter account. But the president is the leader of the country and, for better or worse, his tweets have achieved the status of official pronouncements.\n\nLate last month, as the investigation of possible ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign dominated the headlines, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was considering asking lawyers to screen his tweets. Maybe someone from the State Department should also be involved. Trump\u2019s tweets about Russia aren\u2019t the only ones that need to be subjected to extreme vetting.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
