She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\u201d\n\nThis attack follows Trump tweets aimed at Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but there are a few especially notable aspects to it. First, it was entirely personal: The critiques of Boeing and Lockheed were at least ostensibly related to public policy \u2014 he was questioning the cost of Defense Department procurements from those companies. But there\u2019s no public policy aspect to whether Nordstrom continues to carry Ivanka\u2019s merchandise, only the question of how much lucre flows into the Trump family\u2019s pocket.\n\nSecond, this tweet was particularly incoherent. What could Ivanka\u2019s being \u201ca great person\u201d have to do with Nordstrom\u2019s business decisions, even assuming for the sake of argument that it\u2019s true?\n\nThird, and perhaps most important from a business standpoint, the market impact of Trump\u2019s tweet was especially evanescent. The big retailer\u2019s stock took a hit around the time of the tweet, falling about 0.65% to $42.47 as trading volume soared from about 6,700 shares in the minute or so before the tweet dropped to roughly a half-million shares during the four minutes that followed. But the action was over soon thereafter; by 2:01 p.m. New York time, Nordstrom was back above its pre-Trump peak. The shares closed at $44.53, a gain of more than 4% on a day when the rest of the market was essentially flat.\n\nYcharts With action like Nordstrom's stock saw on Wednesday, CEOs may hope their companies can attract a Trump tweet attack With action like Nordstrom's stock saw on Wednesday, CEOs may hope their companies can attract a Trump tweet attack (Ycharts)\n\nNordstrom announced Feb. 2 that it was dropping Ivanka-branded shoes and handbags from its merchandise offerings starting with the spring season, which is starting now. The company attributed the decision to the brand\u2019s poor \u201cperformance,\u201d rather than to politics.\n\nWhen Trump first started hectoring corporations by name via Twitter, we observed that his market-moving tweets were a scandal waiting to happen. There was the chance that a member of his inner circle clued in to his tweeting plans might try to trade ahead of them. Moreover, these off-the-cuff tweets signaled that Trump was insensitive to the fact that every word of a president \u201cis parsed to the nth degree, every thought magnified to global significance, no matter how casual or careless.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, while it\u2019s not uncommon for presidents to try to jawbone industries or even individual companies, it\u2019s very unusual for a president to settle personal scores with a corporation using his bully pulpit.\n\nBut the Nordstrom tweet appears to have eradicated the line between the public interest and Trump\u2019s interest. That\u2019s why it was termed \u201coutrageous\u201d in a tweet by Norm Eisen, a former chief ethics officer for the Obama White House and the co-founder of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Trump not only issued the tweet from his personal account, but retweeted it on his official @POTUS account.\n\nTrump spokesman Sean Spicer illustrated the depth of the Administration\u2019s insensitivity to conflicts of interest in his defense of the tweet. Trump is \u201cleading this country,\u201d he said at a press briefing Wednesday. \u201cFor people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.\"\n\nCriticism also came from the other side of the political divide, with Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary for George W. Bush, tweeting, \u201cThis is something a father would say. It\u2019s not the type of thing a President of the United States should say.\u201d\n\nAnd as Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observed, there\u2019s an aspect of commercial favoritism to the Nordstrom\u2019s tweet that makes it especially inappropriate: Nordstrom\u2019s was not the only company that is dropping Ivanka\u2019s merchandise. So have Neiman-Marcus and at least four other retailers. T.J. Maxx, which earlier was reported to have dropped Ivanka merchandise, has said it has incorporated the products into its regular racks, but hasn\u2019t taken them out of inventory.\n\nNordstrom\u2019s, as it happens, has been openly critical of Trump\u2019s immigrant travel ban. The company\u2019s three co-presidents \u2014 brothers Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom \u2014 issued a memo to employees observing that their company was founded by an immigrant, their great-grandfather John W. Nordstrom, and that today it employs thousands of first- and second-generation immigrants.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
