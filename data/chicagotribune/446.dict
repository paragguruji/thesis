Where else would you see them?\u201d\n\nMy second thought was, \u201cOh, brother, the president is typing in all caps again.\u201d\n\nAnd my third thought was, \u201cDoes the president think he\u2019s going to sue the appeals court judges?\u201d\n\nI suppose those thoughts don\u2019t matter much in the final analysis, but they\u2019re fine examples of how our new president breeds confusion, and how that confusion stands in stark contrast to the reasoned opinion the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued against Trump\u2019s ill-conceived travel ban.\n\nPushing back on the administration\u2019s insistence that the executive order \u2014 which created chaos at airports across the country as immigrants, refugees and even some permanent U.S. residents were detained or turned away \u2014 was necessary for reasons of national security.\n\nThe court wrote: \u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, meet Mr. Checks and Mrs. Balances.\n\nCiting an earlier opinion from Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, the appeals court\u2019s opinion also noted that \u201cwhile counseling deference to the national security determinations of the political branches, the Supreme Court has made clear that the Government\u2019s 'authority and expertise in (such) matters do not automatically trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals,\u2019 even in times of war.\u201d\n\nDemocracy is complicated, as Trump is now learning, but it tends to work.\n\nMore legal wrangling will come, and the president and his handlers can squawk and crow all they want \u2014 in all caps and everything \u2014 about activist judges or rogue courts or whatever. But the reality is that this executive order is in peril, particularly with an eight-person U.S. Supreme Court that would likely split along ideological lines, allowing a lower court ruling to stand.\n\nWhich brings us to the second part of Trump\u2019s Twitter response to the ruling: \u201cTHE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nThat is, if I may adopt the president\u2019s preferred format, A DRAMATIC OVERSTATEMENT INTENDED TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO MAKING DECISIONS THAT GO AGAINST OUR VALUES AS A NATION!\n\nEver since a judge placed a stay on Trump\u2019s executive order, the president has been saying that \u201cbad dudes\u201d are pouring into our country, implying that his travel ban was the only thing stopping immigration officials from waving through a phalanx of terrorists.\n\nThat\u2019s utter nonsense. No immigrant or refugee pours into this country, from anywhere. People trying to enter the country under the system in place before the executive order were waiting 18 to 24 months, at least, and additional security screening was performed on refugees coming from Syria.\n\nAnybody saying this order is necessary to prevent hordes of bad dudes from rushing into America is lying.\n\nPer the appeals court\u2019s ruling: \u201cDespite the district court\u2019s and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States\u2019 argument that the district court\u2019s order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump administration can find ways to enhance how we screen people coming into this country and do so in a constitutional manner, that\u2019s great. But this executive order was bungled from the start, poorly thought out, borderline inhumane and a thinly veiled attempt at banning Muslims.\n\nThe court used Trump\u2019s own words against him, in fact, noting that \u201cthe States have offered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.\u201d\n\nCareful what you tweet, Mr. President. Words matter.\n\nAnd living up to our ideals matters as well, no matter how much you try to scare us.\n\nIn its opinion, the appeals court cited text from a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the justices ruled that even in the interest of national security, the government can\u2019t deprive people of constitutional rights: \u201cYet, this concept of \u2018national defense\u2019 cannot be deemed an end in itself, justifying any exercise of legislative power designed to promote such a goal. Implicit in the term \u2018national defense\u2019 is the notion of defending those values and ideals which set this Nation apart.\u201d\n\nWise words. And ones that deserve far more attention than an all-caps tweet from a president aggrieved.\n\nListen to Rex Huppke and WGN radio host Amy Guth discuss presidential politics each week on the \"Guth and Huppke on Politics\" podcast at chicagotribune.com/guthhuppkepodcast.\n\nrhuppke@chicagotribune.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Rex Huppke", "type": "article"}
