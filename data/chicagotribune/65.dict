Eleven [expletive] days. The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public,\" said Stewart.\n\nStewart then returned to his presidential character, reading one final executive order.\n\n\"The reason I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting is because every instinct and fiber of my pathological self-regard calls me to abuse of power,\" he said. \"I want \u2014 no, deserve \u2014 not just your respect, but your adoration. Parades with the tanks and the synchronized dancing, and why can't they train 10,000 doves to spell out 'Trump' in the clouds? How hard can it be, they're already flying?\"\n\n\"It is going to take relentless stamina, vigilance and every institutional check and balance this great country can muster to keep me, Donald J. Trump, from going full Palpatine with the lightning coming out of the fingertips,\" Stewart said, referencing the villainous emperor from the \"Star Wars\" movies.\n\n\"We have never faced this before. Purposeful, vindictive chaos,\" Stewart said pointedly. \"But perhaps therein lies the saving grace of I, Donald J. Trump's presidency.\"\n\n\"No one action will be adequate. All action will be necessary. And if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight, and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact, then I, Donald J. Trump, will have demonstrated the greatness of America, just not the way I thought I was gonna.\"\n\nWatch all of Stewart's impassioned and amusing antics below.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": "Libby Hill", "type": "article"}
