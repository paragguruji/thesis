He told Fox News that such tests are typically used to work out tactics and procedures on a small scale before expanding the screening process nationwide.\n\nhugo.martin@latimes.com\n\nTo read the article in Spanish, click here\n\nTo read more about the travel and tourism industries, follow @hugomartin on Twitter.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-03", "authors": "Hugo Martin", "type": "article"}
