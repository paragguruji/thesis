There were 325,000 people that came into this country over a 24 hour period from another country. 109 of them were stopped for additional screening.\" -- White House press secretary Sean Spicer, press briefing, Jan. 30, 2017\n\n---\n\nTrump and his aides love to cite a small number and a big number in order to minimize the impact of the president's executive order suspending the visas of citizens of seven countries.\n\nBut these figures are incredibly misleading, so let's go through the math.\n\nThe facts\n\nFirst of all, the \"325,000\" figure is pretty meaningless because the number of people who arrive in the United States on a given day is not the issue. The question is how many people from these countries have been affected.\n\nThe \"109\" number is old, and rather dubious. For instance, it does not reflect how many people were prevented from even boarding a plane. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 348 people were denied boarding from the issuance of the executive order Friday through 6 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAn additional 392 green card holders have been processed and admitted to the United States, the agency says. Originally, the White House had said that green card holders would also be blocked from entering, but it reversed itself Sunday under political pressure.\n\nOfficials have not responded to repeated requests for an updated number on the number of people detained at U.S. airports. However, the Daily Beast reported that an additional 200 to 250 people were denied entry once their flights landed -- and they were part of a larger pool of 735 people at ports of entry who could have been barred from entering the United States.\n\nA Google spreadsheet tracking the experience of Iranian travelers has documented the travails of nearly 300 people, with many describing significant delays or negotiation even if they were allowed into the United States.\n\nBut all of these numbers fail to provide the full picture. The real number is about 90,000.\n\nAccording to State Department statistics, that's how many people received either nonimmigrant or immigrant visas from the seven affected countries in fiscal 2015. That's the most recent data available, and different types of visas are available for different lengths of time, but it serves as a usable proxy for the likely universe of people affected by Trump's travel ban. (Moreover, the data does not include people who are dual citizens, such as Dutch-Iranians, who also are impacted by the order.)\n\nCarolyn Kaster / AP White House press secretary Sean Spicer points to a reporter to take a question during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington on Jan. 30, 2017.

Or, if they are in the United States currently, they will not be able to leave and assume that they can return before the travel suspension ends.\n\nHere's the breakdown by country:\n\nIran: 34,819 nonimmigrant visas, 7,179 immigrant visas\n\nIraq: 13,335 nonimmigrant visas, 2,010 immigrant visas\n\nSyria: 9,770 nonimmigrant visas, 1,901 immigrant visas\n\nSudan: 5,039 nonimmigrant visas, 1,642 immigrant visas\n\nYemen: 4,472 nonimmigrant visas, 3,143 immigrant visas\n\nLibya: 3,303 nonimmigrant visa, 272 immigrant visas\n\nSomalia: 399 nonimmigrant visas, 1,078 immigrant visas\n\nThe Pinocchio test\n\nThe Trump White House's figures on the scope of the travel ban are ludicrously low. The universe of people likely affected by the travel suspension is around 90,000 -- not 109.\n\nFour Pinocchios", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Glenn Kessler", "type": "article"}
