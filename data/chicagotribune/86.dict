Today is Thursday, Feb. 2, and here\u2019s what\u2019s happening across California:\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nIn their name\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s controversial travel restrictions, which he said were inspired in part by the San Bernardino terrorist attack, have prompted starkly different reactions from families of the victims. Some, themselves immigrants, question the fairness and effectiveness of the policy, while others support Trump\u2019s efforts as a means to protect the U.S. from terror attacks. Los Angeles Times\n\nLiking Trump\n\nIn parts of California that voted for President Trump, many are pleased at his first week in office. They believe he\u2019s carrying out campaign promises and think all the protests are an overreaction. \u201cSo far I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d one said. Los Angeles Times\n\nShut down\n\nA speech by conservative firebrand and Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled at UC Berkeley on Wednesday amid violent protests on campus that sparked at least one fire.

STORIES\n\nTurned off: Spanish-speaking viewers throughout Los Angeles were stunned Wednesday when they discovered their favorite Spanish-language television station, Univision\u2019s KMEX-TV Channel 34, had been taken off the air \u2014 replaced by a blue screen.

Los Angeles Times\n\nGOVERNMENT AND POLITICS\n\nHollywood fears: The election of President Trump, some say, has increased anxiety in the entertainment industry about how the new administration\u2019s travel and immigration policies will affect visa applications and wait times for filmmakers and crew members who want to work on productions in the United States. Los Angeles Times\n\nTrump vs. California: Federal waivers could be a quick way for President Trump to slow California\u2019s climate change policy. CalMatters\n\nNo on DeVos: Eli Broad, the prominent local philanthropist behind a massive effort to increase the number of charter schools in Los Angeles, is protesting the appointment of Betsy DeVos as secretary of Education.

White, in the annual state of the CSU address Wednesday, spoke of his ongoing commitment to protect vulnerable immigrant students and said access to education is a universal right. \u201cWe will go as far as state and federal laws allow to ensure all students have that opportunity,\u201d White said.
