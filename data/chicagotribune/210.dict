He dealt with the fallout from his travel ban, fired an acting attorney general and welcomed new Cabinet members. Let\u2019s get started:\n\nWe have a secretary of State. The Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nBut there\u2019s bad news on another nominee. Two Republican senators defected and announced they\u2019re voting against Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.\n\nA surprise trip to Dover Air Force Base. Trump was on hand in Delaware to witness the return of the remains of the first confirmed service member killed in action on his watch.\n\nBad information on bad guys? The Associated Press reported that Trump threatened to send U.S. troops into Mexico to stop \u201cbad hombres.\u201d Mexico\u2019s president denied that.\n\nClarity on green cards: White House spokesman Sean Spicer announced that card holders from the seven majority-Muslim countries won\u2019t need special waivers from the travel ban anymore.\n\nMore on the travel ban: Another judge \u2014 this time from L.A. \u2014 issued an emergency order forbidding government officials to enforce the new policy.\n\nIran\u2019s \u201con notice\u201d for bad behavior, according to the White House.\n\nThursday, Feb. 2\n\nRead the room. At the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump asked for prayers for his \u201cApprentice\u201d replacement, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThe ratings went down the tubes. It's been a total disaster, and [producer] Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, OK?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a head-scratcher. The Pentagon concluded that the raid in Yemen that left a Navy SEAL dead probably killed civilians, including children. But the White House called it \u201ca successful operation by all standards.\u201d\n\nAfter Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s speech was canceled at UC Berkeley following violent protests, Trump took to Twitter to suggest that the cancellation was an infringement on freedom of speech. He ended the message on a cryptic note: \u201cNo federal funds?\u201d\n\nKellyanne Conway defended Trump\u2019s immigration order by citing a \u201cmassacre\u201d in Bowling Green, Ky., supposedly masterminded by two Iraqi refugees. No such massacre ever happened. She later corrected herself in a tweet.\n\nFriday, Feb. 3\n\nGood-bye Dodd-Frank? Trump ordered a review of the Wall Street reform law signed by Obama, which tightened regulations on banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Trump called Dodd-Frank \u201ca very negative force\u201d for the economy and said that \u201cwe expect to be cutting a lot out.\u201d\n\nTrump upped the ante with Iran, slapping on sanctions after the Islamic Republic tested a medium-range ballistic missile.\n\nThe numbers are in. Nearly 60,000 visas were revoked under Trump\u2019s travel ban, a government lawyer said.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough? We got you covered on last week too. >>\n\nGrade the president\n\nNow that you\u2019re all caught up, here\u2019s your chance to tell us what you think of Trump as we track his major moves over the next 100 days.\n\nGrading opens every Friday and closes at the end of Monday.
