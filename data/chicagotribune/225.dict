He was looking forward to doing so again in a Freestyle World Cup scheduled for Feb. 16-17 in Kermanshah, Iran.\n\n\"We were supposed to leave next Wednesday,\" he said of the U.S. team. \"USA Wrestling [the national governing body] is still trying to work it out, but as of right now, we don't know.\"\n\nEarlier Friday, Iran issued a statement through Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi that a special committee had reviewed the case of the U.S. team and denied its visit as a response to Trump's executive order. The matter got murkier this week when Iran launched a ballistic missile test.\n\n\"Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran's Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision,\" Nenad Lalovic, president of United World Wrestling, the sport's international ruling body, said in an email to The Associated Press. \"We are currently working to find a solution for the freestyle World Cup as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"We don't think politics [should] have any role in this. But, unfortunately, sometimes you can't control that,\" USA Wrestling Executive Director Rich Bender said.\n\nRey, who competes at 125 kilograms (275 pounds), won his NCAA Division I title in 2011, and competed in Tehran, Iran, in 2014 as part of another U.S. team. USA Wrestling has a long history of wrestling events with Iran since re-establishing the relationship in 1998 after a hiatus of almost 20 years. The U.S. has sent national teams to Iran 15 times since.\n\nThe Allentown family whose reunion with Syrian relatives was blocked without warning Saturday after President Donald Trump imposed a travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries, has joined the nationwide challenges of Trump\u2019s order as unconstitutional religious discrimination.

People were on top of vending booths.\n\n\"Screaming with enthusiasm, and very knowledgeable of the sport,\" he said. \"Win or lose, whoever was on the mat, they had a great appreciation for you because you were a wrestler.\"\n\nEven when world and Olympic champion (2012) Jordan Burroughs beat Iran's top wrestler, Ezzatollah Akbari Zarinkolaei, the fans were enthusiastic and sportsmanlike.\n\n\"Jordan Burroughs beat their world finalist and they gave him the longest standing ovation of the night because they have such a great respect,\" Rey said. \"I was like his bodyguard when we left the arena. People wanted to hug him and get his autograph and get their picture taken with him.\"\n\n\"I love Iran,\" Burroughs told AP. \"I love their people, and I don't get into politics. I wasn't going to make a political stance. I was going to compete.\"\n\nRey said that USA Wrestling and UWW are working on a solution to the situation, perhaps by shifting the date to when the political climate is more appropriate, or to a different country if Iran is amenable to the change.\n\nGary R.
