It was first reported by ABC News.\n\n\"Moreover, such a policy runs counter to core American values of non-discrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants.\"\n\nThe White House was quickly dismissive of the dissent and seemed to suggest the diplomats should quit if they disagree with a policy.\n\nTrump spokesman Sean Spicer said the diplomats' raising of opposition \"does call into question whether or not they should continue\" to work in the State Department.\n\nIt was not clear how many officials would sign the memo.\n\nDissent channel memos are in theory not made public. The mechanism is designed to allow diplomats to offer an alternative policy without fear of retaliation.\n\nActing State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed the existence of the memo but declined to comment on its contents.\n\n\u201cThe dissent channel is a longstanding official vehicle for State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,\" he said. \"... It allows State employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.\u201d\n\nThe agency is still waiting for a boss. Trump's pick for secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week.\n\nThe last time a dissent-channel memo was reported publicly was last year, when about 50 diplomats protested Obama administration policy in Syria, which they described as \"inaction.\"\n\n12:20 p.m.: This story was updated with White House comment.\n\n8:40 a.m.: This story was updated with comment from a State Department spokesman.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Tracy Wilkinson", "type": "article"}
