Kelly, moved to allay the havoc that marked the rollout of the bans over the weekend. They visited Capitol Hill to reach out to Republican lawmakers upset over being excluded while the order was being developed and separately briefed reporters on adjustments to the program.\n\nThey also acknowledged that the disruption was more widespread than previously known, saying 721 travelers were denied boarding on flights to the U.S. But some 872 refugees were exempted from the ban because of undue hardships and will be arriving in the U.S. this week, said Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States,\u201d Kelly told reporters. \u201cAnd a relatively small number right now are being held up for a period of time until we can take a look at what their procedures are.\u201d\n\nKelly pressed forward with Trump\u2019s plans to transform U.S. border policy, saying for the first time that some of the restrictions that caused confusion and sparked protests over the weekend could be extended well into the future.\n\nAmong the countries on the banned list \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen \u2014 many \u201care in various states of collapse,\u201d Kelly said, and have poor record-keeping or unreliable police forces that undermine U.S. border officials\u2019 efforts to determine travelers\u2019 identities and criminal histories.\n\n\"Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon,\" while federal officials review screening procedures for visa applicants from those countries, he said. Trump ordered all travelers from those nations prohibited from entering the U.S. for 90 days; in addition, refugees from Syria are blocked indefinitely and those from any other country are barred for 120 days.\n\nThe list of banned countries may expand; Trump\u2019s order directed Kelly to submit within 60 days a list of additional nations whose citizens should be prohibited from traveling to the U.S. as well.\n\nThe moves signaled that the White House remained committed to remaking border law enforcement while trying to combat the widespread condemnation brought on by Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nWhite House officials were under fire for not giving clear instructions to border officials, which sowed confusion at airports across the country. Senior Trump aides decided to circulate the draft of the order only among a small, tightly controlled group of experts and Cabinet secretaries.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that runs hundreds of immigration checkpoints at the country\u2019s airports and ports of entry, did not prepare instructions for border officials in advance of the order being signed Friday evening. Changes to who would be allowed in the country were made on the spot over the weekend, as were new procedures for awarding waivers from the travel bans while travelers were detained inside airports.\n\n\u201cThe notion that the operators who have to implement this across hundreds of ports of entry would first see this order at 5 p.m. on a Friday is shocking,\u201d said John Sandweg, a former senior immigration official under President Obama.\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like they have only now become aware of the impacts of the policy the drafters didn\u2019t foresee or the White House didn\u2019t foresee,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The rollout of this executive order was terrible,\" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a Trump supporter, blaming the president\u2019s staff for not doing more to predict potential problems.\n\nGOP senators, who were inundated with requests from constituents for assistance, aired their complaints to Vice President Mike Pence, a guest at their weekly lunch at the Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWhite House officials understood that they risk their relationships with Republican lawmakers over how the order was executed, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t know yet is whether it\u2019s a concern or not on their end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be the way they want to roll right now.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the executive order is legal, Corker responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nKelly, McAleenan and other top Homeland Security officials conceded some problems as implementation began, including poor communication. But they maintained that all court orders were followed, rebutted reports that some legal residents were denied access to attorneys at airports and said everyone detained by border agents was treated with \"dignity and respect.\"\n\nThe White House, which has contended that the president\u2019s order was not aimed at Muslims despite Trump promising such a move during his campaign, even backed off from the term \u201cban,\u201d as did Kelly.\n\nTrump used the term as recently as Monday, but facing backlash from many directions, the White House adamantly insisted Tuesday that the word is verboten.\n\n\"This is not a ban,\" Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in a fiery news briefing.\n\n\"When we use words like 'travel ban,'\" he said later, \"that misrepresents what it is. It's seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration, where, frankly, we don't get the information that we need for people coming into this country.\"\n\nSpicer appeared to be making a renewed effort to distinguish the order from the all-out ban on Muslims entering the country that Trump proposed during the campaign, but many around the world see the newest policy as an outgrowth of that proposal.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
