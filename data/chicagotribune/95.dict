Gen. Jeff Sessions testifies before senators today. I'm Davan Maharaj, editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nMueller Under Fire, Sessions Under Oath\n\nHow\u2019s this for a trial balloon? Christopher Ruddy, head of the conservative site Newsmax and a close Trump friend, said the president \u201cis considering perhaps terminating\u201d Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation. \u201cI personally think it would be a very significant mistake,\u201d Ruddy added. Another high-profile ally, Newt Gingrich, seemed to encourage the move. Today we may find out what Sessions has to say about that, as he\u2019ll give public testimony starting at 11:30 a.m. Pacific time before the Senate Intelligence Committee. It\u2019s unclear whether the White House will invoke executive privilege to block Sessions from answering some questions, which will focus on Sessions\u2019 Russian contacts and role in firing FBI Director James Comey. Watch it with us here.\n\nA One-Two Punch Against Trump\u2019s Travel Ban\n\nYou\u2019ve heard this one before: Another federal appeals court has refused to lift a hold on President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Coming on top of the 4th Circuit of Appeals\u2019 ruling, the decision by a 9th Circuit panel of judges (all appointed by President Clinton) gives a second legal basis to block the ban. It\u2019s one that could be more palatable to the Supreme Court, if the case gets that far. Once again, the president\u2019s tweets were used against him in a court of law.\n\nMore From Washington\n\n-- Watch: Trump\u2019s first full Cabinet meeting featured praise from each person at the table, including Reince Priebus\u2019 thanks for \u201cthe opportunity and the blessing you've given us to serve your agenda.\u201d It also inspired a parody video.\n\n-- It\u2019s decision time at the Supreme Court as the justices prepare to hand down the final rulings in 21 cases, including disputes over religion, free speech and immigration. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a concise, pointed essay for his first high court opinion.\n\n-- Trump\u2019s nominee to be a key banking regulator said through a spokesman that he did not misrepresent that he had a degree from Dartmouth College.\n\nBeware the Ides of June\n\nAt the Public Theater\u2019s staging of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d in New York\u2019s Central Park, the Roman tyrant has blond hair, a gold-plated bathtub and a \u201cpouty Slavic wife,\u201d as one critic wrote. Put that together with the fact that the senators in Shakespeare\u2019s play conspire to assassinate Caesar, and you\u2019ve got another firestorm over what crosses the line in the Trump era. The Public Theater\u2019s defense? \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d is an indictment of political violence. It\u2019s also hardly the first time the role has been used to allude to a U.S. president.\n\nJoan Marcus / Associated Press Tina Benko, left, portrays Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, and Gregg Henry, center left, portrays Julius Caesar in the Public Theater's production.

The company has faced complaints of harassment and mismanagement, executive firings and departures, a federal investigation into obstruction of justice and a lawsuit from Google\u2019s self-driving vehicle spinoff. Today, the findings of an internal investigation into its corporate culture will be released. How can it steer its way out of this mess?\n\nThe Fall of the Mall\n\nAt shopping malls across the U.S., the hits just keep coming. Department stores, luxury brands, kids\u2019 clothing retailers \u2014 they\u2019re all suffering the consequences of the profound disruption caused by the continued rise of online shopping. That\u2019s forcing malls to offer more restaurants and other experience-based offerings. Even so, one recent report estimated that 20% to 25% of the nation\u2019s malls would close in the next five years.\n\nMUST-WATCH VIDEO\n\n-- The push to move the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach toward zero-emissions trucks and yard equipment.\n\n-- Actor Gerald McRaney says \u201cThis Is Us\u201d fans aren\u2019t shy about getting personal with him.\n\n-- Scenes from the LA Pride parade and #ResistMarch.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\n-- The Trump administration has canceled proposed limits on the number of endangered whales, dolphins and sea turtles that can be killed or injured by swordfishing nets on the West Coast.\n\n-- State Senate Democrats introduced legislation to change the rules governing recall elections to remove a lawmaker from office, potentially helping one of their own survive.\n\n-- Inside the ICBM launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where a turn of two keys sends a Minuteman III missile flaming toward its target.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-13", "authors": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}
