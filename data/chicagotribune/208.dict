Welcome to the Friday edition of our Essential Politics newsletter, in which we look at the events of the week in Washington and elsewhere in national politics and highlight some particularly insightful stories.\n\nAT WAR WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL\n\nAs with so many of Trump\u2019s problems, his current predicament is largely self-made.\n\nBefore Trump fired James B. Comey from his job as FBI director, the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election seemed to be focusing away from the president.\n\nProsecutors clearly had former national security advisor Michael Flynn in their sights. They reportedly had sought records from Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Closer to home for Trump, the FBI was asking questions about meetings that his son-in-law and advisor, Jared Kushner, had with Russian officials.\n\nBut as Comey, himself, told the president, he was not personally under investigation.\n\nThat no longer appears to be true.\n\nTrump\u2019s firing of Comey brought on Mueller\u2019s appointment, which took the investigation firmly out of the control of Trump\u2019s appointees. Once Mueller took the reins, he inevitably started looking at whether the firing, plus Trump\u2019s reported requests that senior intelligence officials intervene to try to halt the investigation of Flynn, amounted to an abuse of power or an effort to obstruct the investigation.\n\nAs that realization sank in at the White House and as officials began to lawyer up \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is the latest to obtain counsel \u2014 Trump began contemplating firing Mueller.\n\nIt\u2019s a step that may go beyond his legal authority and probably exceeds his current political strength, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from considering it.\n\nOn Monday, Christopher Ruddy, the head of the conservative website Newsmax and a sometime confidant of Trump\u2019s, visited the White House, then went on PBS\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d to say that Trump was thinking about firing Mueller.\n\n\"I personally think it would be a very significant mistake,\" Ruddy said.\n\nWhite House aides scrambled to say that Ruddy wasn\u2019t speaking for the president, and the storm calmed, briefly. On Tuesday, the prospect that the president might move against the special counsel hovered over two Senate hearings that featured Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod J. Rosenstein.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, hours after the shooting of a Republican member of Congress at a congressional baseball practice, the storm blew back in, as strong as ever.\n\nThat evening, news broke that Mueller was taking the unsurprising step of planning to question those senior intelligence officials whose help Trump had sought, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Adm. Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency. Trump fired back in his now-familiar way, as Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman reported.\n\n\u201cYou are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!\u201d Trump declared on Twitter.\n\nThursday morning\u2019s tweets were followed by more on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,\u201d Trump declared, making an apparent reference to Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller\u2019s investigation. His statement, perhaps inadvertently, seemed to confirm that Mueller is investigating possible obstruction of justice.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein said Friday morning that she was \u201cgrowing increasingly concerned\u201d that Trump would try to fire both Mueller and Rosenstein. Trump, she said, was sending a message that \u201che believes the rule of law doesn\u2019t apply to him.\u201d That\u2019s a \u201cblatant violation of the president\u2019s oath of office,\u201d she added.\n\nTrump turned 71 on Wednesday, and his penchant for personalizing issues, painting his opponents as evil and seeking short-term victories even at the expense of his long-term interests are, by now, deeply ingrained.\n\nOver the last year, Republican leaders repeatedly have hoped that someone would emerge who could control that side of Trump. A year ago, they pinned those hopes on Manafort. After he was fired, some thought Kellyanne Conway would control Trump. Others looked to Reince Priebus.\n\nAfter the inauguration, Ivanka Trump and Kushner were supposedly set to play that role. More recently, some on Capitol Hill have hoped that First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s move to Washington would calm the president.\n\nSlowly, the realization has set in that outside control of Trump is simply not possible. As long as he feels under threat \u2014 and perhaps as long as his tenure in office lasts \u2014 he will remain one impetuous tweet away from crisis.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s described himself as a counterpuncher. That muscle memory, that he has that reflex to react when something like this comes up, obviously it\u2019s very strong,\u201d Jim Merrill, a New Hampshire-based consultant for three Republican presidential campaigns, told Bennett and Bierman.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-16", "authors": "David Lauter", "type": "article"}
