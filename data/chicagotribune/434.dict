Perhaps more than any other person, Sessions stands at the nexus of many of the potential plot lines that we should fear most about the Trump presidency.\n\nHere are the possibilities we need to worry about. President Donald Trump's refusal to divest in his business holdings creates the possibility of untold conflicts of interest and even full blown corruption on an unprecedented scale. The hostility of Trump and Republicans to a full, independent probe into Russian meddling in the election may mean there will never be a full public accounting of what happened, which could make a repeat more likely.\n\nTrump's year of lies about voter fraud, and his campaign vows of explicit persecution of minorities, could signal further voter suppression efforts, weakened civil rights protections, and the use of state power against Muslims and undocumented immigrants in draconian or discriminatory ways. Trump's well documented authoritarian impulses could conceivably tip him into genuine authoritarian rule, in which, for instance, the power of the state is turned against critics or political opponents.\n\nSessions is now in a unique position to facilitate and enable \u2014 or, by contrast, to act as a legal check on \u2014 all of these possibilities, should they metastasize (or metastasize further) into serious threats to vulnerable minorities or, more broadly, to our democracy. Here are the things to fear:\n\n1. Sessions' loyalty to Trump. Steve Bannon has said: \"Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda.\" The question is what this will loyalty will mean for the new attorney general's independence from the Trump White House.\n\nThe Post notes this week that Sessions has \"repeatedly declined to say whether he would recuse himself from an investigation\" that involves Trump campaign associates and Russian electoral interference. His handling of the specter of Trump corruption is also a big unknown.\n\n2. The possibility of more voter suppression efforts and weakened civil rights protections. If Trump does join with congressional Republicans to push more voter suppression efforts on the national level, the attorney general might be at the center of that. The Justice Department could refuse to enforce key remaining provisions of the Voting Rights Act, or launch crackdowns on voter fraud that are designed to purge voter rolls, harming real voters.\n\nMeanwhile, it will bear watching whether the Sessions Justice Department guts the department's Civil Rights Division or scales back the department's focus on police misconduct. Civil rights groups are already alarmed by the Trump Justice Department's decision to delay cases involving a challenge to a Texas voter ID law and a push to reform the Baltimore Police Department.\n\n3. Crackdowns on Muslims, undocumented immigrants, and even critics. The Trump Justice Department is already aggressively defending Trump's immigration ban in court. The discriminatory intent of this seems obvious already. But if it were to be extended and expanded to more Muslim majority countries, the Justice Department would then be clearly defending what is, in effect, a Muslim ban. Meanwhile, the Justice Department might have a hand in a revived registry for people from Muslim-majority countries, which remains possible. And Justice Department lawyers will opine on the legality of any other policies that might target Muslims.\n\nMeanwhile, Sessions is an ardent opponent of reasonable immigration reforms that would create paths to legalization for undocumented immigrants and favors restrictions on legal immigration as well. Sessions is expected to lead Trump's charge against \"sanctuary cities\" that decline to cooperate with federal deportation efforts, and there are multiple other ways in which Sessions could influence legal proceedings to maximize deportations. Separately, The Atlantic's David Frum has floated a scenario in which Justice Department antitrust actions function as a way to pressure or harass news organizations, though that seems remote.\n\n4. Sessions' worldview. All of the above admittedly represent dire scenarios, and we do not know if anything like them will actually materialize. However, Sessions is also at the center of another big storyline, one that is centered on enduring questions about the true nature of Trumpism itself. The unknown is whether Trumpism will fulfill the worst fears of its critics and function as a blueprint for a Trump agenda that is not just anti-globalist in economic terms and driven by justifiable skepticism about immigration, but rather one that is fundamentally ethno-nationalist or white nationalist in orientation.\n\nIt's hard to say how or whether we will know this is happening, if it does, but ultimately the aggregation of various individual initiatives may add up to a clear indicator. Bannon has declared that Sessions \"has played a critical role as the clearinghouse\" for the \"policy and philosophy\" at the core of the \"populist nation-state policies\" otherwise known as Trumpism, and that he has been \"at the forefront of this movement for years.\"\n\nSessions is now in a remarkably good position to help translate this \"philosophy\" into reality. And we may now see what that philosophy actually looks like in the real world \u2014 for better or, more likely, for much, much worse.\n\nWashington Post\n\nGreg Sargent writes The Plum Line blog, a reported opinion blog with a liberal slant \u2014 what you might call \u201copinionated reporting\u201d from the left.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCan anyone stop Steve Bannon's power grab?\n\nTravel ban is the clearest sign yet of Trump advisers' intent to reshape the country\n\nDonald Trump's war on his own credibility A fear of immigrants?
