Last weekend, Trump denounced a federal judge in Seattle who had temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order suspending immigration and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nA three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco heard arguments Tuesday on the government\u2019s effort to lift the stay. The judges did not issue an immediate ruling, and Trump complained Wednesday that the legal process was taking too long.\n\n\u201cYou could be a lawyer, or you don't have to be a lawyer. If you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this, and it\u2019s really incredible to me that we have a court case that\u2019s going on so long,\u201d Trump told a police chiefs\u2019 conference in Washington.\n\nThe legal battle over the travel ban is expected to wind up in the Supreme Court.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": "Del Quentin Wilber", "type": "article"}
