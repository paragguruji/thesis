Devin Nunes (R-Tulare) released a statement Sunday night saying some tweaks are needed, but his background as chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee leads him to support the executive order.\n\n\"In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe\u2019s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump administration\u2019s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland. While accommodations should be made for green card holders and those who\u2019ve assisted the U.S. armed forces, this is a useful temporary measure on seven nations of concern until we can verify who is entering the United States,\" he said.\n\nRep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) told the Washington Post that \"pausing the intake of refugees from terror hotspots is the right call to keep America safe,\" but he hopes the cases of people traveling on visas who were prevented from reentering the country are resolved quickly.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) said on Twitter on Sunday that the rollout has created confusion, and that executive orders aren't the way to fix the country's long-term problems.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Sarah D.
