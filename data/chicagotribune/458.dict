Another 223 students at UCF and 25 Valencia College students from the affected countries have also been warned not to leave the country.\n\nThe UCF doctoral student is from Iran and studies as the College of Engineering and Computer Science, UCF spokesman Chad Binette said. His name was not released.\n\nUniversity President John Hitt called education \u201c an instrument of diplomacy\u201d and urged students, faculty and staff who might be affected by the order to avoid leaving the U.S.\n\n\u201cAt its core, a university\u2019s mission is to cultivate talent and ability without regard to religion, national origin, and other factors. I believe diversity and inclusivity make our university smarter and stronger,\u201d Hitt wrote in a message to students.\n\nAnother 223 students at UCF were addressed in a letter that was sent out to international students and faculty Friday by the UCF Global senior staff.\n\n\u201cWe urge members of our community affected by this anticipated ban to avoid any travel outside of the U.S. during this time,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cDuring times of uncertainty, it is important to know that you are not alone or isolated in your concern. Know that we stand with you.\u201d\n\nIn addition, 25 Valencia College students are from the countries targeted by the ban, spokeswoman Linda Shrieves Beaty said.\n\nAn Iranian graduate student studying at Florida State University is also overseas and unable to return, president John Thrasher said in a statement, in addition to about 60 students currently in Tallahassee who were advised to stay in the country until further notice.\n\nAt the University of Florida, 167 students with visas are affected by the ban, a spokeswoman said.\n\nRollins College does not have any current students from the countries affected, a spokeswoman said.\n\nOfficials said they weren\u2019t aware of any additional travelers held at Orlando International Airport, one day after three green card holders on a flight from Dubai were stopped by Customs officers at Orlando International Airport on Saturday and held for about seven hours.\n\nThe travelers \u2014 a Syrian couple visiting their son, and an Iranian returning home to Oviedo \u2014 were eventually allowed into the country.\n\nImmigration attorney Mario Musil said Sunday he was aware of six held at Port Canaveral.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it doesn\u2019t anticipate any further travelers stopped, because it\u2019s working with airlines to prevent those in question from boarding international flights.\n\nIn a letter to Trump released Monday, state House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O' Lakes, threatened to end the refugee program that brought in 700 people from Syria and 300 people from Iraq \u2014 two of the countries affected by the ban \u2014 to Florida in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe find the present arrangement for this program unacceptable and an abrogation of our duty to protect the safety of Florida residents,\u201d he said. \u201cConsequently, the Florida House of Representatives is seriously re-evaluating Florida's role in these programs.\u201d\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson stated in a letter to Trump that the order \u201cwill only undermine our counterterrorism efforts,\u201d while Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said he was \u201cuneasy\u201d and had \u201cunanswered questions and concerns.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress, meanwhile, were split down party lines when it came to the order.\n\nU.S. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, was at the airport Sunday to assist the three people who were detained.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is that this order is over-broad, it's un-American and it's unconstitutional as so many courts have pointed out,\u201d Soto said in a statement. \u201cI think it puts our country at greater threat.\u2019\u2019\n\nU.S Reps. Stephanie Murphy, D-Winter Park, and Val Demings, D-Orlando, also criticized the order.\n\nOn the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Bill Posey of Rockledge said in a statement that \u201callowing unvetted immigration into the United States when we have been told there will be terrorists among them is risky and dangerous.\u201d Rep. Dan Webster said he was \u201cthankful to see President Trump is taking his responsibility to protect our country seriously and putting Americans\u2019 safety first.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Palm Coast, looked more to the future, stating, \u201cI hope that, during the 90 day period outlined in the President\u2019s executive order, the administration develops policies that will better protect the American people from this potent threat.\u201d\n\nStaff writers Gabrielle Russon and Leslie Postal contributed to this report.\n\nAuthorities release three held at OIA after flight from Dubai \u00bb", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Steven Lemongello, Ryan Gillespie", "type": "article"}
