He weighed in on a variety of topics, from the media (\"dishonest and disgusting\") to waterboarding (\"really wasn't torture\") to the border wall (\"necessary\").\n\nTrump also took aim at Madonna's controversial speech at the Women's March on Washington.\n\n\"Honestly, she\u2019s disgusting. I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,\" Trump said.\n\nIn her speech Saturday, Madonna told the crowd, \"Yes, I\u2019m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\"\n\nThe singer continued, \"But I know that this won't change anything. We cannot fall into despair.\"\n\nMadonna later took to Instagram to clarify her remarks.\n\n\"I am not a violent person,\" she wrote. \"I do not promote violence, and it\u2019s important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Libby Hill", "type": "article"}
