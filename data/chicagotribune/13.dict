What this really means though, since most of the people from the six visa-banned countries aren\u2019t likely to be coming for a tour through the American countryside, is that we are refusing entry to those who need it most.\n\nAnd it has gotten me thinking about firefighters, good neighbors and what it means to be American.\n\nMy toddler loves fire trucks. He loves mimicking the noise they make. I think most kids feel this way, because fire trucks are cool and firefighters are heroes \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t love a hero narrative? The concept of firefighters encompasses something very American: They are courageous, they protect those who need help, they are heroes.\n\nCity firefighters battle a 3-alarm blaze at a building under construction at Gay and Federal streets in downtown Baltimore Monday night.

But at some point his interest in fire trucks will probably lead to the disconcerting recognition that heroes exist because the world can be terrible. At some point he\u2019ll worry: What if our house caught fire?\n\nAnd I\u2019ll comfort him and tell him that we\u2019ll do everything we can to be smart and to practice fire safety, and tell him that we would call 9-1-1, and firefighters would come to help. In the meantime, we would run over to a neighbor\u2019s house to wait. The concept of good neighbors, too, encompasses something very American: They are welcoming, they help one another when in need, they are make a community.\n\nWith some exceptions, any citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, and any refugees from anywhere around the world, are temporarily banned from entering our country. Refugees, who themselves are fleeing horror, are banned from seeking refuge in our country. Hardy Vieux, the legal director of Human Rights First, says that these refugees \u201chave strong reasons to look to the United States for protection\u201d \u2014 protection that we will not provide. Mr. Vieux also says that by banning their entry, we will \u201cleave refugees stranded in difficult and dangerous situations abroad.\u201d\n\nWe have become the neighbors who keep their door shut, and say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure about you guys, who come from a burning home. Maybe you\u2019re the kind of people who start fires yourselves (and I do have a lot of matches in my house), so I don\u2019t want to chance it. But you can wait outside, until we figure this thing out.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr. posted an image to Twitter that compared Syrian refugees to a lethal bowl of Skittles.

I do think our loyalties should extend to our own countrymen first, because there are, in fact, some bad hombres out there, ridiculous word choice notwithstanding. I\u2019m also not proposing that I have a better plan for how to reconcile the American values of courage, protection of others, heroism, welcoming, helping those in need and a sense of community with the world, with the growing terror in our country. (It\u2019s also not my job to develop such a plan.)\n\nBut imposing a blanket ban on people seeking sanctuary from the very kind of terror that we condemn, is definitely not the right way to do it. Anyone who can think for themselves should be able to see that.\n\nSo we\u2019ll keep an eye to the Supreme Court, and think about a time when we cared about being the heroes and being good neighbors. And we\u2019ll play with toy fire trucks and read books about firefighters, while outside, those trapped in their burning countries are banned from what was once the land of the free.\n\nPunita Chhabra Rice is director of ISAASE, org (Improving South Asian American Students' Experiences); her email is punita@jhu.edu.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "authors": "Punita Chhabra Rice", "type": "article"}
