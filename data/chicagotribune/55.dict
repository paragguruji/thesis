It\u2019s time to engage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter who you voted for \u2014 red or blue, whether you\u2019re white, black, or brown, or all the colors of the identity rainbow, this is our time to resist,\u201d she continued, eliciting cheers from the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s our time to show up and demand answers. It\u2019s our time to tell our elected officials to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe rally marked a stark departure from the usual pre-Oscars circuit, in a week when every studio or agency with a nominee to fete competes to throw their own lavish soirees in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s ceremony.\n\nAt UTA, that tradition was interrupted when Iranian director Asghar Farhadi announced that he would be protesting President Trump\u2019s immigration travel ban by not attending Sunday\u2019s Oscars, where he is nominated for Best Foreign Language film for \u201cThe Salesman.\u201d\n\nThe company nixed its own Oscar bash altogether, opting instead to host the \u201cUnited Voices\u201d rally featuring its own A-list clients and guest speakers from around the world.\n\n\u201cHaving a big fun celebration to celebrate the accomplishments of our industry just didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer told the Times. \u201cI have nothing against parties, but I felt that this could also be a moment to stand up and say, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong. This doesn\u2019t feel right. And we need to pay attention to how this feels at this time in this country.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times Lt.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee received $320,000 in donations from the event, including $250,000 from UTA and $70,000 raised through the agency\u2019s CrowdRise crowdfunding campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to educate,\u201d Key said, addressing his fellow artists. \u201cWe have the ability to inspire. We have the ability to effect change, to bring people together, and to even sometimes bring light when there\u2019s a whole lot of darkness.\u201d\n\nKirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times Actor Keegan-Michael Key at UTA's United Voices rally Actor Keegan-Michael Key at UTA's United Voices rally (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who have been given the mantle to tell everybody\u2019s story,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhether you be trans, whether you be black, whether you be Latino, whether you be disabled \u2014 we\u2019re here to be a platform for you.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom and former U.K. Foreign Secretary and now-IRC head David Miliband also spoke, as did UTA clients Reza Aslan, Michael J. Fox, and Wilmer Valderrama.\n\nKirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times Asghar Farhadi delivers taped remarks from Iran during UTA Rally in Los Angeles.

Let\u2019s fight the deportation machine. Let\u2019s fight the attack on women\u2019s right to an abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s fight the attack on transgender students\u2019 rights to exist. Let\u2019s stand together, for each other.\u201d\n\nAs the rally swelled to an nearly 2,000 estimated attendees, according to organizers, a handful of pro-Trump supporters walked defiantly together through the crowd.\n\nDean, who declined to give his full name, traveled from San Pedro to protest the rally\u2019s pro-immigration message after hearing about the event the day before. \u201cWhat brought me out here was Gavin Newsom,\u201d he said, holding an American flag. \u201cHis policies are offensive to me \u2014 the biggest one is his infringement on the2nd Amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against illegal immigration, too,\u201d he added.\n\nKirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times Protestors rally at United Talent Agency's United Voices rally.

(Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nHarim Uzziel of Los Angeles wore a \u201cTrump: Make America Great Again\u201d shirt and hat and also expressed support of Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cI\u2019m a Latino and I go hardcore for Mr. Trump. I thought he was a racist at first, I believed all the news and the media, but then I did my research, and I\u2019ve been on the Trump train hardcore full throttle since.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming majority of attendees, many of whom held anti-Trump signs, were not of like mind to the small \u201cMAGA\u201d contingent. A hush fell over the gathering when the rally\u2019s special guest, filmmaker Farhadi, appeared via video from Tehran to deliver a minute-long address.\n\n\u201cIt is comforting to know that at a time when some politicians are trying to promote hate by creating divisions between cultures, religions and nationalities, the cinema community has joined the people in a commendable show of unity to announce its opposition,\u201d he said in his first public appearance since announcing his Oscars protest. \u201cI hope this unity will continue and spread to fight other injustices.\u201d\n\nMore scenes from UTA\u2019s United Voices rally:\n\nKirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times Keith James, center, of RefuseFascism.Org, holds up a sign during the United Voices rally outside United Talent Agency headquarters.
