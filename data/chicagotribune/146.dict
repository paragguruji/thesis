But going against Trump administration policy, the ruling expands the exceptions to include travelers who have grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law in the U.S.\n\nThe judge also said that contrary to government policy, refugees cannot be blocked if they have \u201cformal assurance\u201d from U.S. resettlement agencies for relocation to the country \u2014 even if the refugees do not have relatives in the U.S.\n\nThe administration\u2019s implementation of the ban\u2019s limits represented \u201cthe antithesis of common sense,\u201d the judge said.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions accused Watson of trying to \u201cmicromanage\u201d the president\u2019s authority over ensuring national security.\n\n\u201cBy this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nIn the meantime, unless a higher court intervenes, Watson\u2019s decision means that potentially thousands of refugees who had been vetted for U.S. admission but were blocked after the government cut off most refugee admissions on Wednesday \u2014 the day the country hit a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year \u2014 may now be let in.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the decision and will be in consultation with DOJ to ensure immediate implementation,\u201d the Department of State said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice also said in a court filing Friday that it was challenging Watson\u2019s order in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nRefugee resettlement groups and immigrant advocates on Friday celebrated Watson\u2019s decision.\n\nThe order \u201crepresents relief for over 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the U.S. and assigned to resettlement agencies. Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,\u201d Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. The group is among those suing the administration over the ban.\n\n\u201cThis decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely,\u201d Heller said. \u201cNevertheless, we will continue to fight for our refugee clients, who are still affected by the government\u2019s attempts to freeze refugee resettlement.\u201d\n\nFor two weeks, the Trump administration and the state of Hawaii have fought repeatedly in federal courts over whom the ban can block.\n\nAt issue is how to determine which travelers have \u201cclose\u201d relatives living in the U.S. or are associated with the country in other ways that let them bypass the ban \u2014 standards set by the Supreme Court when it lifted the previous halt on enforcement of the ban.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order halts travel by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran but allows exceptions for those with what the Supreme Court called \u201cbona fide\u201d connections with the U.S. The government has said those connections include a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and in-law parents.\n\nBut the administration said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law are not close enough to qualify for admission during the duration of the order. Attorneys for the state of Hawaii successfully petitioned Watson to order the government to count all of those categories as \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. connections.\n\nIn the case of refugees, state lawyers argued that a refugee resettlement organization\u2019s interactions with a refugee constitute a bona fide relationship. The administration disagreed.\n\nHawaii's win came after it was twice rejected in court attempts to weaken the ban.\n\nOn July 6, Watson denied a request from the state to \"clarify\" exceptions to the ban, saying that he did not have the authority to interpret Supreme Court orders. The next day, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar request from the state, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the matter.\n\nBut appellate judges told challengers that they could try a different legal maneuver in the district court. Judges said Hawaii attorneys could request Watson to issue an injunction against the ban's implementation or modify an injunction he had issued that previously had halted the ban before his order was partially lifted by the Supreme Court. Hawaii filed both requests last week.\n\nThe travel ban calls for a three-month pause on travel to the U.S. by nationals of the six Muslim-majority countries and a four-month halt on all refugee resettlement.\n\nWatson was one of the judges who granted a restraining order blocking implementation. His order was issued in a case filed in March by the state of Hawaii.\n\nSuccessful challenges in that case and another filed in a Maryland federal court were upheld in the 9th Circuit and 4th Circuit appellate courts before requests were made to the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ban.\n\nOn June 26, the Supreme Court said the ban could be put back into place with exceptions, but left it up to the government to define most of them. The court indicated its move was a temporary measure until justices hear full arguments on Trump\u2019s executive order in the fall.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
