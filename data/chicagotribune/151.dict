Yet they questioned her son for an hour and 45 minutes, Mancini said, repeatedly asking him: \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d \"Are you a Muslim?\" and \"Where did you get your name from?\"\n\nAli, a Muslim, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Philadelphia in 1972.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said that the agency could not discuss individual travelers due to the restrictions of the Privacy Act. \u201cAll international travelers arriving in the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection,\u201d the agency added in an email.\n\nMancini, a former assistant U.S. attorney, said the questions struck him as \"profile questions,\" potentially violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as well as the 1st and 14th Amendments of the Constitution.\n\nAli\u2019s experience, he said, appeared to be a direct result of President Trump\u2019s efforts to subject Muslims entering the country to \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not discriminate on the basis of religion \u2014 that\u2019s been one of the basic, foundational principles of life in America since this country was founded \u2014 and then along comes Donald Trump, who pledges in his campaign that he\u2019s going to ban all Muslims,\u201d Mancini said.\n\nDuring his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order that temporarily suspended travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations to the U.S. That order has been blocked by federal courts, but administration officials say they will soon introduce new travel restrictions targeting countries with links to terrorism.\n\nMancini, who is trying to collect information about similar cases for a possible federal lawsuit, said Ali\u2019s experience suggested federal agents were using their discretion to broaden the scope of border inspections.\n\n\u201cThe White House can\u2019t get this done by executive order,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cI believe we\u2019re starting to see that they have a program in place to do this through executive action, through the agencies he controls \u2014 Homeland Security, immigration, customs. Muhammad Ali Jr., he just stepped into that.\u201d\n\nAli is not the first traveler to complain about treatment by immigration officials in Fort Lauderdale under the Trump administration.\n\nEarlier this month, Stacy-Marie Ishmael, a reporter who has worked for Buzzfeed and the Financial Times, reported on Twitter that her Trinidadian husband, a U.S. permanent resident, was detained for more than three hours at the Fort Lauderdale airport. Border agents quizzed him about his ethnicity and \u201chow he got his name,\u201d Ishmael said.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
