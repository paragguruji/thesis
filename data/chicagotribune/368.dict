Sessions announced his recusal shortly after he became attorney general and a day after The Washington Post revealed that he had twice met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign and did not disclose that fact to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his January confirmation hearing.\n\nTrump learned of the attorney general's decision shortly before Sessions announced it at a news conference. The president's anger has lingered for months, according to the people close to the White House, who said Trump blames Sessions's recusal as a factor that prompted the decision last month by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel, Robert Mueller, to oversee the expanding Russian investigation.\n\nTrump has also grown frustrated with the way his travel ban has been stalled in federal courts, the people added.\n\nIt is unclear when Sessions offered to resign, and Trump refused the offer. The moment was brief and Sessions made the suggestion after weeks of Trump's disgruntlement and tense private meetings, according to the two people close to the White House who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Trump made clear to Sessions that while he did not like Sessions' decision to recuse himself, these people said, he still had faith in his attorney general.\n\nSessions' offer to resign was first reported by ABC News. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, who was with Sessions in Atlanta Tuesday, declined to comment.\n\nStill, tensions linger. On Monday, Trump derided the revised travel ban and criticized his own Justice Department's handling of the controversial case. In a series of tweets, Trump called the new ban \"politically correct,\" and said the Justice Department should seek a \"much tougher version.\"\n\nErik S.

Lesser / EPA)\n\nBefore his recusal from the Russia investigation, Sessions and Trump had a strong bond. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump early in the presidential campaign last year when few Republican lawmakers supported the candidate.\n\nTrump and Sessions share a similar world view on key issues, including crime and immigration. In the Senate, Sessions crusaded for a hard-line stance on immigration and continues to speak out about arresting and prosecuting illegal immigrants as he travels across the country.\n\nTrump spoke of rising crime in his inaugural address and vowed to end the \"American carnage.\" Sessions has made a tough crackdown on crime his top priority, reversing the Obama administration's charging policy and directing his federal prosecutors to pursue the most severe penalties possible, including mandatory minimum sentences, in a step toward a return to the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "authors": "Robert Costa and Sari Horwitz", "type": "article"}
