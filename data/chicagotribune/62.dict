{"title": "Paging Dr. Price, come to the White House courtesy phone. The president would like to berate you now", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-ed-tom-price-out-of-favor-20170926-story.html", "text": "If it hadn\u2019t done so already, the clock started ticking Monday on Dr. Tom Price\u2019s tenure as head of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe signs are all there. On Sunday, after defending Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin against an ABC News report that he\u2019d used a costly military jet to fly from New York to Washington, President Trump declined to offer similar support for his HHS secretary, who has run up huge bills chartering private jets for his business travel this year. \u201cAs far as Secretary Price is concerned, that\u2019s different,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it.\u201d\n\nPolitico, which broke the story about Price\u2019s use of private jets, reported over the weekend a new tally for Price\u2019s trips: $400,000 since May. Price has defended his preference for the costly charters despite the bad \u201coptics\u201d \u2014 as a House member, Price had blasted former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s use of government planes to travel to and from her Bay Area district \u2014 but pledged on Fox News to stop using them. \u201cWe want to make certain that we have the full confidence not just of this administration, but the American people,\" Price said.\n\nOne sure sign that you\u2019re out of favor is when [Trump] jokes about someone else doing your job better than you\u2019ve been doing it.\n\nWhen it comes to the confidence of the administration, it might be a little late. On Monday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders distanced the Oval Office from Price\u2019s travel proclivities. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t White House-approved travel,\u201d Sanders said, evidently trying to sever any connection implied by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway\u2019s presence on a number of Price\u2019s flights. Then, after saying private planes might be appropriate in certain instances, Sanders declined to say whether she thought Price\u2019s choices had been appropriate.\n\n\u201cThat travel wouldn\u2019t have gone through the White House for approval, and so I couldn\u2019t speak to that,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nJust imagine what she would have said had the alleged transgressor been one of the president\u2019s (current) favorites. Like Mnuchin, who went out of his way on ABC News on Sunday to defend the president\u2019s profane attack on NFL players who don\u2019t stand for the national anthem. OK, it can be hard to tell who\u2019s in Trump\u2019s good graces from day to day, but one sure sign that you\u2019re out of favor is when he jokes about someone else doing your job better than you\u2019ve been doing it.\n\nWhich is what the president appeared to do Monday, when he ceremonially signed a memorandum on increasing access to science, technology, engineering and math education. Trump handed his pen to \u201ca very special woman who has worked so hard on this,\u201d Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee.\n\n\u201cI think we'll put her in charge of healthcare,\u201d Trump said to laughter from the group. \u201cIt'll get done, right?\u201d\n\nPrice has been the White House\u2019s point person on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, but the proposal he backed couldn\u2019t even win the support of his former House colleagues until Trump jumped in and pressed for its passage. A modified version \u2014 also backed by Price and Trump \u2014 is on life support in the Senate. According to Politico, several administration officials have been grumbling about Price jetting out of Washington to work on disaster response instead of trying to line up GOP votes for the latest proposal, by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and three colleagues.\n\nEven if the repeal-and-replace legislation dies this week in the Senate as expected, the HHS will still have plenty on its plate as it works to undermine enrollment through the state Obamacare exchanges \u2014 for example, by shutting down the HealthCare.gov website every Sunday night during the open enrollment period, or by keeping insurers guessing about whether they\u2019ll be reimbursed for providing the subsidies for out-of-pocket costs that the Affordable Care Act requires them to provide to poorer customers.\n\nBut that sounds like a job anyone could do. No need for a medical degree or a chartered jet.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
