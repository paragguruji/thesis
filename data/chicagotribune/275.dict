That ban was announced last month and was published Wednesday in the Federal Register. That triggers a month-long period before it takes effect.\n\nThe warning says exceptions to the travel ban need special permission that will only be granted \"under very limited circumstances.\" The State Department says it doesn't yet know when it will release information on how to apply for an exception.\n\nPrevious U.S. travel warnings also urged Americans not to travel to North Korea.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-02", "authors": "Josh Lederman", "type": "article"}
