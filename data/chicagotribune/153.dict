The administration\u2019s response was due at 3 p.m. Pacific time. A panel ruling could come anytime after that \u2014 most likely within a week, experts said.\n\nIn the meantime, the judges probably are already doing legal research on the issues.\n\nThe three judges who happen to be sitting on the 9th Circuit\u2019s motions panel this month and who will rule on the case are William Canby Jr., a President Carter appointee; Richard Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush; and Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Obama.\n\nClifton is considered moderately conservative and the two Democrats are viewed as moderately liberal. The 9th Circuit is broadly viewed as the most liberal federal appeals court.\n\nThe panel\u2019s decision will not determine whether Trump's order is constitutional. The court will decide whether an emergency hold should remain in force against the order until the constitutional issues are decided.\n\nIf the court decides to continue to block the ban, travelers who already have visas may continue to enter the U.S.\n\nIn issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump's directive, the federal court in Washington state determined the states that challenged the ban would suffer immediate and irreparable harm in employment, business, education, familial relations and freedom to travel.\n\nSome legal experts have described the dispute as uncharted, both in the legal sense and in the extraordinary scope of the travel ban.\n\nIf Trump loses, he could immediately go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who handles matters from the 9th Circuit, would probably ask the other justices to weigh in.\n\nThe Supreme Court could issue a decision immediately, though it normally asks for written arguments. If the court were to tie 4-4 \u2014 the Senate has not yet confirmed Trump\u2019s nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 the 9th Circuit decision would prevail.\n\nThe case before the 9th Circuit stems from a challenge by the state of Washington, which Minnesota quickly joined. The states argued the ban would harm their economies and colleges.\n\nJose Romero / AFP/Getty Images U.S. District Judge James L. Robart issued the nationwide hold on President Trump's travel ban.

Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, ruled in favor of the states. He cited a 5th Circuit decision that blocked an Obama executive order on immigration.\n\nThe 5th Circuit decision against Obama\u2019s directive, which would have protected certain immigrants from deportation, became law when the Supreme Court tied 4-4 after reviewing it.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed Robart\u2019s decision to the 9th Circuit, which decides legal matters for nine Western states.\n\nIn his order, Robart emphasized that the United States has three equal branches of government.\n\n\u201cThe work of the Judiciary, and this court, is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country\u2019s laws, and more importantly, our Constitution,\u201d Robart wrote.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, suggested Sunday that the 9th Circuit was likely to rule against the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cVirtually every judge to consider the executive order has said that there is a substantial likelihood that it is unconstitutional,\u201d Chemerinsky said in an email. \u201cBoth Republican and Democratic appointees have come to this conclusion. Having read some of the briefs in these cases, I think any court is likely to come to this conclusion.\u201d\n\nChemerinsky said predicting what the Supreme Court justices will do amounts to guesswork.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is that they are unlikely to get involved at this early stage, especially with virtually all the lower courts coming out the same way,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has prevailed in at least one case, though, when a federal judge in Boston refused to extend an order prohibiting officials from detaining or deporting people with valid visas or green cards.\n\nThe suit had been filed on behalf of two University of Massachusetts professors from Iran, who subsequently were admitted to the U.S.\n\nThe decision by Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, said the American Civil Liberties Union had failed to show that the initial restraining order was needed after the Trump administration revised the ban.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
