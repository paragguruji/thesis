The government is getting into the business mode on a fast track and this is where Trump comes from. He wants to make a lot of deals. Saudi Arabian leaders understand this language and they\u2019re excited,\u201d said Ahmed Alibrahim, a Saudi businessman who lobbies his government on behalf of U.S. companies.\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will host Trump at a summit on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe GCC countries are not only excited about Trump, but the people he\u2019s chosen to have around him,\u201d said Alibrahim, who dismissed Obama as \u201cthe worst president ever,\u201d unwilling to confront Iran and its Shiite Muslim proxies in Syria and neighboring Yemen, whom the Sunni leaders of the Gulf see as rivals.\n\n\u201cWe suffered for the past eight years a weak America,\u201d Alibrahim said.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s advisors had previous connections to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis served as commander of U.S. Central Command, which includes the Middle East. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in his past role as chief executive of ExxonMobil, maintained deep business ties with Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter.\n\nSaudis, at least at the official level, appear eager to move past the Obama administration\u2019s focus on human rights, including its frequent talk of promoting the standing of women in a kingdom where their ability to vote, run for office, own property, travel and even drive is less than that of men.\n\nHoda Helassi, one of 30 women appointed to the Saudi monarchy\u2019s 150-member consultative council, said Obama failed to take into account how much progress Saudi women have made.\n\n\u201cWe have fought for our modern rights and we are getting them,\u201d said Helassi, who planned to participate in a panel discussion and attend meetings with Ivanka Trump this weekend.\n\n\u201cThere is an air of positiveness, an atmosphere of hope with this visit and I hope it pans out,\u201d Helassi said. \u201cThere are more areas of common ground than there were before. It\u2019s this administration understanding the necessity to change at the pace of Saudi society. A lot of what happened in the past was not understanding why or where we are.\u201d\n\nGulf leaders see Trump as a businessman first, a president who has pursued a transactional foreign policy that fits with their notion of how deals get done. That includes what\u2019s shaping up to be a $100-billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia and a $40-billion Saudi investment in Trump\u2019s domestic infrastructure plan.\n\nTillerson, signaled in March that the Trump administration would lift the Obama-era restrictions on a $2.8-billion sale of U.S. fighter jets and other arms to Bahrain, imposed over human rights concerns.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump is doing is resetting that relationship.\u201d said Faisal Abbas, editor of the Jidda-based Arab News.\n\nTrump will have to tread lightly, given his recent proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and anti-Muslim rhetoric, which provoked outcry in the Middle East.\n\nBut the president\u2019s policies on Iran and Syria, welcomed by Gulf Arabs, and the many business deals in the offing, are likely to mute any potential criticism here in the Gulf. His expected speech to Arab leaders about Islam on Sunday, seen by some as a potential diplomatic minefield, will likely register as little more than \u201cbackground noise,\u201d said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.\n\nThe president successfully hosted several Arab leaders earlier this year, including Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi, a former general criticized for jailing dissidents and other rights violations.\n\n\u201cTrump is a welcome change from Barack Obama because he does not remind them, does not pressure them, about American values and ideas about human rights and democracy. This president is a hardcore realist: He just doesn\u2019t care. This goes well with many leaders in this part of the world,\u201d Gerges said.\n\nTrump has already impressed Gulf Arab leaders by escalating the war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and supporting the Saudi fight against Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n\u201cWhat the Trump team is trying to do is send a message near and far that Trump\u2019s doctrine \u2018America First\u2019 does not necessarily contradict American leadership overseas, particularly in the Middle East,\u201d Gerges said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to reassure America\u2019s allies that America has their back.\u201d\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Trump\u2019s decision to make his first state visit to the Gulf demonstrates just that.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "authors": "Molly Hennessy-Fiske", "type": "article"}
