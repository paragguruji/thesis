The rejection came just before the former president signed an international agreement on global warming in Paris.\n\nBut Trump vowed to undo the previous administration\u2019s work on climate change. He announced soon after taking office that he would seek to restart the pipeline project, a clear signal that he would move aggressively to promote oil development.\n\nThe pipeline's future, though, remains uncertain. Keystone was conceived at a time of significantly higher oil prices. Its developers had not envisioned prices would drop and remain so low, for so long. Extracting oil from the tar sands is costly, and it remains to be seen if the project will ultimately cost out.\n\nAlready, the White House has retreated from a demand that the builders of the pipeline use American steel -- a vow that Trump announced with considerable fanfare. That requirement would have raised the cost of the project substantially.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Evan Halper", "type": "article"}
