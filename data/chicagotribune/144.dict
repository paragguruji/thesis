Trump attacked over the number of detainees that he said were released during the Obama administration and again took up militancy.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer did something Tuesday he doesn\u2019t often do from the briefing room podium: correct the president.\n\nBut the figure was inaccurate. Of 182 detainees transferred during the Obama administration, just eight were confirmed to have reengaged \u2014 or just over 4%, according to data updated Tuesday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nUnder former President George W. Bush, 113 of the 532 detainees transferred out of Guantanamo, or more than 21%, returned to fighting.\n\n\u201cObviously the president meant in totality the number that had been released,\u201d Spicer said when asked if the White House would correct the president\u2019s comments. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n\nLongstanding White House policy, carried over from the transition period and the campaign before it, was to respond to questions about the president\u2019s social media postings by saying only some variation of, \u201cThe tweet speaks for itself.\u201d\n\n>> 'The tweet speaks for itself' could become a Trump administration motto\n\nAnd while Spicer somewhat timidly acknowledged a misstep, the original tweet posted to Trump\u2019s personal account and a second version posted an hour later to his official White House account remained online and had been retweeted at both accounts more than 22,000 times.\n\nThe origin of Trump's tweet appeared to be a segment on \"Fox & Friends,\" the Fox News morning show that has long been a favorite of the Republican. The segment made no distinction between the number of detainees who had reengaged under the Bush and Obama administrations.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
