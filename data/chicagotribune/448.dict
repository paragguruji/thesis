The original executive order would have expired around now, yet the administration is still pushing to implement the travel ban. The latest setback comes from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 10-3 decision to continue blocking the order.\n\nBut my question is, if these better security measures were supposed to be in place by now, why do we still need a \"temporary\" travel ban?\n\n\u2014 John Houck, Schaumburg", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-26", "authors": "Chicago Tribune", "type": "article"}
