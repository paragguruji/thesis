The next day, President Donald Trump called local officials on the island, issued an emergency declaration and pledged that all federal resources would be directed to help.\n\nBut then for four days after that \u2014 as storm-ravaged Puerto Rico struggled for food and water amid the darkness of power outages \u2014 Trump and his top aides effectively went dark themselves.\n\nTrump jetted to New Jersey that Thursday night to spend a long weekend at his private golf club there, save for a quick trip to Alabama for a political rally. Neither Trump nor any of his senior White House aides said a word publicly about the unfolding crisis.\n\nTrump did hold a meeting at his golf club that Friday with half a dozen Cabinet officials \u2014 including Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, who oversees disaster response - but the gathering was held to discuss his new refugee travel ban, not the hurricane. Duke and Trump spoke briefly about Puerto Rico, but did not talk again until Tuesday, an administration official said.\n\nAdministration officials would not say whether the president spoke with any other top officials involved in the storm response while in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump spent much of his time over those four days fixated on his escalating public feuds with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, with fellow Republicans in Congress and with the NFL over anthem protests.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, meanwhile, the scope of the devastation was becoming clearer. Virtually the entire island was without power and much of it could be for weeks, officials estimated, and about half of the territory's more than 3 million residents were without access to clean water. Gas was in short supply, airports and ports were in disrepair and telecommunications infrastructure had been destroyed.\n\nFederal and local officials said communications on the island made the task of assessing the widespread damage far more challenging, and even local officials were slow to recognize that for this storm, far more help would be necessary.\n\n\"I don't think that anybody realized how bad this was going to be,\" said a person familiar with ongoing discussions between Washington and officials Puerto Rico. \"Quite frankly, the level of communications and collaboration that I've seen with Irma and now Maria between the administration, local government and our office has been unprecedented.\"\n\n\"Whether that's been translated into effectiveness on the ground, that's up for interpretation,\" the person added.\n\nUnlike what they faced in Texas and Florida the federal agencies found themselves partnered with a government completely flattened by the hurricane and operating with almost no information about the status of its citizens. FEMA struggled to find truck drivers to deliver aid from the ports to the people in need, for example.\n\n\"The level of devastation and the impact on the first responders we closely work with was so great that those people were having to take care of their families and homes to an extent we don't normally see,\" said an administration official who insisted on anonymity because he did not want his statement to be interpreted as criticism of authorities in Puerto Rico. \"The Department of Defense, FEMA and the federal government are having to step in to fulfill state and municipal functions that we normally just support.\"\n\nEven though local officials had said publicly as early as Thursday that the island was \"destroyed,\" the sense of urgency didn't begin to penetrate the White House until Monday, when images of the utter destruction and desperation \u2014 and criticism of the administration's response \u2014 began to appear on television, one senior administration official said.\n\nAmid increased warnings of a potential humanitarian crisis in the Caribbean island territory that is home to 3.4 million U.S. citizens, federal relief efforts were ramping up Wednesday, even as criticism mounted. Among the most urgent priorities were food and water deliveries for isolated, storm-pounded rural communities and distribution of diesel for generators to power vital services such as hospital equipment and sanitation systems.\n\n\"The Trump administration was slow off the mark,\" said Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., the first lawmaker of Puerto Rican descent elected by the state of Florida to Congress. \"... We've invaded small countries faster than we've been helping American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\"\n\nTrump's public schedule on Monday was devoid of any meetings related to the storm, but he was becoming frustrated by the coverage he was seeing on TV, the senior official said.\n\nAt a dinner Monday evening with conservative leaders at the White House on Monday, Trump opened the gathering by briefly lamenting the tragedy unfolding in Puerto Rico before launching into a lengthy diatribe against Republican Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., over his opposition to the Republicans' failed health-care bill, according to one attendee.\n\nAfter the dinner, Trump lashed out on social media. He blamed the island's financial woes and ailing infrastructure for the difficult recovery efforts. He also declared that efforts to provide food, water and medical care were \"doing well.\"\n\nOn the ground in Puerto Rico, nothing could be further from the truth. It had taken until Monday \u2014 five days after Maria made landfall \u2014 for the first senior administration officials from Washington to touch down in Puerto Rico to survey the damage firsthand. And only after Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert and FEMA Director Brock Long returned to Washington did the administration leap into action.\n\nTrump presided over a Situation Room meeting on the federal and local efforts on Tuesday and, late in the day, the White House added a Cabinet-level meeting to the president's schedule on Hurricane Maria.\n\nWhite House aides say the president was being updated on progress in the storm recovery efforts through the weekend, and an administration official said Vice President Mike Pence talked with Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n over the weekend. Trump spoke to Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 when Maria made landfall and then again Tuesday; he spoke to Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n for the first time Wednesday.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-29", "authors": "Abby Phillip, Ed O'Keefe, Nick Miroff and Damian Paletta", "type": "article"}
