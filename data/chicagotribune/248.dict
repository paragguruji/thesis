Peter Roskam on Monday said the suburbanites he represents long for \"civility\" in politics, and he blamed President Donald Trump, the recent presidential campaign and social media for the lack of polite and rational discourse.\n\nDuring appearances before the City Club of Chicago and later the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board, the six-term congressman also warned that without the president's engagement toward changing the tax code, efforts to enact tax reform will come to a halt.\n\nRoskam also said the Trump administration's latest travel ban executive order \u2014 including the addition of a time period for implementation \u2014 is an example of how the new president needs to work with his Cabinet and Congress.\n\n\"The 'ready, fire, aim element' of the first travel ban has been recognized that it didn't work and this is an example of the baptism by fire of the Trump administration,\" the congressman said.\n\nA faux memorial service for Rep.

It's a hope. It's speculative. If that's true, then I think his presidency becomes easier and, if it's not, then it becomes rockier,\" said Roskam after the editorial board meeting.\n\nDuring a nearly 50-minute speech at the City Club, Roskam said, \"I think I represent a constituency that is longing for civility in public life. I mean, longing for it,\" he said. \"They don't want to hear judgments. They want to hear solutions and that's how I've tried to present myself.\"\n\nLater, Roskam said he viewed lack of civility in politics an outgrowth of \"one of the toughest (presidential) campaigns that we've seen in a long time,\" one that left Trump with low approval ratings entering office and likely would have done the same to Democrat Hillary Clinton if she had won. Roskam also said part of the reason \"it seems particularly ungracious right now\" is due to social media.\n\nStill, Roskam said, Trump has made a series of \"missteps and foibles\" and is \"the commander in chief and he's the leader and he's got the capacity to set a different tone.\"\n\nRoskam also alluded to Trump's use of Twitter as giving him a better appreciation for the \"unexpressed thought.\"\n\nSpeaking on a wide range of subjects during both appearances, Roskam said there was a \"national inflection point\" on enacting comprehensive tax reform, including simplifying the tax code and working to help encourage business growth.\n\nRoskam, the tax policy chairman on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, called the current tax code an \"island disappearing\" beneath the public and said taxpayers should \"jump (on tax reform) while there's an opportunity to jump.\"\n\nLater, Roskam said Trump's engagement on tax changes was essential, including a controversial provision backed by some House Republicans to enact a border tax adjustment to help encourage domestic manufacturing over imports.\n\n\"But if the president chooses not to engage, I think that's where it stops. If the president engages, then I think the dynamic shifts and, if he works the Senate significantly, then that could be one of his signature accomplishments,\" Roskam said.\n\nRoskam also said that in repealing Obamacare, there should be a \"type of transition that makes sense\" to the program Republicans are proposing, particularly in states like Illinois that have increased health care coverage through federally paid for expansion of Medicaid.\n\nPhil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Protesters gather outside Maggiano's Banquets on March 6, 2017, where Rep.

But he also said merely tinkering with Obamacare would be \"insincere\" since it was a promise Republicans made to voters.\n\nAcross the street from the City Club, about 50 protesters waved signs and shouted chants, including, \"Where's Peter? What do we want? A town hall. When do we want it? Now.\"\n\nRoskam told the nearly 300 people who attended his speech that the idea that he has a lack of accountability to his constituents was a \"false narrative,\" and said as an alternative to a public meeting he recently held a telephone town hall that involved 18,000 people. Critics have contended telephone town halls are more controlled than a public meeting.\n\n\"The House of Representatives is actually the entity in the United States Congress that is the flattest and easiest to get to,\" he said, likening event town halls to \"participating in big circuses and other things.\"\n\n\"I didn't run for office to be a ringleader of that kind of circus. I'm interested in trying to get solutions,\" he later told the editorial board, adding he was holding another telephone town hall on Tuesday.\n\nrap30@aol.com\n\nTwitter @rap30", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Rick Pearson", "type": "article"}
