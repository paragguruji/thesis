S.C.\"\n\n\"S.C.\" may refer to the Supreme Court, where Trump has vowed to take his travel ban fight.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday refused to reinstate Trump's executive order banning travelers from six mostly Muslim countries. A three-judge panel said the administration failed to show that blocking citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was needed to protect the U.S. The court also found that the president's order ran afoul of an immigration law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Circuit also has called Trump's national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was \"steeped in animus and directed at a single religious group.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to immediately reinstate its ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries, saying the U.S. will be safer if the policy is put in place.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-13", "authors": "Associated Press", "type": "article"}
