Entry to the U.S. by people with passports from Libya, Sudan, Syria, Somali, Iran, Iraq and Yemen is also suspended for 90 days. Late Sunday afternoon, the ban was modified to exclude green card holders.\n\nSeveral of the companies said some of their employees would be affected by the ban.\n\nHere is what CEOs have said about the order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nMuhtar Kent, chief executive of the beverage giant, condemned the ban in a statement Monday and pledged support to any affected employees.\n\n\u201cWe do not support this travel ban or any policy that is contrary to our core values and beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a U.S. company that has operations in more than 200 countries and territories, we respect people from all backgrounds and greatly value the diversity of our global system\u2019s more than 700,000 associates.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\nReed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, warned in a Facebook post that these actions could \u201cmake America less safe\u201d through \u201chatred and loss of allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world and are so un-American it pains us all,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEtsy\n\nThe online shopping marketplace\u2019s chief executive, Chad Dickerson, tweeted his opposition to the travel ban Saturday.\n\nIn a letter to employees Monday, American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said the order places \u201cdifficult operating conditions\u201d on some employees.\n\n\u201cReservations agents and airport teams have witnessed turmoil in our airports that shows how divisive this order can be,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, it is the current law of the U.S., and so long as that is the case, we must comply. We are doing everything we can to care for any affected customers and team members and treat them with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nStarbucks\n\nHoward Schultz, the Seattle coffee company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement Sunday that Starbucks is developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLyft\n\nLogan Green, chief executive of the San Francisco ride-hailing firm, announced Sunday that Lyft would donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years. The ACLU filed suit Saturday against the executive order on behalf of two Iraqis, and a federal judge in New York halted deportations for those who had already arrived at U.S. airports.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai was perhaps the first tech executive to speak out against Trump\u2019s travel ban. In a memo to employees Friday night, Pichai said more than 100 company staff members were affected by the order, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n\"It\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" Pichai wrote, according to Bloomberg. \"We\u2019ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\"\n\nOn Monday, Google said it had created a fund that could raise up to $4 million to support the ACLU and three other immigrant rights organizations.\n\nFord\n\nFord Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford and Chief Executive Mark Fields also slammed Trump\u2019s travel ban in a message to employees Monday. The automaker said it was currently not aware of any employees directly affected by the order.\n\n\u201cRespect for all people is a core value of Ford Motor Company, and we are proud of the rich diversity of our company here at home and around the world,\u201d the executives wrote in the memo. \u201cThat is why we do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company.\u201d\n\nShort-term home rental website Airbnb said Saturday that it would offer free housing to refugees and others who have been affected by the travel ban.\n\nTesla/SpaceX\n\nElon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc. and SpaceX, had initially faced criticism from supporters for backing secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, who was CEO of Exxon Mobil, and joining Trump\u2019s advisory panel on business issues. On Sunday, he asked Twitter followers for \u201cspecific amendments\u201d to Trump\u2019s executive order. Musk said he would \u201cseek advisory council consensus\u201d and present those thoughts to Trump. Over the weekend, Musk spoke out against the executive order.\n\nFacebook\n\nIn a Facebook note Friday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the impact of recent executive orders signed by Trump.\n\nHis note dipped into his and his wife\u2019s personal histories \u2014 Zuckerberg said his great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland, while wife Priscilla Chan\u2019s parents were refugees from China and Vietnam.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Samantha Masunaga", "type": "article"}
