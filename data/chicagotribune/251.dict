Those challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional and motivated by Trump's desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump's comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case. The Justice Department argues that the executive order is well within the president's power, and that lower courts have been wrong to second-guess him on a matter of national security.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Michigan ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other advisers \u2014 whose comments judges nationwide have pointed to as they have ordered to freeze the ban. That case is separate from the two that have put Trump's latest ban on hold.\n\nU.S. district judges in Hawaii and Maryland have ordered key sections of the president's order frozen, and to fully reinstate the measure, the Justice Department would have to win in both the 4th and 9th circuits \u2014 or escalate the dispute to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe three judges considering the matter in the 9th Circuit \u2014 Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez \u2014 were appointed by President Bill Clinton. The 4th Circuit heard the case with all its judges, a step the 9th Circuit declined to take.\n\nTrump has not been shy about criticizing judges who rule against him, but he seems to have particular ire for the 9th Circuit. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter, \"First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\" Orrick is a lower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump then wrote that the circuit had a \"terrible record of being overturned\" \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \"absolutely\" considered breaking up the court.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-14", "authors": "Matt Zapotosky", "type": "article"}
