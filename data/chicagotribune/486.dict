The Trump administration is now appealing to reinstate the travel ban.\n\nOn Sunday, a judge in San Francisco rejected the government's request for an immediate reinstatement. Formal arguments in the case begin Monday.\n\nRegardless of tensions between their governments, American and Iranian wrestlers have frequently hosted each other in competitions and have a working relationship that goes back decades.\n\nAt least one Iranian parliamentarian, Ali Mohtari, was critical of the original decision to ban the U.S. team. In a posting on Twitter, Mohtari argued that Iran should do the opposite of Trump and instead make a point of welcoming the American wrestlers.\n\nZach Rey, a former wrestling champion at Lehigh University, expressed disappointment Friday after Iran banned U.S. wrestlers from competing there in response to Trump's executive order.\n\nOn Sunday, Rey said a phone conference was planned for later in the day to discuss whether the team would still be going. He did not immediately respond to a phone call Sunday evening requesting an update.\n\nMorning Call staff contributed.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": "The Associated Press", "type": "article"}
