Its main competitor Lyft then leapfrogged into 1st place in terms of downloads, becoming one of the most popular apps in the country. This followed Uber CEO Travis Kalanick tweeting that the travel ban is \u201cagainst everything Uber stands for\u201d while vowing to \u201cuse his position\u201d on a Trump advisory council to \u201cstand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d In the view of many of Uber\u2019s tech-savvy, urban customers, that was not enough.\n\nSay what you will about corporate social responsibility, it\u2019s not necessarily smart for a chief executive to make a political stand. A company\u2019s primary responsibility is to its shareholders, so protesting the actions of a president \u2014 especially a thin-skinned one like Trump, who likes to meddle in corporations\u2019 business decisions \u2014 may be counterproductive.\n\nEssentially, U.S. businesses now face the same dilemma Russian companies faced when President Vladimir Putin began increasing the government\u2019s role in the economy and rolling back civil liberties. Everyone who went publicly against the autocratic flow was squeezed out of business in Russia. The cases of media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky, oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, retail whiz Yevgeny Chichvarkin are commonly known examples. Other Russian capitalists, who grew rich in the freer era before Putin, decided against tempting fate and toed the party line.\n\nFor many U.S. tech executives, the choice is more complicated. Russia\u2019s general public was never particularly politicized, so it easily accepted Putin\u2019s contract \u2014 relative prosperity and security in exchange for less freedom. Many U.S. tech companies prize the same urban, educated clientele who backed Hillary Clinton and strongly oppose Trump.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Twitter, and Netflix decided to stand with these customers \u2014 and with many of their employees. Companies outside Silicon Valley, however, didn\u2019t jump on the bandwagon. There was no angry statement from McDonald\u2019s or Walmart, which employ plenty of Muslims. Their management clearly saw no benefit in sticking its neck out on a matter as incendiary as Trump\u2019s border policy.\n\nNo one is boycotting them.\n\nIn a 2013 paper on anticipating, preventing and surviving secondary boycotts \u2014 those in which a firm is punished for action that didn\u2019t directly damage the protesters \u2014 Judith Schrempf and her collaborators from the University of Richmond suggested that a company\u2019s managers keep a list of issues that might cause a boycott and attempt to work out where the company should stand on those issues. Clearly, the Trump agenda is full of boycott-inducing issues, and a conscientious executive ought to go through the list and make some preemptive decisions. Kalanick\u2019s mistake was not identifying Trump\u2019s entry ban and the drivers\u2019 strike as a business-critical issue early enough.\n\nBut perhaps making strong statements concerning Trump\u2019s divisive policies to stop the boycott is also a mistake \u2014 a Russian entrepreneur would immediately see why.\n\nWhile boycotts are perhaps easier to organize than they used to be, what with social network pressure and the ease of deleting an app from a phone, the storm will likely blow over. On the other hand, voicing opposition to Trump could provoke lasting damage.\n\nTake Microsoft, which has come out strongly against Trump\u2019s entry ban by aiding a lawsuit to overturn it filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general. It has just sold $17 billion worth of bonds to pay dividends and repurchase shares \u2014 despite sitting on $123 billion in cash. Almost all of it sits in Microsoft\u2019s foreign subsidiaries to avoid paying U.S. taxes upon repatriation. Trump could move to force Microsoft, Apple and other tech companies to repatriate offshore cash on unfavorable terms, probably with broad public support behind him. The president could also wage war on the likes of Uber and Lyft, making them comply with labor market and taxi licensing laws. The same taxi drivers who rallied against his immigration policy would cheer him on.\n\nThat the tech firms are unafraid of inviting retribution shows they\u2019ve lived in a permissive political climate for too long. If Trump is at all like Russian President Putin, he will counterattack and the firms will either bend to his will \u2014 as most did in Russia \u2014 or face serious costs. Then, the majority of big U.S. companies that decided against making loud political statements will quietly congratulate themselves on their\n\nBloomberg\n\nLeonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.
