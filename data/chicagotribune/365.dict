{"title": "As Trump lashes out, Republicans grow uneasy", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-republicans-20170605-story.html", "text": "President Donald Trump, after days of lashing out angrily at the London mayor and federal courts in the wake of the London Bridge terrorist attack, faces a convergence of challenges this week that threatens to exacerbate the fury that has gripped him - and which could further hobble a Republican agenda that has slowed to a crawl on Capitol Hill.\n\nInstead of bunkering down and delicately navigating the legal and political thicket - as some White House aides have suggested - Trump spent much of Monday launching volleys on Twitter, unable to resist continuing, in effect, as his own lawyer, spokesman, cheerleader and media watchdog.\n\nTrump escalated his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, incorrectly stating that Khan had told Londoners to not be \"alarmed\" about terrorism. He vented about the Justice Department, which he said pushed a \"politically correct\" version of his policy to block immigration from six predominantly Muslim countries, which Trump signed before it was halted in court. He also complained that Senate Democrats are \"taking forever to approve\" his appointees and ambassadors.\n\nInside the White House, top officials have in various ways gently suggested to Trump over the past week that he should leave the feuding to surrogates, according to two people who were not authorized to speak publicly. But Trump has repeatedly shrugged off that advice, these people said.\n\n\"Not that I'm aware of,\" White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday at a news conference when asked if the president's tweets were being vetted by lawyers or aides.\n\n\"Social media for the president is extremely important,\" Sanders said. \"It gives him the ability to speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those types of communication.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to disengage from the daily storm of news - coming ahead of former FBI Director James Comey's highly anticipated public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday - is both unsurprising and unsettling to many Republicans, who are already skittish about the questions they may confront in the aftermath of the hearing. In particular, they foresee Democratic accusations that Trump's exchanges with Comey about the FBI probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign were an effort to obstruct justice.\n\nSome Republicans fear Trump's reactions will only worsen the potential damage.\n\n\"It's a distraction and he needs to focus,\" said former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett. \"Every day and moment he spends on anything other than a rising economy is a waste that disrupts everything.\"\n\nRick Tyler, a veteran Republican consultant, said Trump's refusal to stop using Twitter poses a serious obstacle for the White House.\n\n\"I can't imagine internally they're happy with his performance,\" Tyler said. \"The president is undermining his presidency, whenever his staff says one thing and then he does another. They'll say something you'd expect and then he'll go off and bring in the gun debate to a terror attack.\"\n\nSome Trump supporters also fear that his extemporaneous rebukes are upending the priorities he is trying to implement.\n\nGeorge Conway, a well-known GOP lawyer who recently took himself out of the running to lead the Justice Department's Civil Division and is the husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter on Monday that Trump's fulminations on the travel ban could damage its chances.\n\n\"These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,\" he wrote, using abbreviations for Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's friends say he's just being himself.\n\n\"He's rightly frustrated and he isn't always checking with his lawyers about each tweet. But he's getting his message out there,\" said Christopher Ruddy, a close associate of Trump and president of Newsmax Media, a conservative news organization. \"He is relying on himself to be the messenger.\"\n\nIt is an increasingly lonely endeavor. Trump's poll numbers have sagged, with Gallup's daily tracking number showing him at 37 percent approval on Monday, nearing the nadir of his presidency so far, while the RealClearPolitics polling average shows his approval rating just under 40 percent.\n\nYet even among party leadership and senior advisers in the West Wing, many remain supportive of Trump's combative posture, unable or unwilling to usher him toward a less incendiary approach.\n\n\"It's all infighting and leaks to the point where Trump is diluting his own proposals,\" Bennett said. \"I don't get it. Rather than getting him to talk about jobs, they stand by as he goes on about Mayor Khan.\"\n\nThe few who have spoken up have been careful to not provoke Trump. \"Unfortunately the president has, I think, created problems for himself by his Twitter habit,\" Sen. John Cornyn, Texas, the No. 2-ranking Senate Republican, said with a tight smile during a Sunday interview on Dallas TV station WFAA.\n\nComey's testimony is one of a number of items on the White House radar this week that risk stoking Trump's rage.\n\nA week after Trump declared his trip to the Middle East a success, the region was swept into turmoil Monday after four Arab nations - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain - broke diplomatic relations with another U.S. ally, Qatar, which they have accused of supporting terrorism.\n\nSeveral U.S. allies in Europe also have grown weary with Trump after he decided to withdraw the country last week from the Paris climate accord. One of his closer allies there, British Prime Minister Theresa May, responded uncomfortably Monday to Trump's outbursts about Khan, who is Muslim, as the United Kingdom was coping with the aftermath of the London Bridge attack that killed seven.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "Robert Costa", "type": "article"}
