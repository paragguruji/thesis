He talked animatedly with French President Emmanuel Macron while watching French and American troops, armored personnel carriers, tanks, missile launchers and other military equipment parade for more than two hours from the Arc de Triomphe down the grand avenue.\n\nDozens of military planes and helicopters thundered over the heads of the two presidents, with one formation of fighter jets painting the sky with streaks of red, white and blue smoke signifying the tricolors of both nations.\n\nThe newly elected Macron had invited Trump on short notice for France\u2019s national day celebrations and to mark the 100th anniversary of American troops\u2019 arrival in France to help fight German forces in World War I.\n\nBands played traditional French marching music. At one point a marching band spelled out the word \"NICE\" in front of the VIP reviewing stand, in memory of 86 people killed a year earlier by an Islamic extremist driving a cargo truck into a Bastille Day celebration in that French city.\n\n\u201cThe presence today of the U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife is the sign of a friendship that lasts through time,\u201d Macron said at the conclusion of the parade.\n\nFrance has found \u201csure allies, friends who came to help us,\" he said. \"The United States of America are among them. That is why nothing will separate us, never.\u201d\n\nMacron seemed eager to woo Trump personally, and substantively. He focused their meetings Thursday on issues the two administrations can cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and Syria.\n\nMacron did not bring up contentious issues such as Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, Trump\u2019s homeland security advisor, Tom Bossert, told reporters flying with the president back to the U.S.\n\nClimate issues \u201cdidn\u2019t chill or infect or in any way come up verbally or through nonverbal cues in our conversations,\u201d Bossert said.\n\nBy the afternoon on Friday, Trump was stepping off Air Force One into the rain, opening a large black umbrella to keep drops off himself and First Lady Melania Trump as they walked to the motorcade taking the couple to Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend. He planned to attend the U.S. Women\u2019s Open golf tournament being held there.\n\nThe last time the president had a rainy weekend in Bedminster he watched television news, fumed, and by his own later account decided to fire FBI Director James B. Comey because of Comey\u2019s pursuit of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe weather forecast this weekend called for the clouds to part Saturday and the sun to be out all weekend.\n\nTrump did find an adoring crowd in Bedminster. Spectators broke the hushed quiet at the golf tournament when Trump came to the windows of a viewing area multiple times to wave to the crowd near the course\u2019s 15th hole.\n\nTournament organizers encouraged the crowd to keep their voices down for golfers playing through the drizzle on a nearby green.\n\nTwitter: @ByBrianBennett\n\nbrian.bennett@latimes.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-14", "authors": "Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
