Pick one side of a hot-button issue, the thinking goes, and you'll risk losing customers on the other side.\n\nBut like so many norms before it, President Trump has turned this one on its head.\n\nA growing number of companies are deciding it's a bigger risk to their investors and bottom line to stay quiet than it is to protest Trump's ban on refugees and travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, betting vocal opposition to the executive order scores them a moral and fiscal victory.\n\nWhile it was possible for companies to take a wait-and-see approach leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, many firms can no longer ignore the White House\u2019s policy given the effect the order is already having on employees either stranded or fearful of traveling.\n\nOnly a week ago it seemed foolish to speak out against a president who has admonished individual companies on social media such as Carrier, Boeing and General Motors. Now the pendulum has swung the other way. Companies, mostly in technology but increasingly in other sectors, have decided that it\u2019s not enough just to speak out against the immigration order. They believe that they must also take headline-grabbing action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d said Michael Gordon, chief executive of Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis public relations firm in New York. \u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see is the polarization of our politics is now leading to partisanship in everything, even bland topics like transportation, shoes and coffee.\u201d\n\nOne of the first shots came Friday when Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai wrote a memo slamming Trump\u2019s executive order and urging employees overseas to return to the U.S. The search engine giant also revealed it was raising $4 million in donations for organizations defending immigrants\u2019 rights.\n\nIn a letter to employees Sunday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said the \u201cconscience of our country\u201d was being questioned as a result of Trump\u2019s executive order and said he planned to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years across the globe.\n\nAnd on Monday, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Mark Fields criticized the refugee ban, saying in a statement: \u201cWe do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company.\u201d\n\nOther executives who have spoken out against the White House include Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings and, to some astonishment, Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, who told employees over voicemail the executive order was at odds with the company\u2019s diversity practices.\n\nHigh-profile companies that are seen siding with Trump or that fail to give anything short of a full-throttled rebuke of the executive order risk a backlash.\n\nUber was already in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s critics when its founder, Travis Kalanick, agreed to sit on the president\u2019s economic advisory panel. Despite issuing a statement criticizing the order on Saturday afternoon, the bad PR metastasized that evening into a boycott, with the hashtag #DeleteUber trending after the ride-hailing giant publicized its continued operations at Kennedy International Airport in New York following a taxi strike protesting the immigration order.\n\nUber\u2019s chief rival, Lyft, pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union and saw its downloads surpass Uber\u2019s on Apple\u2019s iOS for the first time ever on Sunday, according to App Annie.\n\nElon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors, has also faced no shortage of criticism for his presence on Trump\u2019s economic advisory panel, and more recently, his support of Rex Tillerson for secretary of State. On Sunday, Musk asked his nearly 7 million Twitter followers for ideas on how to improve Trump\u2019s immigration order. Predictably, that too was met with criticism that the order was fundamentally flawed and unfixable.\n\nA day earlier, Twitter tweeted from its main account that it stood by immigrants. Rather than praise, it was met with a sizable number of calls to kick Trump off the platform.\n\nTo be sure, there are many companies that are eager about a Trump presidency, most notably in the banking and energy sectors, where deregulation is expected.\n\nBut the manner in which the White House is introducing policy is sowing uncertainty and geopolitical risk that\u2019s worrying American businesses on the global market. The Dow Jones\u2019 122.65 point decline Monday \u2014 its biggest since October \u2014 seemed to reflect that unease, one that could conceivably grow if the White House continues to shun norms and lash out at its biggest trading partners.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s role in the world is more tenuous,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm. \u201cSo some companies are incredibly nervous. But what we\u2019re seeing today will be nothing compared to what happens if the U.S.-China relationship gets ugly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to protest issues that could affect their bottom line. Sometimes they\u2019re heated political issues such as North Carolina\u2019s bathroom bill, which resulted in a boycott of the state last year by companies that consider the law discriminatory against transgender people.\n\nSometimes companies respond to protest movements, such as when Coca-Cola left South Africa to oppose apartheid. But rarely have these moves by businesses been aimed at the federal government, and when they are, they haven\u2019t included such a mix of companies from different industries.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "David Pierson", "type": "article"}
