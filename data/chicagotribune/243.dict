He's the epitome of why these visas exist, to encourage people from foreign countries to come here and study and learn,\" Durkin told the Tribune. \"This is a terrible humanitarian tragedy, and I can't believe that he's the only one suffering like this.\"\n\nThe suit marked the second legal action taken in Chicago's federal court since Monday over Trump's controversial order. On Monday, a Chicago man who traveled to his native Iran to care for his ailing mother asked a federal judge to declare the order unconstitutional.\n\nThe plaintiff, who filed under the pseudonym John Doe, is an Iranian citizen and legal permanent resident of the U.S. who lives in Chicago with his wife and three children. According to the suit, the man was planning to return to Chicago early this month in time for the birth of his first grandchild, but when he tried to get a return flight Saturday, the ticketing agency \"refused to issue a ticket for his travel to the United States due to the executive order.\"\n\nCourt records A redacted image of Dr. Amer Al Homssi's visa shows it was canceled after he traveled to United Arab Emirates.

(Court records) (Court records)\n\nDoe's lawyer, Taher Kameli, said Tuesday that his client is \"anxious\" to get home to see his family but afraid to try to re-enter the U.S. with reports of immigration agents detaining travelers for hours of questioning even if they have permanent residency or green cards.\n\n\"He's afraid to come back, things are changing so quickly,\" said Kameli, who said his client wished to remain anonymous in case there were further efforts to impede his travel. \"He's basically stopped in a very bad situation.\"\n\nHearings in both lawsuits were scheduled for Wednesday in separate courtrooms at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse.\n\nThe two Chicago lawsuits come on the heels of a tumultuous weekend at O'Hare International Airport, where people traveling from seven majority-Muslim countries were detained for hours as customs agents struggled over how to interpret the president's order.\n\nAl Homssi has been a resident through the University of Illinois at Chicago since August. He has an apartment near the hospital in Oak Lawn and possessed two types of travel visas \u2014 one issued to those enrolled in educational opportunities and another more general travel visa, according to the suit.\n\nOn Jan. 18, Al Homssi flew back to UAE \u2014 where his father is a pathologist \u2014 to be married. On Sunday, five days after the wedding, his father had dropped him off at the airport in Dubai for his flight back to Chicago when a U.S. immigration officer seized his passport and boarding pass and ordered him to a secondary screening area, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter Al Homssi handed over his cellphone, answered a series of questions and had his luggage searched, he was told he was being refused entry into the U.S. because of the executive order, the suit alleged. The immigration officials then handed his visa documents back to him with a line drawn through them in black marker.\n\nOn the visas were handwritten notations in blue reading, \"Cancelled E.O. 59447v.8,\" a reference to the executive order. Photos of the allegedly canceled visas were filed with the lawsuit.\n\nAl Homssi was then told by officers at the airport that \"it might be 90 days or longer\" before he could expect to board a flight back to the U.S., according to the suit. The development could force him to drop out of the residency program at the hospital, where he was expected to resume duties Wednesday, the suit alleged.\n\nIf he were to lose his residency at the hospital, Al Homssi could be kicked out of UAE and forced to return to Syria, according to the suit.\n\n\"All of these dreadful consequences ... are the result of his being a member of the Muslim faith that is now being treated differently in the United States in stark violation of the First Amendment\" guarantees of freedom of religion, the lawsuit alleged. Like other suits filed in different districts, Al Homssi is seeking an injunction stopping enforcement of the order nationwide.\n\nIn a letter dated Tuesday and included in the court filing, Al Homssi's supervisor at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Dr. Armand Krikorian, wrote that Al Homssi has been \"excellent at all levels\" and that his \"timely presence is critically needed.\"\n\nThe White House has argued that the executive order is not a Muslim ban and that it prohibits all people from seven countries \u2014 Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Jordan and Somalia \u2014 that have an established terrorist network. Press secretary Sean Spicer shrugged off legal challenges during the White House briefing Monday, telling reporters he feels \"pretty confident that if there's any problems, we'll prevail.\"\n\n\"This is a national security issue,\" he said.\n\nBut Durkin wrote in the lawsuit it was \"unmistakably clear\" that the executive order targets Muslims, in part because of a clause that appears to protect Christians seeking to emigrate from the seven countries. U.S. customs officials were also interested in an app on Al Homssi's cellphone called \"Islamona,\" a popular program featuring Quran prayer and scripture, he said.\n\nAl Homssi has no criminal record, and the customs officials asked him no questions related to terrorism, according to the suit.\n\nKameli, meanwhile, said the order has unlawfully affected people like his client, who moved his family to Chicago five years ago to give his children a better future and has legal standing in the U.S. Now he's worried he'll miss the birth of his grandchild, due Feb. 25.\n\n\"It's chaos out there. From airport to airport, things are different,\" Kameli said.\n\nTribune news services contributed.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Jason Meisner", "type": "article"}
