The state asked Watson, who blocked the president's revised travel ban in March, to clarify that those family members are also exempt from the ban.\n\nWatson rejected Hawaii's request, saying the state should go to the U.S. Supreme Court since it was seeking to clarify that court's requirement of a \"bona fide relationship.\"\n\nHawaii appealed Watson's ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court said Watson's ruling was not appealable under federal judicial laws. The 9th Circuit, however, said Watson had the authority to interpret the Supreme Court's order and block any violation of it. Hawaii then renewed its last week request with Watson in a different form.\n\n\"Because plaintiffs now seek such injunctive relief, the court reaches the merits of their request, consistent with the Ninth Circuit's guidance,\" Watson wrote.\n\nThe Hawaii attorney general's office didn't immediately comment on Watson's ruling.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment Thursday.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-14", "authors": "Jennifer Sinco Kelleher", "type": "article"}
