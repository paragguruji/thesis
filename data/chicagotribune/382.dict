The judges will decide whether to uphold a Hawaii judge's decision in March that blocked the ban.\n\nDozens of advocates for refugees and immigrants rallied outside the federal courthouse in Seattle, some carrying \"No Ban, No Wall\" signs.\n\nLast week, judges on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments over whether to affirm a Maryland judge's decision putting the ban on ice. They also questioned whether they could consider Trump's campaign statements, with one judge asking if there was anything other than \"willful blindness\" that would prevent them from doing so.\n\nTed S.

(Caleb Jones / AP) (Caleb Jones / AP)\n\n\"Again, in this court, the President claims a nearly limitless power to make immigration policy that is all but immune from judicial review,\" Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin wrote to the 9th Circuit. \"Again, he must be checked.\"\n\nThe administration's lawyers are seeking to persuade the judges that the lower court's decision is \"fundamentally wrong,\" and that the president's order falls squarely within his duty to secure the nation's borders. The order as written is silent on religion, and neither Hawaii nor its co-plaintiff, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, has standing to sue, they say \u2014 arguments that were rejected in the lower court.\n\nThe travel ban cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court, but that would likely be cemented if the 4th and 9th Circuits reach differing conclusions about its legality. Because of how the courts chose to proceed, a full slate of 13 judges heard the 4th Circuit arguments last week, while just three, all appointees of President Bill Clinton, will sit in Seattle.\n\nFor that reason \u2014 with the possibility for myriad concurring or dissenting opinions \u2014 it could take the 4th Circuit longer to rule, noted Carl Tobias, a law professor at University of Richmond law school in Virginia.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Martha Bellisle contributed to this report.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "authors": "Gene Johnson", "type": "article"}
