See you in the Supreme Court!\" Trump wrote.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick \u2014 who imposed a temporary nationwide injunction against Trump's Jan. 25 order \u2014 does not serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, though those judges would review his decisions.\n\nIn an earlier statement, the White House took aim at Orrick, saying his ruling \"unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation.\"\n\n\"This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,\" the White House statement said.\n\nOrrick pointed to discrepancies in the administration's interpretation of the executive order, which broadly authorized the attorney general to withhold grant money from jurisdictions that do not cooperate with immigration officials on deportations and other enforcement actions.\n\nCarolyn Kaster / AP President Donald Trump speaks at the Interior Department in Washington on April 26, 2017, before signing an Antiquities Executive Order.

The department responded to the ruling by saying it could essentially continue to operate as it had been.\n\nThe judge's decision largely blocks the administration from doing things its lawyers said in court the agency would not do, such as strip health-care funding from cities and towns.\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups said the injunction offered a clear warning that Trump's order \u2014 the third issued by the president to be blocked, at least partially, in federal court \u2014 is illegal.\n\n\"Once again, the courts have spoken to defend tolerance, diversity and inclusion from the illegal threats of the Trump administration,\" ACLU National Political Director Faiz Shakir said in a statement. \"Once again, Trump has overreached and lost.\"\n\nIn court, the government's lawyers suggested cities and towns were overreacting to the order because federal officials have not yet defined sanctuary cities or moved to withhold funding from them. But on television and in news conferences, the judge pointed out, the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have threatened to sanction such jurisdictions.\n\n\"The result of this schizophrenic approach to the Order is that the Counties' worst fears are not allayed and the Counties reasonably fear enforcement under the Order,\" the judge wrote. \"The threat of the Order and the uncertainty it is causing impermissibly interferes with the Counties' ability to operate, to provide key services, to plan for the future, and to budget.\"\n\nTrump says sanctuary cities put Americans at risk by refusing to hold immigrants who have been arrested or convicted of serious crimes until immigration agents can take them into custody and deport them.\n\nSanctuary cities' officials counter that they do not have the legal authority to hold a person after a judge in a criminal case has ordered that person released. Holding people on immigration offenses is generally a civil process, rather than a criminal one.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Justice Department lawyers are reviewing legal options. \"It's the 9th Circuit going bananas,\" he told reporters Tuesday evening. \"The idea that an agency can't put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is going to be overturned eventually, and we'll win at the Supreme Court level at some point.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-26", "authors": "Maria Sacchetti", "type": "article"}
