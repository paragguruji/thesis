You are blaming President Donald Trump instead of the liberal activist judges in Hawaii and Maryland who violated the law and the Constitution of the United States when giving their judgment on President Trump's temporary travel ban from six predominantly Muslim Middle Eastern countries. The law and the Constitution give the President of the United States the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be in the national interest of the United States. The commander-in-chief has the fundamental right to determine who comes in our country as a matter of national security.\n\nThis law is crystal clear, yet these liberal activist judges in Hawaii and Maryland are basing their decisions on their own personal opinions about what President Trump said in his heated presidential campaign on banning Muslims from Middle Eastern countries that are hell bent on harming the citizens of the United States. These liberal activist judges should only look at the four corners of the executive order, the laws Congress passed in this regard and the Constitution of the United States. The way these liberal activist judges acted in President Trump's travel ban ruling, they have made themselves dictators.\n\nBharat Agrawal, Mt.
