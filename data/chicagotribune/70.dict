Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth.\u201d\n\nHe also took a carefully veiled swipe at Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Muslim countries that, at least in the past, turned a blind eye to radical clerics and others who raised money or recruited for extremist groups.\n\n\u201cThere can be no coexistence with this violence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it.\u201d\n\nHe said America seeks \u201cpartners, not perfection\u201d to pursue peace and security in the region. Invoking God eight separate times, the president also preached the virtues of religious tolerance for followers of all faiths.\n\nTrump\u2019s aides had portrayed the speech as a rebuttal in some ways to President Obama\u2019s attempts to open bridges to the Islamic world in a famous speech in Cairo in June 2009.\n\nIn that speech, Obama called for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in U.S. relations with Muslim nations. Noting that he was raised in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama said he felt the need to fight \"negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric Sunday was chiefly notable for its stunning contrast with his regular demonization of Muslims on the campaign trail last year.\n\nBack then, he repeatedly warned \u201cIslam hates us\u201d and called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d As president, he has issued two orders seeking to bar most travel from select Muslim-majority nations; federal judges have blocked both because of what they say appears to be an anti-Muslim motivation.\n\nTrump ended his comments with a harsh denunciation of Iran, a common enemy for most of the Sunni Arab leaders, who listened to his remarks through translation devices.\n\nHe did not acknowledge Iran\u2019s peaceful election Friday, which rejected a hard-line Shiite cleric and returned reformist President Hassan Rouhani to office in a landslide. In contrast, most of the Gulf Arab states are monarchies, and few Arab nations hold regular elections.\n\n\u201cUntil the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve,\u201d Trump said.\n\nA senior White House official told reporters later that \"an emboldened Iran has united the Arab world in a very unique way.\"\n\n\"They are working together extremely cooperatively, and also frankly, cooperating incredibly well with Israel,\" the official said. Trump will arrive in Israel on Monday morning, his second stop on his trip.\n\nHis remarks Sunday to an Arab-Islamic-American summit hosted by the Saudi king were the capstone of a dizzying second day of an eight-day marathon to the Middle East and Europe.\n\nAfter an elaborate welcome fit for a king on Saturday, he began Sunday with a succession of one-on-one meetings with kings, presidents and emirs from the Gulf region before turning to the two broader gatherings of regional leaders.\n\nAhead of a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its six member nations and the U.S. outlined new commitments to move against terrorist financing.\n\nLater Sunday, Trump helped Saudi King Salman open a new center for monitoring and combating global terrorism.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech was drafted by Stephen Miller, a White House senior policy advisor who had helped write Trump\u2019s now-stalled travel ban. The speech later was revised with input from Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his national security advisor, H.R. McMaster.\n\nDuring the campaign last year, Trump attacked Obama for refusing to describe terrorist threats as \u201cradical Islamic extremism.\u201d Obama and his defenders said the term would anger Muslim nations and feed terrorism propaganda that claims America is at war with Islam.\n\nIn his speech Sunday, Trump misstated the term twice. An aide said later the president garbled the language because he was \"just an exhausted guy.\"\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem to matter. At least outwardly, key regional leaders were eager to praise Trump for his leadership and in several cases invite him to visit their countries.\n\nThe emir of Kuwait called the president \u201cBrother Trump,\u201d and said he hoped to welcome him one day to the tiny country that a U.S.-led coalition liberated from Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi likewise expressed hope that Trump would visit his country \u2014 an invitation Trump seemed more eager to accept \u2014 while praising the president as \u201ca unique personality who is capable of the impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nMeeting with the emir of Qatar, Trump said they would discuss \u201cthe purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment, because nobody makes it like the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cBravo President Trump,\u201d tweeted Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 foreign minister, who said the speech defined an \u201capproach toward extremism and terrorism with candid respect and friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s role reaffirmed,\u201d he wrote in another tweet.\n\nBut many Muslims, especially those outside the Gulf states, were less enthusiastic.\n\nThe Palestinian group Hamas, which holds sway over the Gaza Strip, condemned Trump\u2019s words as a \u201cslander against the reputation of the resistance of the [Palestinian] people.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Trump had lumped Hamas along with Islamic State and Al Qaeda as terrorist groups.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-22", "authors": "Michael A.
