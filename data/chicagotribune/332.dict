In addition to falsely claiming that the news media have ignored terrorist attacks \u2014 the White House later said they included the mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, Fla. \u2014 Trump chastised a federal judge in personal terms for halting an immigration and refugee ban from seven mostly Muslim nations. The legal battle over the travel ban could quickly move to the Supreme Court.\n\nSessions \u201cis in a tight spot, that is for sure,\u201d said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. \u201cHe has a tough job for a whole panoply of reasons.\u201d\n\nSessions was first elected to the Senate from Alabama in 1996 and served two decades on the Judiciary Committee, which reviews federal judges and conducts oversight of the Justice Department.\n\nBut in a partisan era, his confirmation hearings quickly broke on party lines. In the end, he did not receive a single vote from Democrats on the committee.\n\nSupporters say Sessions is uniquely qualified to lead the Justice Department in such a turbulent time.\n\nPointing to his 12 years as U.S. attorney in Alabama, and two years as state attorney general, they said Sessions has the experience to prosecute criminals, make policy decisions and aggressively tackle illegal immigration.\n\nThey described him as personable and courteous, traits that led him to be generally well regarded in the Senate, and could help him win over career Justice Department lawyers.\n\n\u201cHe is serious about both the law and the department, and with his background he is uniquely equipped to handle the job,\u201d said Michael B. Mukasey, who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush and who testified in support of Sessions\u2019 nomination. \u201cI suspect the learning curve won\u2019t be too steep for him.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups worry that Sessions\u2019 conservative record on civil rights, voting rights and environmental laws portends trouble.\n\nThey also are concerned that such an ardent Trump advocate \u2014 Sessions was one of Trump\u2019s earliest and most enthusiastic campaign surrogates \u2014 will oversee the reported federal investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies last month issued a report that concluded Russian intelligence agencies launched cyberattacks against Democratic Party officials and took other measures aimed at influencing American voters to support Trump.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and other Democrats have questioned whether Sessions can be trusted to enforce the law, especially if potential investigative targets are in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to reconcile for me the independence and objectivity necessary for the position of attorney general with the partisanship this nominee has demonstrated,\u201d Feinstein said to explain why she voted against Sessions\u2019 nomination in the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSessions has said he won\u2019t be afraid to tell Trump he was wrong or that a planned action is unconstitutional. An attorney general has \u201cto be able to say no, both for the country, for the legal system and for the president, to avoid situations that are not acceptable. I understand that duty,\u201d Sessions testified.\n\nLegal experts and former Justice Department officials said Sessions would have a difficult task. Trump is used to getting his way. He also has expressed expansive views of presidential authority that worry even the most conservative legal scholars.\n\nJohn Yoo, a law professor at UC Berkeley who served in the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration, said Sessions would have to combat those presidential impulses while retaining Trump\u2019s trust \u2014 a task that Yoo likened to walking a tightrope.\n\n\u201cIf you are too far from the president, you will get cut out of the decision-making process and you are not doing your job as attorney general,\u201d said Yoo, who recently wrote in the New York Times that he had concerns about Trump\u2019s use of presidential authority.\n\nWhile in the Justice Department, Yoo was a vocal advocate for a muscular executive branch. He wrote the so-called torture memos that gave the Bush administration the legal authority to approve the CIA\u2019s use of \"enhanced interrogation\" of suspected terrorists, including waterboarding.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Yoo added, \u201csomeone has to tell the president that what he is doing is illegal or unconstitutional, even when Trump\u2019s instincts and his political advisors are pushing for it. Sessions is the only person in the administration now who can do that, tell the president no. We will have to see how that plays out.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Yoo said James B. Comey, the FBI director, has little political capital.\n\nIn July, Comey publicly announced that no charges would be filed against Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton for her email practices as secretary of State, infuriating Republicans. Then, a week before the November election, he announced the FBI was reviewing newly discovered emails, astonishing Democrats.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "Del Quentin Wilber", "type": "article"}
