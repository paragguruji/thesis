We\u2019re going to fight this terrible ruling. We\u2019re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nAs Trump noted, the second ban was tailored to get around the judicial criticisms of the first measure, which was to be rescinded when the second one went into effect.\n\nMore openly than he has before, the president indicated his displeasure at having to concoct the new version at all.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, \u2018Let\u2019s tailor it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Cathleen Decker", "type": "article"}
