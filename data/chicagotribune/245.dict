From the DHS office, protesters marched to Federal Center Plaza.\n\nAmong other speakers was Jane Ramsey, a board member with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. She expressed solidarity with unauthorized immigrants living in Chicago.\n\nMore than 200 protesters gathered Feb. 1, 2017, outside the Department of Homeland Security in Chicago, the latest in a string of demonstrations that have erupted since President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\n\n\"We will not stand for the over-policing of our communities,\" she said into a megaphone. \"We will not stand for the politics of fear, hate, division, scapegoating of immigrants and other minorities.\"\n\nAmanda Wingard-Phillips, 35, said she learned about the protest on Facebook and came out because some of her relatives travel abroad, and she's afraid they may not be allowed entry back into the country if they visit one of the seven countries noted by Trump.\n\n\"I've been trying to support various causes,\" said Wingard-Phillips, a consultant who lives in Wicker Park. \"I marched in the Women's March and have been protesting over at (Sens. Tammy) Duckworth and (Dick) Durbin's office on the (Cabinet) appointments. ... As a rich white lady, I should be using my privilege to stand up and say what's wrong.\"\n\necherney@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @ElyssaCherney", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Elyssa Cherney", "type": "article"}
