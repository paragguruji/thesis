The Justice Department can still withhold grants from places that don't comply with the law, according to U.S. District Judge William Orrick's order, but not \"in a way that violates the Constitution.\"\n\nThe ruling follows others now moving through the courts that have cast serious doubt on Trump's order. In September, for example, federal Judge John Lee of the Northern District of Illinois invalidated the practice of issuing detainers \u2014 formal requests from federal authorities for a local jail to hold noncitizen inmates \u2014 on constitutional grounds.\n\nIf federal authorities want to hold an immigrant in local custody, the judge ruled, they must get a warrant.\n\nThe first complication about sanctuary cities is that there is no legal definition for the term under federal law. To former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and other known conservative influencers of our cable TV-loving president, sanctuary cities are local governments that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities regarding the status of prisoners in their custody.\n\nBut the level of cooperation can vary drastically from one locality to the next. The Justice Department sent warning letters Friday to New York City, Chicago, Cook County, Miami, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Milwaukee and Sacramento, Calif.\n\nThe department threatened to yank federal funding if state or local governments fail to cooperate with immigration enforcement, as required by federal law.\n\nDHS on Monday released its first weekly list of local jails and jurisdictions that the Trump administration wants to shame for failing to honor immigrant \"detainer\" requests. Those requests ask local law enforcement to hold inmates who are in the country illegally and have been arrested or charged with a crime for an additional 48 hours after their release date so federal officials can decide whether to pick them up and deport them.\n\nSome mayors and other local leaders have argued that cooperating actually can hurt local law enforcement by undermining trust in the police. Immigrants are less likely to report a crime \u2014 even when they're the victims \u2014 if they fear it could lead to their deportation. As a case in point, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said last month that reports of sexual assault and domestic violence by the city's Latino residents plummeted this year (by 25 percent and 10 percent respectively), apparently in response to fears of deportation if they interact with police or testify in court.\n\nOne leading immigration reform advocate, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., denounced the DOJ's actions, noting, \"The reality is that in most cities, the police have found that acting as deportation police makes it harder to keep their cities safe.\"\n\nIndeed, the sanctuary cities issue, like the larger immigration debate, is inflamed by fears that are not backed up by facts. A study by the libertarian Cato Institute, for instance, found immigrants in the country illegally to be incarcerated at about half the rate of native-born Americans.\n\nCandidate Trump turned sanctuary cities into a central theme of his presidential campaign, right along with his promise to build a wall along our southern border with Mexico \u2014 and have Mexico pay for it. The proposed wall and form of payment now face pitfalls in Washington's world of legislative sausage-making. His plan to stop sanctuary cities is headed for trouble too.\n\nAs Chicago immigration attorney Chirag G. Badlani pointed out to me, U.S. Supreme Court decisions prohibit states or cities from being coerced into action by the federal government with a financial \"gun to the head.\" That's the language of Chief Justice John Roberts in the 2012 Affordable Care Act case.\n\nFederal officials also can't \"commandeer\" state officials to do their work for them under a 1997 decision involving gun purchases under the Brady Act.\n\nUltimately, the best way to deal with the complicated issue of immigration is through comprehensive immigration reform. But that would require the thoughtful and rigorous debate and compromise that can't seem to climb over the wall dividing both political parties these days.\n\nClarence Page, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/pagespage.\n\ncpage@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @cptime", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-25", "authors": "Clarence Page", "type": "article"}
