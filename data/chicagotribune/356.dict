Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public.\n\n\"The problem they've got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,\" said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump.\n\nThe infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller.\n\n\"This weekend was a disgrace and it's all on your shoulders,\" Scarborough intoned.\n\nHis commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., recently appeared, he received a congratulatory call from Trump just moments later.\n\nScarborough's monologue encapsulated many of the hallmarks of the new White House: It was direct, passionate and provocative, and it played out on live television.\n\nScarborough's analysis aligned with a faction of the West Wing that has grown concerned about the ascent of Miller and Bannon, close partners in driving Trump to make good on his most populist and nationalistic campaign promises, however incendiary.\n\nOne area of heated debate is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal protection to undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children - commonly known as \"dreamers.\" Hardline conservatives have been urging Trump to rescind DACA, while other advisers, including Gingrich, are counseling him to keep it in place and avoid a politically treacherous confrontation, according to people involved in the deliberations.\n\n\"Why pick a fight over this group of people who have a lot of emotional stories to tell? It's not realistic. It's not practical,\" Gingrich said. \"I strongly agree with the general direction we're going, but I think this particular fight doesn't emotionally make any sense.\"\n\nIn many ways, Trump's leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials - Bannon and Miller chief among them - are actively shaping policy and guiding the president's decisions. Others - such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer - function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions.\n\nThe Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus's wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception.\n\nThe competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues' motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.\n\n\"A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing,\" one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. \"We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he's seeing shadows where there are no shadows.\"\n\nDuring the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions.\n\nBut Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker, Robert Costa", "type": "article"}
