His earlier statements to that effect were clearly in error and he called Mr. Obama yesterday to apologize.\n\nAt the same time, President Trump acknowledges that National Park Service photographs have confirmed that his inauguration crowd was far smaller than President Obama's. Furthermore, he concedes that there were not millions of fraudulent votes cast in last November's election.\n\nContrary to usual practice, the president is making this a working weekend. He will be meeting by videoconference with several world leaders to assure them that America will continue to safeguard the military security of our allies and that our country is once again open to mutually beneficial free trade agreements.\n\nAs for the budget, President Trump now recognizes that it was a mistake. He admits that arithmetic is not his strongest suit and that some of the numbers just didn't add up. Thus, there will be no extra military spending, infrastructure renewal will be scaled back significantly and full funding will be continued for the State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, President Trump will call Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to further discuss his border wall proposal. He now acknowledges that the proposed wall is far too expensive and would serve no useful purpose. He will also withdraw his demand that Mexico pay for the wall and express his regret to the Mexican president for suggesting the idea.\n\nPresident Trump also will be rescinding his latest travel ban. He concedes that his changes to the proposed ban do not cure the constitutional defects pointed out by the courts for which, by the way, he has the greatest respect.\n\nThe president also will be issuing a public statement to the media expressing his sincere regret for calling many of them \"failing,\" \"lying\" or \"fake.\" As always, he is totally committed to the First Amendment and the essential function the press corps performs in protecting American democracy.\n\nThe president will on Saturday ask for Steve Bannon's resignation. He has come to realize that Mr. Bannon's plan to disrupt, dismantle and destroy the administrative state is counterproductive to the interests of the vast majority of citizens. Further, he was unaware of Mr. Bannon's self-appointment to the National Security Council and finds such an action unprecedented and dangerous.\n\nFinally, given the seriousness of the Office of the President of the United States, President Trump will today officially cancel his Twitter account. At the same time, he wishes to say to all Americans: \"APRIL FOOL!\"\n\nDavid Martin lives in Ottawa, Ontario.
