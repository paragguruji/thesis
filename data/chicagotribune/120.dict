The law firm's website says Conway has extensive experience in litigation involving securities, mergers and acquisitions, contracts and antitrust cases. He graduated from Harvard and Yale Law School. He joined the law firm in 1988, soon after his graduation from law school.\n\nHe has been involved in numerous complex, high-profile cases with that firm, where he has been a partner since 1994. In the 1990s, Conway wrote the Supreme Court brief that cleared the way for Paula Jones' civil suit against President Clinton. Clinton's denial of an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky during a deposition in the Jones case led to his impeachment.\n\nThe White House and the Justice Department would not confirm the pick Saturday. George Conway declined to comment.\n\nKellyanne Conway is a longtime Republican pollster who helped turn around Trump's presidential campaign at a critical time last summer. She joined the campaign as a senior advisor and quickly earned the candidate's trust. She is also close with the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, another influential voice in Trump's inner circle.\n\nKellyanne Conway stepped in to manage Trump's campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton when it began foundering in the face of a series of controversies. Many credit her with boosting him toward his election victory after she urged him to more closely follow the teleprompter in his speeches and helped him deliver clearer talking points that minimized controversy in the final days of the campaign.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Associated Press", "type": "article"}
