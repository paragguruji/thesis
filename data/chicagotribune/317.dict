On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) fought back tears as he announced that Democrats would introduce legislation to stop the order.\n\n\"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" he said, flanked by refugees at a news conference in New York. \"Look at these faces! Are they any kind of threat to America? No, they're the promise of America.\"\n\nSchumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. And in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump's order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin.\n\n\"I think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support, that overturns the ban,\" Murphy said. \"(The president) clearly campaigned on this ban, but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nGiven that stance, Murphy said, Democrats must \"force a debate\" this week on Trump's order by slowing consideration of the president's remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, his choice to serve as the next secretary of state.\n\n\"We should take every ounce of time that we're allowed on these nominees, to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration, especially when it comes to foreign policy,\" he said.\n\nSchumer and Democrats are eager to move quickly because they believe there is a rare opportunity to ride a wave of GOP opposition to Trump's moves. Democrats argue that one of the only ways they can influence policymaking in the next two years is to drive a wedge between Trump and members of his own party.\n\nAt his news conference, Schumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and others.\n\nDetails of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants' rights issues, aides said. Schumer was working to coordinate the proposals Sunday; Murphy said he had received a call from the leader early in the day to confer.\n\nDemocratic leaders were also exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump's orders - with the party seeking to once again tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has taken a leading role in Democratic messaging, said Sunday that the Senate needs \"to pass legislation immediately which effectively rescinds Trump's un-American and unconstitutional ban on people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States\" and to slow the nomination process.\n\n\"Almost without exception, Trump's Cabinet nominees are extremely controversial and way outside of the American mainstream,\" Sanders said. \"In my view, the Senate needs to take as much time as possible on the floor for a full discussion and debate about each of these nominees.\"\n\nFor the party's restive base, that fight - just nine days into the new president's term - could not come soon enough. While Democrats have embraced the protests against Trump and Republican policies, and while some helped organize more than 70 rallies on Jan. 15 against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, progressives have criticized the party for not voting en masse against Trump's Cabinet picks.\n\n\"You better show up ready to do real work on Monday after all this pro bono work we, the people, did for you on our day off,\" said CNN host W. Kamau Bell in a Saturday night tweet.\n\nIn several cases, Democratic lawmakers took one of the most basic steps available to them as members of Congress: They provided services for constituents. Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo after their arrival.\n\nIn Houston, where the candidates for DNC roles participated in the second of four \"future forums,\" activists filled a ballroom at Texas Southern University to ask why Democrats were not doing more. One attendee could be heard shouting, \"Elizabeth Warren sold us out,\" a reference to her committee vote in favor of Ben Carson's nomination to become secretary for health and human services.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "David Weigel, Ed O'Keefe", "type": "article"}
