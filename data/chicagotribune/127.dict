Conway and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said it would come Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important week in this White House, where the president is going to continue to act on, along with the Congress, major pieces of his legislative and executive agenda,\u201d Conway said on Fox News' \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d citing the travel ban order as one piece of Trump's plan.\n\nConway said the order contained \u201csix or seven major points\u201d that clarify who would be covered. In addition to removing Iraq from the list of seven Muslim-majority nations covered in the initial order, Syrian refugees would be subject to the same 120-day admission ban that refugees from other nations were; initially, Syrian refugees were to be barred indefinitely.\n\nThe new order is to take effect March 16, Conway said.\n\nIn defending the hasty rollout of the initial Jan. 26 directive, White House officials said they were acting with urgency to address an ongoing security threat. But after a Washington state federal judge issued a blanket restraining order to halt its implementation, which was sustained by a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the White House said it would focus on drafting a new order.\n\nDuring a weekend escape to his Mar-a-Lago retreat, Trump dined Saturday with Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, as well as top White House officials involved in the order, including counsel Don McGahn, chief strategist Stephen Bannon and senior policy advisor Stephen Miller.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
