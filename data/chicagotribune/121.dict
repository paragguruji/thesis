Speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d he predicted the Republican replacement would be \u201cwildly successful.\u201d\n\nCritics sharply disagreed.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), interviewed on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d called the GOP plan \u201can absolute disaster\u201d intended to create \u201ca massive shift of wealth from working people and middle-income people to the very richest people in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Republican leadership sought to dilute the impact of the coming budget office forecast, saying it had been off base in the past in predicting the numbers of people who would be able to obtain insurance.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I\u2019m certain will happen is the CBO will say, \u2018Well, gosh. Not as many people will get coverage,\u2019\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), also interviewed on CBS. \u201cYou know why? Because this isn\u2019t a government mandate. This is not the government making you buy what we say you should buy.\u201d\n\nBut even some Trump supporters reiterated doubts about the House version of the healthcare bill. Chief among them was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who urged House colleagues not to \u201cwalk the plank\u201d for a bill that would not pass muster in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe bill can probably be fixed, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of carpentry on that framework,\u201d he said on ABC.\n\nMoreover, conservatives in the Senate believe the Republican plan as it stands does not go far enough to distinguish itself from the Affordable Care Act, said one vocal critic, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nOn CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Paul repeated his forceful earlier criticism, calling the GOP measure \u201cObamacare lite\u201d and adding, \u201cWe are not going to vote for it.\u201d\n\n10:34 a.m.: This story was updated with comment from Sen.
