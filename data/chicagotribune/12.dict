Mr. Trump has explicitly tweeted: \"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\"\n\nTrump lawyers and administration staff aides could understandably have been dismayed at that response.\n\nIt directly and even defiantly harpooned the Trump camp's rationale that religious discrimination against Muslims was not involved but rather that the demands of national security reasonably took precedence.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's decision to revert to his original defense of a \"travel ban\" underscored his determination to speak for himself via Twitter. He did so again despite many calls from within his political circle that he lay off the social media platform.\n\nWhen deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether Mr. Trump's tweets were being vetted by aides, she said, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" In any event, Mr. Trump continues marching to his own drummer, whatever the political consequences.\n\nAndrew Harnik / AP White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders talks to the media.

He was still not accepting that the judiciary branch has irrefutable constitutional powers and rights in its own bailiwick.\n\nMr. Trump has several times reiterated personal animosity toward Muslims, reinforcing the notion that his proposed travel ban is based at its core on religious discrimination. His insistence on calling his first immigration reform initiative a \"travel ban\" seems an open invitation to the full nine-member Supreme Court to deliver him a clear lesson on the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nYet none of this judicial defiance by Mr. Trump appears to offer the means by which his political foes might bring a premature end to his young presidency. In this new era of politics and governing in which Mr. Trump's unfamiliarity shows through so glaringly, it is growing more obvious that this country has elected a president who by inexperience, temperament and lack of knowledge of how government works is woefully in over his head.\n\nHe appears to see neither the wisdom nor the imperative to function within a political system that is far different from the world of real estate and finance, in which muscle matters much more than compromise and finesse.\n\nAll this comes at a time when he rails against the cloud cast by Russian interference in the 2016 election, which was highlighted in last week's testimony by fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nAlex Brandon / AP Former FBI Director James Comey is sworn in during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, June 8, 2017, in Washington.

He has proved to be a master salesman of himself, but he has not yet accepted the constitutional limits placed on the office he has acquired. The Supreme Court will have the opportunity in the \"travel ban\" case to educate him emphatically on it.\n\nJules Witcover is a syndicated columnist and former long-time writer for The Baltimore Sun.
