The change marked the first time since the final year of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency in 2008 that the public in these European countries has expressed more unfavorable than favorable views of the U.S., the survey found.\n\nBush's ratings fell after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 and never fully recovered in some countries, where he was viewed as engaging in \u201ccowboy diplomacy.\u201d\n\nThe shift in European attitudes was disclosed less than two weeks before Trump visits Poland and Germany after the Fourth of July holiday to meet with U.S. allies and other leaders.\n\nTrump\u2019s first overseas trip as president last month took him to the Middle East, Belgium and Italy, where he lectured NATO allies about increasing their defense spending. He also disappointed European and other leaders by refusing to recommit to a landmark climate agreement that the U.S. and other nations had agreed to in 2015.\n\nTrump announced shortly after returning to Washington that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate pact.\n\nThe survey also found scant confidence outside the U.S. in Trump\u2019s ability to lead on the world stage, with fewer than 3 in 10 respondents, or 22%, expressing confidence.\n\nPew has produced the survey annually since 2002, during Bush\u2019s first term. Monday\u2019s edition is the first conducted since Trump took office in January.\n\nAccording to the survey, a median of 22% across all 37 countries surveyed expressed confidence that Trump will do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. That means that if the results from each country are ranked in order, 22% is the midpoint, with the percentage expressing confidence in Trump falling above or below that point in equal numbers of countries.\n\nThe 22% rating also marks a steep drop from the closing years of Barack Obama's presidency, when a median of 64% expressed confidence in Obama's global leadership.\n\nThe results are based on telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted among 40,447 respondents in 37 countries in all regions of the world between Feb. 16 and May 8.\n\nThe survey found widespread disapproval of some of Trump's major policies. The promised U.S.-Mexico border wall is opposed by a median of 76% across all 37 countries, rising to 94% in Mexico.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 disagree with Trump's proposals to pull the U.S. out of a landmark climate-change agreement and withdraw from multinational trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump has pulled the U.S. out of both agreements, although the survey was conducted before his June 2 announcement on exiting the Paris climate accord.\n\nMore than 60% disapprove of Trump's proposal for a temporary ban on people entering the U.S. from six majority Muslim countries. More than half the respondents in four countries \u2014 Hungary, Israel, Poland and Russia \u2014 support the proposal. Opposition was strong in several largely Muslim countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Senegal.\n\nU.S. courts had blocked two versions of Trump's travel ban, but he won a partial victory Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court said he could go forward with a limited version of the ban. The high court also agreed to hear arguments in the case in October. The ban applies to visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nWhile 55% see Trump as a strong leader, larger majorities of those surveyed said they see him as arrogant, 75%; intolerant, 65%; and dangerous, 62%.\n\nCAPTION California Atty.
