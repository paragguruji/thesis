The company on Monday revised up the total from an initial estimate of 143 million following the completion of a review by an outside cybersecurity firm.\n\n\u201cEquifax was entrusted with Americans\u2019 private data and we let them down,\u201d Richard Smith said in written testimony for the hearing that the House Energy and Commerce Committee released Monday. \u201cTo each and every person affected by this breach, I am deeply sorry that this occurred.\u201d\n\nSmith stepped down last week in the wake of the breach, which has sparked numerous federal and state investigations as well as outrage from lawmakers. His appearance Tuesday before the House panel will be the first of three before congressional committees this week.\n\nIn his written testimony, Smith blamed the breach on \u201chuman error and technology failures\u201d and said the company was a victim of \u201ca massive theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company failed to prevent sensitive information from falling into the hands of wrongdoers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe people affected by this are not numbers in a database. They are my friends, my family, members of my church, the members of my community, my neighbors,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis breach has impacted all of them. It has impacted all of us.\u201d\n\nSmith also said Equifax was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the rollout of a special website and call centers to deal with the fallout from the breach. The company \u201cstruggled with the initial effort\u201d to help consumers, he said.\n\nEquifax has been criticized for waiting nearly six weeks to notify the public after learning of the hack July 29, and then initially making consumers give up their right to sue if they wanted free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Equifax later backtracked on that requirement.\n\nSmith said in his testimony that \u201cregrettably, mistakes were made\u201d in the company\u2019s effort to help millions of consumers deal with the data breach.\n\nThe arbitration provision \u201chad simply been inadvertently\u201d included in the terms of conditions for the credit monitoring after someone \u201cessentially \u2018cut and pasted' \u201c the wording from a different Equifax product, he said.\n\nIn response to criticism of its efforts, Equifax said last week it would stop charging customers to freeze access to their credit records so that no data would be released to scammers. In his testimony, Smith called for such free credit freezes to be the industry standard and that the nation should consider replacing Social Security numbers \u201cas the touchstone for identity verification.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe redirecting the debate in this manner is a big positive for the firm,\u201d wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with brokerage and investment bank Cowen & Co., in a research report. \u201cThis is a way to give members of Congress a way to react to the crisis where Equifax is part of the solution rather than the target of attack.\u201d\n\nBut Seiberg noted that Smith\u2019s prepared testimony failed to address the controversy regarding possible insider trading by some Equifax executives before the data breach became public.\n\nOn Aug. 1, three Equifax executives sold thousands of shares of stock. All the shares sold for about $146 each. The company\u2019s stock sharply declined after the data breach was announced. Shares closed at $107.81 Monday, up about 1.7% but still down about 24% since the hack.\n\nEquifax\u2019s board of directors has formed a special committee and is \u201cconducting a thorough review of the trading at issue,\u201d Theodore M. Hester, an attorney retained by Equifax, said in a letter Friday to Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n\u201cEquifax takes these matters seriously,\u201d Hester wrote.\n\nThe stock sales were among several questions about the data breach that the lawmakers had asked Smith about in a Sept. 12 letter.\n\nSmith said the data breach problems started March 8 when the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Computer Emergency Readiness Team sent a notice to Equifax and other companies about the need to patch a vulnerability in software known as Apache Struts.\n\nEquifax sent emails about the federal warning to workers responsible for the software, which is used in the company\u2019s consumer online disputes portal. But the \u201cvulnerable versions\u201d of the software were not identified or patched, Smith said.\n\n\u201cEquifax\u2019s efforts undertaken in March 2017 did not identify any versions of Apache Struts that were subject to this vulnerability, and the vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have,\u201d Smith said. The company is investigating why.\n\nHackers appear to have first used the software vulnerability to access sensitive information May 13 and continued to do so for weeks before Equifax\u2019s security team identified suspicious network traffic July 29.\n\nThe next day, Equifax took the web portal offline.\n\nSmith said he learned about the problem July 31 from the company\u2019s chief information officer. A full response began Aug. 2, including contacting the FBI, Smith said.\n\nEquifax and an independent cybersecurity forensic consulting firm, Mandiant, worked \u201cliterally around the clock\u201d to figure out what happened, Smith said. But despite numerous internal discussions, Equifax did not publicly announce the breach until Sept. 7.\n\nSmith said one reason for the delay was that experts had told company executives that notifying the public \u201cwould provoke \u2018copycat attempts\u2019 and other criminal activity.\u201d\n\nEquifax said Monday that Mandiant had completed the forensic portion of its review and found that as many as 2.5 million more U.S. customers might have been affected.\n\nThe review also has concluded that there is no evidence the attackers accessed databases located outside of the United States, the company said.\n\nEquifax is trying to help consumers while also fixing its security systems, he said. The company\u2019s \u201cvulnerability scanning and patch management processes and procedures\u201d have been enhanced, Smith said.\n\nSmith noted that in addition to his departure, the company\u2019s chief information officer and chief security officer also left the company after the breach.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
