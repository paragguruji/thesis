The state is also asking for a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the order.\n\n\"We are a country based on the rule of law and in a courtroom it is not the loudest voice that prevails, it's the Constitution,\" Ferguson said. \"At the end of the day, either you're abiding by the Constitution or you are not. And in our view, the president is not adhering to the Constitution when it comes to this executive action.\"\n\nDeclarations of support from Amazon and Expedia \u2014 two Washington state-based businesses \u2014 will be filed with the lawsuit, said Ferguson, who was joined at the news conference by Gov. Jay Inslee.\n\nThe complaint claims that Trump's actions are separating Washington families, harming thousands of state residents, damaging the state economy, hurting Washington-based companies \"and undermining Washington's sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees,\" Ferguson said.\n\nInslee said the \"inhumanity\" of Trump's order is obvious.\n\n\"This is un-American, it is wrong, and it will not stand,\" Inslee said. \"The clear intent of this executive order is to discriminate against one faith amongst all God's children.\"\n\nAsked if he fears retaliation from the Trump administration, Inslee said \"there's no predicting this president, but we will not yield, we will not be leveraged, we will not be threatened, we will not be intimidated.\"\n\nInslee said he learned the hard way over the years \"you do not back down to bullies.\"\n\nFerguson said he has been in contact with other attorneys general but at this point Washington state was acting on its own regarding the legal action.\n\nThe Port of Seattle said over the weekend that people who were detained at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as a result of Trump's order have been released.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Sunday that two individuals were released. One is a citizen of Sudan and the other a citizen of Yemen, both countries named in Trump's order.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
