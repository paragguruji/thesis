Jay Inslee, a Democrat who leads one of the states that challenged the ban, said: \"Mr. President, we just saw you in court, and we beat you.\"\n\nThe panel declined to block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travelers to enter the U.S. But it did not shy away from the larger constitutional questions raised by the order.\n\nThe judges sided with the states on every issue except for one technical matter. They rejected the administration's argument that courts did not have the authority to review the president's immigration and national security decisions. They said the administration failed to show that the order met constitutional requirements to provide notice or a hearing before restricting travel. And they said the administration presented no evidence that any foreigner from the seven countries was responsible for a terrorist attack in the U.S.\n\n\"Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years,\" the panel wrote.\n\nThe court battle is far from over. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court seems likely. That could put the decision in the hands of a divided court that has a vacancy. Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is unlikely to be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban, which was set to expire in 90 days unless it is changed.\n\nThe appellate judges noted compelling public interests on both sides.\n\n\"On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said it was \"reviewing the decision and considering its options.\" It's the first day on the job for new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was sworn in at the White House earlier Thursday by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The ban temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns.\n\nNuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune Baraa Haj Khalaf, left, gets a kiss from her brother, Uday Haj Khalaf, after arriving at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Feb. 7, 2017, as a federal appeals court heard arguments on whether to restore President Donald Trump's immigration order.

(Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune)\n\nJustice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\n\nThe states said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.\n\nThe appeals court sided with the administration on just one issue. The states had argued that 9th Circuit precedent prohibits review of temporary restraining orders. The panel said that due to the intense public interest at stake and the uncertainty of how long it would take to obtain a further ruling from the lower court, it was appropriate to consider the federal government's appeal.\n\nEvan Vucci / AP President Donald Trump speaks to the Major County Sheriffs' Association and Major Cities Chiefs Association, in Washington on Feb. 8, 2017.

(Evan Vucci / AP) (Evan Vucci / AP)\n\nJosh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the \"million-dollar question\" is whether the Trump administration would appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThat could run the risk of having only eight justices to hear the case, which could produce a tie and leave the lower-court ruling in place.\n\n\"There's a distinct risk in moving this too quickly,\" Blackman said. \"But we're not in a normal time, and Donald Trump is very rash. He may trump, pardon the figure of speech, the normal rule.\"\n\nJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said the ruling was thoughtful and supported by a great deal of legal precedent. More important, it was unanimous despite the fact that the panel included judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nJeff Chiu / AP Karen Shore holds up a sign outside of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017.

That's why they're appointed for life, so they don't worry about what's popular. They worry about what's legally correct.\"\n\nAfter the ban was put on hold, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports around the country.\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Gene Johnson and Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Sudhin Thanawala", "type": "article"}
