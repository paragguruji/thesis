We're looking into the exact nature of it, and I'll try to have more for you later.\"\n\nIran was among the seven predominantly Muslim countries targeted in President Trump\u2019s controversial executive action signed Friday that blocked its citizens from entering the United States.\n\nChristopher Harmer, a military analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a nonpartisan public policy group in Washington, said that it\u2019s impossible to know if Tehran conducted the test as a response to the president\u2019s action, but that the test also serves as propaganda.\n\n\u201cIran is always working on every aspect of its missile program: better guidance, more payload capacity, and better reliability,\u201d he said. \u201cThey test often so it\u2019s difficult to say for sure whether this is a response to the travel ban, but the timing is suspect.\u201d\n\nTrump, as a presidential candidate, was deeply critical of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated.\"\n\nIran had agreed to strict constraints on its atomic program in exchange for an end to economic sanctions that had throttled the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nU.N. Resolution 2231, passed shortly after the nuclear deal was signed, calls on Iran \u201cnot to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. will now determine whether the launch was a violation.\n\nIran has repeatedly maintained that missile development is within its rights to self-defense against attack from Israel, its longtime regional adversary. The missile arsenal was never designed to be tipped with nuclear warheads, Tehran has said, therefore it should face no U.N. restrictions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a statement on his Facebook page that called the test a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of the resolution. He added that he intended to \u201craise the renewal of sanctions against Iran in this context and in other contexts\u201d when he meets Trump at the White House on Feb. 15.\n\nThe Obama administration slapped sanctions on Iran in January 2016 after a series of Iranian test launches. Iranian officials have mocked the U.S. actions as futile and belligerent.\n\nwilliam.hennigan@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @wjhenn", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "W.J.
