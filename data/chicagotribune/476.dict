I think it's a horrible idea. I feel for all the people who are affected. Families are being torn apart and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world.\"\n\nMalcolm Kerr was murdered while he was the American University president in Beirut when Steve Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona.\n\nKerr has been outspoken on matters including gun control. He also expressed his disappointment when Trump was elected, likening his campaign to The Jerry Springer Show.\n\nThe White House on Sunday defended Trump's immigration restrictions as protests spread throughout the country. The executive order also suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
