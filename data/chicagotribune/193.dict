It appears to set the stage for a battle in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which last month upheld a ruling blocking Trump\u2019s original travel ban.\n\n\u00bb UPDATE: Federal judge in Maryland blocks Trump's revised travel ban\n\nRuling separately in a Maryland federal court Thursday, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang issued a more limited order halting the travel ban. Chuang\u2019s ruling focused on blocking the ban\u2019s provision that paused immigration from the six countries.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Nashville on Wednesday after the court decision landed, Trump said it was a \u201cterrible ruling\u201d that \u201cmakes us look weak.\u201d He called it \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach\u201d and vowed to \u201ctake our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nTrump said the new order was simply a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the prior one.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d he told the roaring crowd.\n\nThe case, brought by Hawaii Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin, argued that the latest travel ban would have \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on residents, businesses and universities. In its complaint, the state of Hawaii also said the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nLawyers for the state also argued that the order illegally discriminates based upon nationality.\n\nArguing that Hawaii residents would be unfairly affected by the ban, lawyers cited the example of Ismail Elshikh, a naturalized U.S. citizen who is the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii. His mother-in-law is a national of Syria and would be barred from seeing her son-in-law.\n\nIn his 43-page order, Watson, who was nominated to the bench by President Obama, repeatedly referred to statements by Trump and his associates during the campaign and afterward as evidence that the executive order was intended to restrict Muslim immigration. Watson wrote that despite the ban\u2019s \u201cstated secular purpose,\u201d Trump\u2019s own words acted against him by marking the travel order as a fulfillment of the president\u2019s campaign promise to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe illogic of the government\u2019s contention is palpable,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cThe notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nGovernment lawyers have argued that the travel restrictions did not amount to a Muslim ban, as opponents have said, since they only would apply to a fraction of the world\u2019s Muslim population.\n\nThe Department of Justice pushed back against the Hawaii court late Wednesday but did not indicate its next steps in the case.\n\n\"The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe president's executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation's security, and the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts.\"\n\nThe Hawaii hearing was among four court proceedings Wednesday in which the travel ban was challenged. There were two hearings in Seattle and another in Greenbelt, Md.\n\nI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way. \u2014 President Trump\n\nLawyers challenging the ban \u2014 which was scheduled to begin at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Thursday \u2014 asked judges to put it on hold while the courts decided its constitutionality.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys argued that the travel ban was necessary for national security and that it was well within the president\u2019s powers to restrict immigration to protect the nation. The aim, they said, was to screen out visitors from countries affected by terrorism until more stringent vetting measures could be put in place.\n\nGovernment lawyers said that the travel ban, a revised version of the Jan. 27 executive order that was blocked by federal courts, was modified enough to remove any legal concerns.\n\nDemocratic state officials and civil rights groups cheered the Hawaii ruling.\n\n\u201cIt appeared the judge was not willing to buy the federal government\u2019s contention that they just need to stick to the neutral language\u201d on religion, said Chin, the Hawaii attorney general, at a news conference with Gov. David Ige.\n\n\u201cA win for Hawaii is a win for all of us,\u201d Washington state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson said outside the courthouse in Seattle where a judge heard two other challenges to the travel restrictions. \u201cTrump is piling up defeat after defeat after defeat. And we\u2019ll all be here working to make sure his streak continues.\u201d\n\nNihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement the group welcomed the Hawaii decision as \u201cconfirmation of the strength of our nation's system of checks and balances.\u2026 We urge the Trump administration to scrap this Muslim ban entirely because it disrespects both the Constitution and America's longstanding tradition of religious freedom and inclusion.\"\n\nTrump is piling up defeat after defeat after defeat. And we\u2019ll all be here working to make sure his streak continues. \u2014 Bob Ferguson, Washington state attorney general\n\nHis group has also sued over the travel restrictions in a separate case that is pending.\n\nThe original order spurred tens of thousands of visa cancellations, chaos at U.S. international airports and dozens of lawsuits.\n\nThat order stopped refugee resettlement from all countries for 120 days \u2014 and from Syria indefinitely \u2014 and banned citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days while the government was to review its vetting procedures.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle halted that order in February after hearing arguments that it was discriminatory against Muslims and negatively impacted Washington state\u2019s universities, businesses and residents. His decision was upheld by a motions panel of three judges in the 9th Circuit.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "authors": "Jaweed Kaleem", "type": "article"}
