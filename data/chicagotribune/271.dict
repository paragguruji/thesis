Wearing a white prisoner jump suit, his hands and feet shackled, he stared down at the floor and fidgeted, but did not speak.\n\nThe 27-year-old suspect, who has espoused support for Le Pen and U.S. President Donald Trump on his Facebook page, was known to those who monitor extremist groups in Quebec, said Fran\u00e7ois Deschamps, an official with a refugee advocacy group.\n\nJacques Boissinot / The Canadian Press via AP Alexandre Bissonnette is escorted to a van after appearing in court on Jan. 30, 2017.

Her views have won the endorsement from white supremacists.\n\nMore than 50 people were at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre when the shooting began, and witnesses described a scene of chaos as worshippers scrambled to find friends and loved ones. In addition to the six dead, 19 people were wounded \u2014 all men. Of the five victims who remained hospitalized, two were in critical condition, authorities said. The dead ranged in age from 39 to 60.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard both characterized the attack as a terrorist act, which came amid strong criticism around the world over Trump's temporary travel ban for people from seven Muslim countries.\n\nAn unconfirmed number of people died Sunday evening in a shooting at a mosque in the provincial capital of Quebec City, police said. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard termed the act \"barbaric violence\" and expressed solidarity with the victims' families.

The previous separatist government of the province called for a ban on ostentatious religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions.\n\nTrudeau said in Parliament that the victims were targeted simply because of their religion. Speaking directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, he said, \"We are with you.\"\n\n\"Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe prime minister later attended a vigil along with thousands of people bundled in winter clothes in front of Notre-Dame-de-Foy Church, just around the corner from the mosque that was attacked. It was one of many vigils in Canada, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris was darkened in respect to the victims as was the CN Tower in Toronto.\n\nThe suspect was arrested in his car on a bridge near d'Orleans, after he called 911 to say he wanted to cooperate with police. Authorities, who initially named two suspects, said the other man taken into custody was a witness to the attack and was released. Officials said they did not believe there were others involved but were investigating.\n\nPolice did not give a motive for the attack.\n\nAndre Pichette / EPA A general view shows the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre (R) after two gunmen reportedly opened fire, in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, 30 January 2017.

It's a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be pro-active, rather than reactive when it comes to our nation's safety and security,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.\n\nThe victims were businessmen, a university professor and others who had gathered for evening prayers, said Mohamed Labidi, vice president of the mosque.\n\n\"'It's a very, very big tragedy for us,\" Labidi said tearfully. \"We have a sadness we cannot express.\"\n\nHe said the victims were shot in the back.\n\n\"Security at our mosque was our major, major concern,\" he said. \"But we were caught off guard.\"\n\nAsked if he blamed recent rhetoric in in the U.S. for the attack, the Quebec premier said he would \"not go there\"\n\n\"Quebec is a good, generally loving society, but we have these devils as other societies have. We have to recognize that and fight them,\" Couillard said at a news conference at which he and Muslim leaders held hands in a display of solidarity.\n\nThe mosque has been a target of hate crimes in the past, including last summer when a pig's head was left on its doorstep during Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
