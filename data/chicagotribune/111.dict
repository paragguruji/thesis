But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.\u201d\n\nIt's not the first time that Carson, who was confirmed last week, has discussed slavery in the political sphere. In 2013, he called Obamacare \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama made similar comments at a naturalization ceremony.\n\n\"Life in America was not always easy. It wasn\u2019t always easy for new immigrants. Certainly it wasn\u2019t easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves,\" he said.\n\nObama's remarks gained renewed attention Tuesday night when \"The Daily Show\" host Trevor Noah discussed them after conservative news outlets had reported earlier in the day.\n\nUpdated on March 8 at 11:20 a.m.: This post has been updated with information about Obama's remarks.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Colleen Shalby", "type": "article"}
