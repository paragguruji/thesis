Two federal appeals courts blocked those portions of the order, which the Supreme Court partially lifted Monday for anyone who had \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"\n\n\"The people for whom the stay was lifted ends up being a very small group,\" said Ed Yohnka, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. \"Anybody who is coming here as a refugee or in any kind of situation like that will have been in contact with an organization or individuals for quite some period of time. ... The administration didn't get much out of this.\"\n\nStill, immigration advocates say the ruling sends the wrong message about the character of the U.S. and uses national security as an excuse to violate immigration laws and diminish core American values. The ruling's ambiguity about what qualifies as a bona fide relationship also creates concern. Whether a connection to a resettlement agency counts remains in question.\n\n\"This decision will continue to make the work of resettling refugees harder,\" said Sam Tuttle, director of policy and advocacy for Heartland Alliance for Human Needs & Human Rights. \"We continue to be concerned that the administration's executive orders make refugees and other people seeking safety in this country feel unwelcome and not wanted. And that shouldn't be the message from the United States of America.\"\n\nHeartland Alliance was expecting about a dozen arrivals of refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Myanmar between now and the end of July. It wasn't clear on Monday how the ruling would affect those arrivals.\n\nMary Meg McCarthy, executive director of Heartland Alliance's National Immigrant Justice Center, said even though people with family members, job offers, academic appointments or acceptance letters from schools in the U.S. should be permitted to come, they \"will face new evidentiary burdens in order to establish travel eligibility.\"\n\nImmigration attorney Ian Wagreich, a co-founder of the Travelers Assistance Project, an opportunity for people heading to Chicago to register their itineraries for tailored legal support, said the confusion and lack of consistent enforcement in the past will almost certainly generate a flood of new calls and registrants for the project.\n\n\"It's really going to raise the question of what is a bona fide relationship or entity in the U.S.,\" he said. \"It's completely ambiguous.\"\n\nFred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said the fact that the court agreed to hear the case in the fall is disturbing.\n\n\"For the court to revisit the injunctions is another disturbing step,\" he said. \"To narrow the injunctions in the way that they did raises as many questions as it answers.\"\n\nmbrachear@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @TribSeeker", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": "Manya Brachear Pashman", "type": "article"}
