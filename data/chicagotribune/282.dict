Kennedy, the 81-year old Reagan appointee who regularly holds the deciding vote when the rest of the court is evenly split along ideological lines.\n\nAll eyes will be on Kennedy even more than normal as this year\u2019s term could be his last. The justice has turned away questions about his plans, but Republicans on Capitol Hill predict Kennedy will retire soon, although, of course, they predicted the same thing last year. If Kennedy does step down, President Trump could replace him with a younger, more reliable conservative and tilt the court decidedly to the right.\n\nFor now, however, lawyers in the biggest cases will focus on how to win over Kennedy. That explains why the gay rights laws in the blue states and the partisan election maps in the red states are both being challenged as threats to the 1st Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech.\n\nKennedy has been the court\u2019s leader in striking down laws that discriminated against gays and lesbians, but he also has been a steady champion of free speech. Religious rights advocates insist that religious freedom is in danger in this country, but in court, they rely mostly on the 1st Amendment principle that the government cannot force someone to speak its message.\n\nThat\u2019s the issue in one of the most hotly watched cases this term, which involves a Colorado baker of wedding cakes. Advocates for religious conservatives want the court to break new ground and rule that business owners whose work is \u201cexpressive\u201d have a free-speech right to refuse to comply with civil rights laws, at least those which protect same-sex couples.\n\nJack Phillips, the baker, turned away two men who asked for a wedding cake, and he was charged with violating the state\u2019s civil rights law. Along with 20 other states, Colorado requires a business open to the public to provide \u201cfull and equal\u201d service to all customers without regard to their sexual orientation.\n\nLawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom describe the baker as a \u201ccake artist.\u201d The Supreme Court agreed to hear his claim that the state cannot force a person to endorse or help celebrate a same-sex marriage by making a special wedding cake. The Trump administration came to Phillips\u2019 support and urged the court to carve out a \u201cnarrow\u201d exemption to gay rights laws that would allow photographers, florists, musicians and others whose work is \u201cexpressive\u201d to refuse to participate in a same-sex marriage. The court will hear the case, Masterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado, after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe meaning of free speech also lies at the core of a Wisconsin case in which Democrats and liberals want the court to strike down the highly partisan electoral maps that permit one party to entrench itself in power for a decade or more.\n\nAlthough the case directly involves just one house of the Legislature in one state, control of the U.S. House of Representatives could be at stake, depending on the outcome.\n\nWisconsin Republicans drew legislative district lines in 2011 that virtually guaranteed they would control at least 60 of the 99 seats in the state Assembly, the lower house of Wisconsin\u2019s Legislature.\n\nThe effort worked as planned. The next year, 51% of Wisconsin\u2019s voters cast ballots for Democrats, but the GOP maintained its 60-seat hold on the assembly. The challenge to that effort, what Democrats call a partisan gerrymander, Gill vs. Whitford, will be heard Tuesday.\n\nWisconsin Democrats argue the GOP\u2019s electoral map violates their 1st Amendment rights because their views will never have majority support in the state house barring an \u201cunprecedented political earthquake.\u201d\n\nTheir argument, like the one in the baker\u2019s case, is aimed at Kennedy. The last time the high court considered political gerrymandering \u2014 and decided not to act \u2014 Kennedy wrote that the court might be more open to a future appeal based on free-speech principles.\n\n\u201cThe 1st Amendment may be the more relevant constitutional provision in future cases,\u201d he wrote in that 2004 case, noting that states arguably were \u201cpenalizing citizens because \u2026 of their association with a political party or their expression of political views.\u201d\n\nThe same sort of techniques that Republicans used in the Wisconsin Legislature also played a big role in redistricting nationally after the 2010 Census. Republicans took full control that year in battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina, and they drew electoral maps that tilted strongly in their favor. The lines were drawn to concentrate Democratic voters in a few districts while assuring Republicans a safe advantage in the vast majority of districts.\n\nThose states all voted for President Obama at least once, and they are closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. That is not apparent in the House of Representatives. The four states have 61 seats in the House: 44 Republicans and 17 Democrats.\n\nAt least two states \u2014 Maryland and Massachusetts \u2014 were gerrymandered to help Democrats win extra House seats, but the Brennan Center in New York estimated that \u201caggressive gerrymanders\u201d have given Republicans a net advantage of 17 seats in Congress. In 2018, Democrats would need to win 24 Republican-held seats to capture the majority.\n\nAs a result, a ruling that limits partisan gerrymanders could undermine the Republican congressional majority.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly important case for American democracy,\u201d said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThis is about a political party\u2019s abuse of its power to lock in a majority for itself and to rig the election before it takes place.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-28", "authors": "David G.
