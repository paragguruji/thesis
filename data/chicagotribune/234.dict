School leaders scrambled throughout the weekend to assess which students, faculty and academic programming would be affected by the restrictions and to ascertain whether anyone was stuck abroad. They also warned of the policy's long-term effects on higher education.\n\n\"We are greatly concerned about the negative consequences for members of our community and their families arising from President Trump's recent executive order instituting changes in immigration policy,\" said U. of I. President Timothy Killeen, who originally is from Wales and was a green card holder before becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\nThere are more than 150 people from the affected countries at U. of I.'s Urbana-Champaign campus and 184 students, research scholars, faculty and staff at UIC, school officials said. U. of I. is not aware of any students, faculty or staff who are currently overseas and unable to return to the United States, Killeen said.\n\nThere were more than 17,000 students from the seven countries studying in the United States during the 2015-16 academic year, according to the nonprofit Institute of International Education.\n\nThe American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which has a membership of 420 four-year state colleges and universities, said the ban could have a negative effect on students and scholars across the country. But the organization has been struggling to issue definitive counsel to its members because of confusion in the way the executive order has been implemented and who is affected.\n\nProtesters rallied at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017, after travelers were held, including those with green cards and visas, following President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration.

The Department of Homeland Security first said the ban extended to legal U.S. residents, then reversed course Sunday night when Secretary John Kelly issued a statement deeming \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\"\n\nIn addition to the confusion in academia, the ban led to mass protests at major international airports throughout the weekend as arriving travelers were held by immigration authorities, and in some cases, sent back to their home countries. U.S. citizens and those holding green cards were among those stopped and questioned by immigration authorities.\n\nDozens of Chicago-area lawyers camped out at O'Hare International Airport throughout the weekend to assist travelers who were being detained.\n\nOf the 17 people held at O'Hare on Saturday, three had student visas to allow them to legally enter the country, according to a database maintained by lawyers at the airport. All three are listed as being from Pakistan, which is not one of the countries listed in the ban. It was not immediately clear which schools those students attend or the reason they were held.\n\nPhil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune University of Illinois President Timothy Killeen meets with the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board on July 12, 2016.

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune)\n\nMercedes Badia-Tavas, president of the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said she thinks universities are making the right decision in issuing travel advisories. Until the situation becomes more certain, there's too much risk involved for some travelers, she said.\n\n\"That's the problem when you don't have clear instructions on how you implement the order,\" Badia-Tavas said. \"Everyone shoots in the dark and they start detaining everyone.\"\n\nUniversity leaders across the country criticized the executive order, including the president of Purdue University, which has about 100 students and 10 faculty from the affected countries. None have been stranded outside the United States, according to the school.\n\n\"The President's order related to immigration is a bad idea, poorly implemented, and I hope that he will promptly revoke and rethink it,\" Purdue President Mitch Daniels, former Republican governor of Indiana, said in a statement. \"If the idea is to strengthen the protection of Americans against terrorism, there are many far better ways to achieve it.\"\n\nNorthwestern University also cautioned that students from the affected countries should not travel abroad. Northwestern has 71 students, scholars and faculty from Iran, including graduate students with student visas and faculty and scholars visiting the university as postdoctoral candidates and researchers, according to statistics from Northwestern's international office.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Dawn Rhodes, Vikki Ortiz Healy", "type": "article"}
