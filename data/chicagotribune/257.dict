That could color how he confronts the new limits on his power as he tries to make the kind of sweeping change he expected to deliver on his own.\n\nSigns of struggle inside the White House have emerged between those who want Trump to keep his hyper-aggressive style and those who would like to see him seek more consensus.\n\nSo far, those who like new policies to land with the clatter of breaking glass have had the most sway. But Thursday\u2019s ruling that blocked Trump from suspending the country\u2019s refugee program and travel from seven Muslim-majority countries capped a week that saw his authority under assault on several new fronts.\n\nUtah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who leads the House oversight committee, joined Democrats in calling for an ethics rebuke against senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who promoted the fashion line of Trump\u2019s daughter during a televised interview from the White House.\n\nNational Security Advisor Michael Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian diplomat during the transition, when President Obama was still in office, the Washington Post and others reported, despite prior denials from Flynn and Trump administration officials. The discussions were viewed by experts as inappropriate and perhaps illegal, given the timing.\n\nAnd Trump, in what many saw as weakness on the foreign stage, publicly acceded to Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s demand that he reaffirm the \u201cone China\u201d policy that Trump flouted during the transition when he took a congratulatory call from Taiwan.\n\nDespite historically low popularity ratings and an outward sense of tumult, Trump and those inside the administration continued to express confidence, shaded with defiance, blaming the news media for distorting a fast-moving period that has been popular among Trump\u2019s core supporters.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the totality \u2014 we've issued 25, plus or minus, executive actions, nominated a Supreme Court justice,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, in an interview. \u201cWhen people actually take the time to look at what has happened, it is a pretty amazing first 21 days, amazing and successful 21 days.\u201d\n\nThere are indications that Trump's team is making adjustments on the fly. After the legal setbacks on his travel ban, senior advisors huddled to brainstorm alternate paths that might accomplish similar goals without a drawn-out court battle.\n\nOn Friday, they scrambled over a plan to issue new, more narrowly tailored travel restrictions while they considered whether and how to pursue appeals. While Trump was speaking publicly about his next steps aboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon, top policy and communications advisors back at the White House were still debating how far they should take the appellate process.\n\nPresidents eventually figure out they need to shift power away from campaign aides who helped them win election in favor of the experts in government who can craft policy and manage the bureaucracy more effectively, said Elaine Kamarck, a former aide in the Clinton White House who writes about the office of the presidency.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s now seeing is that a court order actually stops executive action,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he says or what he tweets.\u201d\n\nShe compared the courts\u2019 slapdown of Trump\u2019s travel bans to a shock Clinton faced early in his presidency, when he bungled an attempt to fulfill a campaign promise to allow gays to serve openly in the military.\n\n\u201cIt was a failure to consult with the government before taking action,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton\u2019s advisors urged him to pick his political battles more selectively and seek more input from those who had spent careers navigating the federal government.\n\nTrump has shown hints that he is willing to accept advice, especially as members of his Cabinet win congressional approval and begin offering it. And though he does not sound humbled, Trump has allowed that the stakes are greater than others could grasp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president,\u201d he said Friday during a news conference while speaking about the threat of terrorism.\n\nKamarck saw Trump\u2019s outreach to China as evidence that he is willing to defer to experts and curb some of his more provocative behavior. Yet hours after he moderated on China, Trump refreshed his attack on the judiciary in unusually personal terms that broke presidential norms, calling the appeals court ruling a \u201cdisgrace\u201d on Twitter.\n\nThe dual signals match divisions within Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nOne side is led by nationalist ideologues including Stephen Bannon, the former publisher of the far-right Breitbart News website who serves as Trump\u2019s chief strategist. The more traditional conservative side is led by Reince Priebus, former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nBannon had a strong hand in drafting the overturned immigration order that was issued with little input from others only a week into Trump\u2019s presidency. Though it was temporarily blocked by the appeals court, Trump and his aides said they would keep fighting for the goal.\n\nOne Trump aide, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations, insisted the administration would wage a stronger fight with help from the new secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The official said that Trump\u2019s executive action \u2014 framed by the president as a matter of security \u2014 is a better issue to debate than fending off attacks over ethics relating to Trump\u2019s family businesses or about Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russia.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "authors": "Noah Bierman, Brian Bennett", "type": "article"}
