The courts are slow and political!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThat claim about vetting may come as news to the justices. In their appeals, Justice Department lawyers have urged the high court to act on an emergency basis to revive the travel order.\n\nSpeedy action was needed precisely to allow the government to develop new vetting procedures for people seeking to enter the U.S., the lawyers said. The process of coming up with new vetting procedures was put on hold when lower-court judges blocked Trump\u2019s order from taking effect, they told the high court.\n\nLegal experts said Trump\u2019s latest comments not only undercut the government\u2019s legal strategy, but cast doubt on the need for the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\n\u201cThey said this was a matter of urgency. But if they are already doing the extreme vetting, why do you need an order from the court?\u201d asked Josh Blackman, a Texas law professor and legal blogger.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy the solicitor general,\u201d he added, referring to the government lawyer who represents the administration in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe lawyers on the other side, fighting the Trump team in court, were quick to say they were pleased by the president\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda odd to have the defendant in Hawaii v. Trump acting as our co-counsel,\u201d Neal Katyal, the attorney for Hawaii who has challenged the travel order, said in a tweet of his own. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the help but will take it!\u201d\n\nOmar Jadwat, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said Trump had \u201cundercut the picture the government has been trying to paint.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the government \u201chave made a diligent effort to demonstrate\u201d that the travel order \u201cwas not about religious animus,\u201d he said, nor was it an effort to fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to enact a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d But Trump\u2019s tweets belie those claims, he added.\n\n\u201cIt shows that the ban is a ban, and that\u2019s the goal. It is not about developing new vetting procedures,\u201d he said.\n\nNext week, the ACLU lawyers will file a formal response in the Supreme Court, and Jadwat said he had not yet decided on how to handle the latest tweets. \u201cThey certainly seem relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nEven a notable administration supporter joined the criticism of Trump\u2019s tweeting. George Conway, a prominent New York lawyer who was considered for two top Justice Department posts and is the husband of White House advisor Kellyanne Conway, took to Twitter to say that Trump\u2019s words \u201cwon\u2019t help\u201d the solicitor general win five votes at the high court.\n\nConway followed up with several tweets later in the day in which he said that he still \u201cvery, very strongly\u201d supports Trump and his administration.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cThe point cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS--and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it.\u201d\n\nAnother senior Republican legal figure issued a more scathing assessment of Trump\u2019s statements.\n\n\u201cThe impulsive, uncontrolled, ill-informed President infects the legal soundness of everything his administration does,\u201d Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who served as a top Justice Department official under George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cEverything else Executive would normally win \u2026 will be much, much harder,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president seemed undeterred. On Monday evening, he returned to Twitter.\n\n\u201cThat's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!\u201d he wrote.\n\nLast week, Justice Department lawyers filed a lengthy appeal at the high court that sought to minimize the impact of Trump\u2019s travel order. They said the revised version of the order called for a limited and \u201ctemporary pause\u201d for certain travelers from six countries, not a travel ban.\n\nBut in his tweets on Monday, Trump said he did not agree with his Justice Department or with how it characterized what he planned to do.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump proclaimed.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department should have stayed with the original Travel Ban,\u201d not the scaled-down version that is now before the high court, he added.\n\nThe travel order saga began on Dec. 7, 2015, when then-candidate Trump issued a news release calling \u201cfor a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nWhen he issued the first version of his travel order, on Jan. 27, one week after taking office, opponents called it a thinly disguised effort to enact that religious-based ban on travel. As such, it violated the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of freedom of religion, they said.\n\nFederal judges quickly blocked the first travel order from taking effect.\n\nAfter weeks of vowing to take the case to the Supreme Court, Trump backed away in March, issuing a revised version of the travel order that retreated from many of the controversial parts of the first version.\n\nThe individuals and groups who challenged the revised order, however, say that it remains motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nLast month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the revised order. The ruling leaned heavily on Trump\u2019s statements as a candidate, saying that they provided evidence about the president\u2019s true motivation.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "David G.
