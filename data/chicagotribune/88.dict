Trump, meanwhile, insisted the action is a necessary security precaution, saying in a tweet that the U.S. \u201cneeds strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.\u201d\n\nAt LAX, Witwit\u2019s family waited in fear, unable to contact her and unsure what would happen. Her children cried. Her husband worried that his wife would not be able to take the medication she needs for her advanced-stage breast cancer.\n\nWitwit, 48, wondered whether she would be reunited with her children again.\n\n\u201cI felt confused,\u201d she said. \u201cI fear that I will not see my family or my kids.\u201d\n\nWitwit and her husband, Isam Zabiba, recounted their six-hour ordeal Monday at their Westminster apartment, where the couple and their children moved from Iraq a little more than a year ago. Witwit, a gynecologist, and her husband, a college professor, are applying for green cards, but came to the United States with refugee status. Zabiba said they received that status after fleeing a \u201cbad situation\u201d in Iraq, where he worked with the U.S. Army helping Iraqis find jobs.\n\nThe couple said they were shocked that Witwit was detained for so long, noting that she had both her passport and legal travel documents allowing her to travel to and from the United States. Zabiba knew about Trump\u2019s travel ban, but said he thought a ruling from a judge in New York would allow his wife to come home without being affected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to new futures for us and for our children,\u201d Zabiba said. \u201cWe hope that this situation \u2026 is just bad dreams for just one night, not for all.\u201d\n\nFor days, Trump\u2019s move stirred chaos across the globe, with travelers abruptly intercepted en route to the United States and barred from entering the country. In the U.S., protesters swarmed outside airports as attorneys inside frantically worked on behalf of the detainees.\n\nAttorney Sireen Sawaf spent most of Sunday at LAX, trying to help a woman whose trip to the U.S. stalled in Saudi Arabia. Sawaf was about to go home that night, she said, when she saw two little girls and their father. The family was \u201cclearly waiting for someone,\u201d Sawaf recalled.\n\nSawaf, the daughter of Syrian immigrants who works at the L.A. city attorney\u2019s office, spoke to the family in Arabic and learned they were waiting for the girls\u2019 mother: Witwit. When Sawaf learned that Witwit was being treated for Stage 4 cancer, she said, she knew she had to stay.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk away,\u201d Sawaf said.\n\nAn immigration attorney began reaching out to Customs and Border Protection officials, Sawaf said, explaining that a cancer patient was being detained. Sawaf tried to amp up the pressure on social media, writing on Facebook about the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Witwit was still inside the room. Officials there didn\u2019t reveal much, she said. Someone told her she was being detained because she was from Iraq.\n\n\u201cBecause of Trump,\u201d the man told her. \u201cHe signed a paper.\u201d\n\nOfficials offered Witwit water and a chance to use the restroom, she and her husband said, but she wasn\u2019t able to take her medication, which she had packed in a checked bag that she didn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWitwit\u2019s family is still not sure why she was let go \u2014 the officers didn\u2019t clearly explain, they said. As soon as she left the room, Witwit said, her voice breaking, she went straight to her children and hugged them.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
