It led to a public showdown between Trump and the acting U.S. attorney general, who was fired late Monday after she challenged the constitutionality of the order.\n\nMcAleenan said it was fair to say that communication among government agencies on the order had \"not been the best.\"\n\nBut he said the refugees waivers were being done in concert with the State Department. He said those 872 refugees will be arriving this week and will be processed for waivers through the end of the week.\n\nAt the briefing, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly denied reports that he had been out of the loop in the White House planning for the immigration restrictions.\n\nKelly told reporters he looked at two drafts of the order before the Friday signing and that high-level government lawyers and agency officials were involved in drafting it. He also said he knew it was coming because Trump had long talked about it as a presidential candidate.\n\nPeople who know Kelly, however, told The Associated Press that he was not aware of the details in the directive until around the time that Trump signed it.\n\nTrump's order pauses America's entire refugee program for four months, indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria and temporarily freezes immigration from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
