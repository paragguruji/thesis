But their ultimate goal is far broader.\n\nTrump\u2019s top advisors on immigration, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller , see themselves as launching a radical experiment to fundamentally transform how the U.S. decides who is allowed into the country and to block a generation of people who, in their view, won\u2019t assimilate into American society.\n\nThat project may live or die in the next three months, as the Trump administration reviews whether and how to expand the visa ban and alter vetting procedures. White House aides are considering new, onerous security checks that could effectively limit travel into the U.S. by people from majority-Muslim countries to a trickle.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
