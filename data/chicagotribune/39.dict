The carrier and several other airlines have been pushing the U.S. to \u201cprivatize\u201d the air traffic control system.\n\nAnd Trump appeared intrigued by what Kelly described as the \u201csingle biggest opportunity for aviation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear we\u2019re spending billions and billions of dollars, and it\u2019s a system that\u2019s totally out of whack,\u201d Trump said at a listening session with several leaders in the airline industry.\n\nThe discussion came as part of what appeared to be a far-reaching conversation about overhauling the Federal Aviation Administration and other parts of air travel. Kelly, speaking to reporters after the hour-long session, said the meeting was \u201cdelightful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very well-aligned on some very key topics: income tax reform, regulatory reform and especially growing our industry,\u201d he said.\n\nThe confab marked one of the White House\u2019s first major forays into the business of the world\u2019s skies. It\u2019s one of several gatherings that Trump has hosted with business leaders in the early days of his administration.\n\nIn meeting with Trump, the airline executives sat down with a man who was once one of their own. The billionaire mogul, though far better known for his real estate deals, owned the less-than-successful Trump Airlines from 1989 to 1992.\n\nTrump has poked at the industry in recent weeks, blaming chaos that stemmed from his contentious travel ban on a Delta computer outage. But Trump singled out that airline for praise, saying Thursday that \u201cDelta\u2019s doing well.\u201d\n\nHe went even further in congratulating all of the airlines on succeeding \u201cdespite the bad equipment that the airport gives you, in many cases.\u201d To that end, he lamented that the U.S. has an \u201cobsolete\u201d plane system and airports.\n\n\u201cWe want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the other officials participating in the event were Delta Air Lines chief executive Ed Bastian, United Airlines chief executive Oscar Munoz, Alaska Airlines chief executive Brad Tilden, JetBlue Airways chief executive Robin Hayes and FedEx president Dave Bronczek.\n\nMissing from the bunch was Doug Parker, chief executive of Fort Worth-based American Airlines.\n\nParker stood out among Texas executives during the White House race in that he and other American brass backed Hillary Clinton. But a company spokesman said the White House absence stemmed from a conflict with a long-planned employee leadership conference in Dallas.\n\n\u201cDoug shares President Trump\u2019s commitment to modernizing our nation\u2019s infrastructure and looks forward to working with his administration to ensure all Americans have access to safe and efficient air travel,\u201d American spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday.\n\nAt the meeting, Southwest\u2019s Kelly steered the conversation from the get-go to the country\u2019s aging air traffic control system.\n\nThough the U.S. has spent huge sums on a NextGen program to update the system with satellite-based technology, the effort has been plagued by delays, funding problems and other issues. And Trump made clear that he\u2019s familiar with those concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way over budget. It\u2019s way behind schedule. And when it\u2019s completed, it\u2019s not going to be a good system,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\nKelly, seated directly across from Trump, pitched the president on the idea of creating a nonprofit group to handle air traffic control. Trump didn\u2019t rule anything out, though he appeared more interested in making the case that the FAA should be run by a pilot.\n\n\u201cI just think a non-pilot wouldn\u2019t know the sophistication of the system,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also hedged his bets \u2014 at least in the part of the meeting viewed by reporters \u2014 on one appeal from the airline industry that has obvious ties to the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach.\n\nAmerican, Delta and United have long cried foul over their charge that three state-owned airlines in the Middle East have used large government subsidies to boost their expansion into the U.S. That would distort the market, putting U.S. carriers at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nBut the Gulf carriers \u2014 Emirates, Etihad and Qatar \u2014 have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Some U.S. carriers, such as JetBlue and Hawaiian Airlines, haven\u2019t joined in the fight. And the Obama administration never took action on the issue.\n\nTrump told the executives Thursday that he knows they are \u201cunder pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers.\u201d But he was quick to add that \u201cat the same time, we want to make life good for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times, they come with big investments,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many cases, those investments are made by their governments. But they are still big investments.\u201d\n\nDallas Morning News staff writer Conor Shine in Dallas contributed to this report.\n\nDallas Morning News | Tribune News Service\n\n", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Tom Benning", "type": "article"}
