Yates by name or refer to her scheduled testimony on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to criticize the scope and nature of investigations into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election \u2014 on the eve of a much-anticipated Senate hearing that is to feature the testimony of an Obama-era U.S. deputy attorney general whom the president fired.\n\nYates, serving at the time as acting attorney general, was fired by Trump at the end of January for refusing to defend his travel ban in court, where it remains under legal challenge. She expected to be questioned by senators about her warnings to the White House in January regarding the then-national security advisor, Michael Flynn.\n\nFlynn was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. However, nearly three weeks elapsed between Yates\u2019 caution that Flynn could have left himself vulnerable to Russian blackmail by making untrue statements and his eventual firing.\n\nAnd Flynn\u2019s dismissal came only after the Washington Post reported that he had misled Pence about what was discussed in his phone calls with the Russian envoy.\n\nTrump has previously sought to deflect attention from possible ties between Moscow and his campaign, most notably in March, when he accused former President Obama of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d at Trump Tower. Intelligence officials and congressional investigators have said there is no evidence to support that claim.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-02", "authors": "Laura King", "type": "article"}
