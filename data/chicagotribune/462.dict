But the island state quickly became the focus of Trump supporters\u2019 ire and the travel ban.\n\nRelated: Is Trump's travel ban really about Muslims or not?\n\nThe hashtag #BoycottHawaii took off on Twitter on Thursday morning after several people said they would no longer travel to the island state in the Pacific Ocean, a popular vacationing destination for many Americans.\n\nHelping the hashtag flourish as a trending topic? Others who dismissed the attempt to boycott Hawaii.\n\nThe hashtag, of course, attracted some politicians, too. The Twitter account for the Tennessee GOP said, fine, let Hawaii take all the refugees. California Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Los Angeles, predicted Trump supporters would then boycott the state of Maryland where a second judge issued a similar ruling blocking the ban.\n\nWhile touring Tennessee on Wednesday, Trump offered his reaction to the travel ban block to a rally crowd gathered in Nashville. He said the \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of the travel ban should have never been blocked and that federal judges are overstepping their authority. The new ban follows an earlier executive order from Trump that was blocked by federal courts in early February\n\n\u201cThis is the opinion of many: An unprecedented judicial overreach,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna fight this terrible ruling. We\u2019re going to take our case as far as it needs to go including all the way up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nHave some thoughts to share?\n\nJoin me in a conversation: Shoot me a private email with your thoughts or ideas on a different approach to this story.
