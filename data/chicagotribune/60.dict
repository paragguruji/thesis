Nationally, the ACLU is one of several groups that filed lawsuits over Trump\u2019s previous executive orders, arguing a violation of constitutional protections against religious discrimination.\n\nFarhan Memon, chairperson of the Connecticut chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the new travel restrictions \u201chave very little to do with national security and everything to do with Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant bigotry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly suspect that the Trump administration banned North Koreans and Venezuelan government officials in a token and transparent attempt to escape allegations of anti-Muslim bigotry,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the new ban \u2014 which was outlined late Sunday as a necessary measure to keep the country safe \u2014 contains the same flaws as the prior iterations.\n\n\u201cIt imposes a mass ban or restriction without individualized judgment as to danger, which makes it problematic,\u201d he said.\n\nBlumenthal said there may be cause to strengthen immigration standards in the name of national security, but not through a travel ban. He proposed revising the visa waiver program he described as \u201criddled with gaps and faults\u201d and more rigorous investigation of people who come to the country on valid visas but overstay.\n\nUnlike the prior executive orders, the new travel restrictions won\u2019t apply to refugees, a relief to refugee settlement agencies in Connecticut. But those groups are anxious for another reason: They are still waiting to hear how many refugees the U.S. plans to accept for the new fiscal year that begins Sunday, a decision the president has the sole discretion to make.\n\nChris George, executive director of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services in New Haven, said President Barack Obama announced a goal of accepting 110,000 refugees in the current fiscal year, but that number was reduced to about 50,000 by Trump in the first months of his presidency.\n\nAs a result, IRIS saw its admissions decline from 530 to under 300. Statewide, George estimated refugee admissions in Connecticut dropped from more than 1,000 to under 600.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing rumors that the number will be 50,000 or fewer,\u201d George said. \u201cFifty thousand is already shamefully low given we are facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II, and if the number is lower than 50,000 then it\u2019ll be shocking and just totally unacceptable and there needs to be pushback from the public and Congress.\u201d\n\nGeorge said his agency has been plenty busy serving the refugees who have already arrived as well as resettling the smaller number that came this year, but if admissions remain low for much longer, IRIS may have to cut costs.\n\nClaudia Connor, president and CEO of the newly renamed Connecticut Institute for Refugees and Immigrants, said a major concern is that the new travel restrictions are indefinite and not in effect for a specific number of days like the prior versions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely disheartening to see this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that there is a balance that\u2019s struck between allowing people who meet appropriate levels of security to come into the country rather than closing down opportunities for people from particular countries based on the fact that they\u2019re from that country.\u201d\n\nRead The Courant's Capitol Watch blog \u00bb\n\nCAPTION Ariella Botts, 5, of East Hartford, was born with a severe muscular disorder called nemaline myopathy that requires round the clock care from a visiting nurse.
