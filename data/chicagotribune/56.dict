{"title": "'House of Cards' Season 5 speaks to Trump's America for better and worse", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-house-of-cards-season-5-review-20170530-story.html", "text": "Donald Trump might just be the end of Frank Underwood.\n\nThat\u2019s the thought I kept having as I watched the 13 episodes of Season 5 of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nThere is no way the new season that arrives Tuesday on Netflix can be discussed without reference to Trump, who was elected in November while Season 5 was still in production in Baltimore. That inescapable connection to the man in the real White House is both a good and potentially bad thing for the series.\n\nOn the plus side, there is genuine pleasure in watching the series dramatically explore bits and pieces of the nation\u2019s new Trumpian reality. It\u2019s wicked but ultimately safe fun to see Underwood (Kevin Spacey) embracing his inner autocrat at the very time the real president is doing the same with travel bans, threats against the press and an avalanche of executive orders.\n\nBut the greater pleasure for me during the first four seasons was in witnessing Underwood\u2019s shocking acts of transgression. And after Trump, they just don\u2019t seem so shocking anymore. That\u2019s the downside for \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nUnderwood spitting in the face of a near-life-size Christ on a crucifix in Season 3 was appalling. But what Trump said on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape about grabbing women is pretty appalling, too. My biggest disappointment in Season 5: Nothing Underwood did made me gasp \u2013 or even sit up straight in my chair and wonder if I had really seen what I thought I did. There is nothing in this season that rivals Underwood opening Season 3 by urinating on his father\u2019s grave.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily the fault of the series or the result of showrunner Beau Willimon\u2019s departure at the end of Season 4. I am more inclined to believe the change is in me \u2013 maybe in us as a culture \u2013 in the wake of Trump. Or maybe the shock factor for the series has simply maxed out.\n\nThere is still a lot to like about this series. The new showrunners, Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese, get all the forces of danger, darkness, treachery and chaos swirling in and around the White House of Frank and Claire Underwood, and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is still an outstanding political thriller.\n\nEpisode 1 mines the Trump vibe heavily. Underwood wants to formally declare war on the terrorist organization ICO (Islamic Caliphate Organization), protocol and constitutional separation of powers be damned. A young American who was radicalized in Pakistan beheaded a man on U.S. soil, and the Underwoods are trying to exploit it in their 2016 presidential campaign against New York\u2019s Republican governor, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman).\n\nAs president and candidate for re-election, Underwood is full of talk about closing borders and ending visas from certain countries. As he heightens the fear quotient, he simultaneously projects himself in the media as the strong father who can protect the nation \u2013 the only political leader who can do so.\n\nThe echoes of Trump\u2019s dystopian speech at the GOP Convention last summer are unmistakable.\n\n\u201cI am your voice ... I alone can fix it ... I will restore law and order,\u201d Trump told cheering delegates in one of his most baldly autocratic moments in the campaign. That\u2019s the wave Underwood is trying to surf in the first hour of Season 5.\n\nAnd just in case anyone is not making the connection to Trump\u2019s America, by the fifth episode, crowds are standing outside the White House gates with signs saying, \u201cNot My President.\u201d In the 12th episode, Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) says, \u201cIf it sounds like a fact, then it is fact.\u201d Not exactly presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway with her \u201calternative facts,\u201d but close enough. My favorite quote from Episode 12: \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable to assume that the FBI would involve itself in an election.\u201d\n\nAs vice president, Claire Underwood is peddling the same fear and supposedly soothing promise of her and her husband as America\u2019s parents. The series opens on her cutting a TV commercial in which she urges Americans to essentially spy on their neighbors and trust the Underwoods to keep them safe.\n\nYes, the Underwoods are pushing paranoia, too, straight out of Joe McCarthy\u2019s 1950s Cold War mindset \u2013 and Team Trump today. Enemies are everywhere, from terrorists to hackers to what Claire Underwood calls the \u201cnoisy press.\u201d\n\nGovernor Conway, though, has youth, optimism, a record as war hero and the backing of a social media executive with deep pockets.\n\nNo problem. War heroes have been swift-boated before in American politics. And with the threat of a terrorist attack on the front burner of American consciousness, the president has all sorts of weapons he can use to try to suppress votes in some places and even suspend voting in others \u2013 especially in swing states.\n\nGibson and Pugliese keep the dramatic pot boiling.\n\nAdding to the tension this season is the addition of Patricia Clarkson as Jane Davis, a Washington insider who seems to have phenomenal connections and inside knowledge on all things Russian. Clarkson is a superb actress, and she plays her character on a razor\u2019s edge so that you can never truly get a fix on her as friend or foe to the Underwoods.\n\nThis might be the best supporting performance of the year. Clarkson presents her character outwardly as a helpful, feminist aide to Claire, even as she sends subtle signals to the audience that she is capable of a treachery as great as that of the Underwoods. She gives you the creeps, but you cannot take your eyes off her when she is onscreen.\n\nThe dramatic noose is further tightened by sins of the past biting harder at the Underwoods\u2019 heels. Leading this pack is Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver), of the Washington Herald, doggedly investigating the death of his former reporter, Zoe Barnes, and the disappearance of Rachel Posner.\n\nI have a hard time buying Hammerschmidt as a featured analyst on CNN this season, even though I love the Zoe Barnes story line.\n\nIn a delicious life-intersects-art moment, on the morning after the second season premiered, someone scrawled, \u201cZoe doesn\u2019t live here any more,\u201d on a wall of the downtown building that housed her fictional apartment in Baltimore. That\u2019s how passionately some fans reacted to the moment of her death in the series.\n\nI almost dropped dead from shock when Frank pushed her under that subway train, but nothing matches it on the gasp-o-meter in Season 5.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-30", "authors": "David Zurawik", "type": "article"}
