Since the rules only affect visa applications, the Department of Homeland Security issued no new instructions to Customs and Border Patrol on Thursday.\n\nThat absence of guidance was a cause of concern for some advocates and lawyers who volunteer for the Travelers Assistance Project, the website where people heading to Chicago can register their itineraries in case they need legal assistance when they land.\n\nThe project formally launched after about 150 attorneys rushed to O'Hare the day after the first travel ban went into effect and stayed through the weekend to help secure the release of more than a dozen travelers \u2014 all of whom had some kind of legal status in the U.S.\n\nAt least two lawyers will be stationed at O'Hare's international terminal through the holiday weekend, said Matt Pryor, co-leader of the project.\n\n\"It's not going to change anything on the border, but we'll see if that comes through,\" Pryor said. \"Obviously there was no guidance given to them at the first order and that's why the chaos occurred.\"\n\nIf travelers are not formally detained but just held for questioning, lawyers are barred from speaking with them. The mission for volunteers this weekend will be to interview family members to find out if a second visa interview is being conducted unnecessarily before they can enter the U.S.\n\nAhmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, said lawyers also will be looking for examples of travelers turned away because their bona fide relationship does not fit into the administration's narrow definition. Those will be opportunities for litigation, he said.\n\nSufyan Sohel, deputy director and legal counsel for CAIR-Chicago, said several dozen travelers from the six countries as well as Pakistan, India and some European countries registered for assistance before traveling to the U.S. this weekend.\n\n\"We're encouraging them to bring all the documents that show you have every intent of going back home and you're not using your visitor visa for immigration purposes,\" Sohel said. He added that some of the people who register are often citizens or legal permanent residents. \"It shows these actions are really instilling fear in these communities.\"\n\nTalabay, of Woodstock, graduated from John Marshall Law School about two weeks ago, and after protesting the travel ban in January now was ready to offer legal assistance to travelers.\n\n\"Our country has been a beacon of freedom since our founding fathers and before,\" Talabay said.\n\nmbrachear@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @TribSeeker\n\ntbriscoe@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @_TonyBriscoe", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "authors": "Manya Brachear Pashman, Tony Briscoe", "type": "article"}
