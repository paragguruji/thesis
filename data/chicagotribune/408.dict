But their ultimate goal is far broader.\n\nTrump\u2019s top advisors on immigration, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior advisor Stephen Miller, see themselves as launching a radical experiment to fundamentally transform how the U.S. decides who is allowed into the country and to block a generation of people who, in their view, won\u2019t assimilate into American society.\n\nThat project may live or die in the next three months, as the Trump administration reviews whether and how to expand the visa ban and alter vetting procedures. White House aides are considering new, onerous security checks that could effectively limit travel into the U.S. by people from majority-Muslim countries to a trickle.\n\nThe administration faced down another torrent of criticism Monday \u2014 from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, career diplomats, national security experts and world leaders \u2014 over the hasty rollout of the order, as well as the message it sent to both friends and adversaries in the war on terrorism. Though Trump\u2019s ban does not affect all Muslims, as he promised during the campaign, many see it as religiously targeted.\n\nPresident Obama also weighed in for the first time, saying through a spokesman that he \"is heartened\" by the public demonstrations against it. Obama did not cite specific language from the order, but spokesman Kevin Lewis said Obama \"fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\"\n\nThe government bureaucracy also began a swift and startling level of resistance to the new president\u2019s initiative, punctuated by a letter from acting U.S. Atty. Gen. Sally Yates, who declared that she would refuse to defend the order in court against a series of lawsuits.\n\nTrump immediately counterpunched, firing Yates within hours Monday night and replacing her with Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern district of Virginia, on an acting basis.\n\nA group of U.S. diplomats circulated an internal memo through a State Department process that allows them to privately express dissent, arguing that Trump\u2019s order \u201cruns counter to core American values of non-discrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants.\n\n\"A policy which closes our doors to over 200-million legitimate travelers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travelers who intend to harm Americans ... will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,\" said a draft version of the memo.\n\nThe Pentagon, with written support from Republican military veterans serving in Congress, began compiling a list of Iraqi citizens who have worked with the armed forces and is recommending that they be exempt from Trump\u2019s temporary ban on entry to the U.S. by people from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. The move could potentially shield tens of thousands of Iraqi interpreters, advisors, and others who have assisted the U.S. military from the president\u2019s controversial action.\n\nThe list will include names of individuals who have \u201cdemonstrated their commitment\u201d to helping the U.S., Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday.\n\n\u201cEven people that are doing seemingly benign things in support of us \u2014 whether as a linguist, a driver, anything else \u2014 they often do that at great personal risk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people who take these risks are really making a tangible signal of support to the United States, and that\u2019s something that will, and should be, recognized.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration recognizes the help of Iraqi interpreters and others who have served this country, but added that they would remain subject to intense vetting.\n\n\u201cWe should make sure that in those cases they're helped out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass.\u201d\n\nDespite the backlash, senior White House officials maintain that the ban is popular with Trump\u2019s voters, though no reputable polling on the question has been released since Friday\u2019s order. Spicer said media coverage of the implementation had been overblown, given that only 109 of 325,000 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours. He said Trump is putting in place proactive security measures rather than reacting to attacks.\n\n\u201cI'm sorry that some folks may have had to wait a little while, but I think the president would much rather know that he's not placing a call to someone who was killed because someone was let into this country to commit a terrorist act,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the countries of origin for perpetrators of several prominent attacks cited by Spicer were not on the list of banned countries. Spicer and other administration officials said more countries could be added.\n\nSpicer had little sympathy for dissenting diplomats, saying their disagreement with the policy calls \u201cinto question whether or not they should continue in that post or not.\u201d\n\nYet they were hardly the only ones voicing concern. Phone lines throughout the Capitol were jammed with constituents asking questions and raising concerns over the order.\n\nWhite House aides fought back against characterizations that they had kept the order to themselves, pointing to input they had gotten for months from allies.\n\nSenior GOP staff on the House and Senate judiciary committees helped write a version of the executive order on their own time during Trump\u2019s transition.\n\nThey based its legal wording on the harsh immigration policy Trump laid out on the campaign trail. During a speech in Phoenix in August, Trump promised to suspend immigration from \u201cplaces like Syria and Libya\u201d and create an \u201cideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Brian Bennett, Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
