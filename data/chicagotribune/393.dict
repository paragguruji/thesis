U.S. District Judge James Robart told the federal government to quickly respond to Ferguson's claims but said he would not hold a hearing before Wednesday.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced the most populous U.S. state was joining Washington state's challenge, saying the order, despite its changes, is an attack on people based on their religion or national origin.\n\nIn Hawaii, which is alone in its lawsuit, the U.S. government asked a federal court Monday to deny the state's request to temporarily block the ban from going into effect.\n\nA judge will hear arguments Wednesday, with the heavily Democratic state claiming the new order will harm its Muslim population, tourism and foreign students. Ismail Elshikh, a plaintiff in Hawaii's challenge, said the ban will prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting.\n\nThe government says Hawaii's allegations that the ban will negatively affect tourism and universities are pure speculation. It also says neither Elshikh nor his mother-in-law have been harmed because she has not been denied a waiver for a visa to visit the United States.\n\nTrump's revised ban applies to Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program. Unlike the original order, it says people with visas won't be affected and removes language that would give priority to religious minorities.\n\nFerguson acknowledged the changes to the order but said it still \"bars entry for virtually all other individuals from the listed countries,\" including relatives of U.S. citizens and students who have been admitted to state universities and people who might seek work at schools and businesses.\n\n\"This court's original injunction protected these individuals and institutions,\" Washington state's new court filing said.\n\nIt said the federal government can't enforce the new travel ban unless it asks Judge Robart to modify his original restraining order.\n\n\"Until they do so, they cannot escape the injunction and continue their illegal conduct,\" the filing said.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that the administration believes the revised travel ban will stand up to legal scrutiny.\n\nAssociated Press writers Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-13", "authors": "Chris Grygiel", "type": "article"}
