It was the first U.S. attack on Syrian forces in the six-year civil war.\n\nRussia continues to deny that Assad\u2019s forces carried out the April 4 gas attack and Peskov criticized the White House for saying there were signs of preparation for \u201canother\u201d such strike.\n\nPeskov said the Kremlin does not \u201cthink it is possible to lay the blame on the Syrian armed forces\u201d for the April strike on the village of Khan Sheikhoun, which the U.S. and its allies said involved sarin, a banned nerve agent.\n\n\"Despite all the demands from the Russian side, an impartial international inquiry into a previous tragedy using chemical agents has not been carried out,\u201d the spokesman told Russian news agencies.\n\nPeskov criticized the White House warning to Assad, saying \u201csuch threats to Syria\u2019s legitimate leaders are unacceptable.\u201d", "source": "latimes.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-27", "authors": "Sabra Ayres", "type": "article"}
