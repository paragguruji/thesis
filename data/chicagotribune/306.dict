The White House has forecast smoother sailing the second time around. White House press secretary Sean Spicer predicted last week \"it will be implemented flawlessly\" because of the due diligence of officials.\n\nBut no matter what the new policy says, lawsuits challenging its aims are expected.\n\nQuestions and answers about the path ahead:\n\nAndres Kudacki / AP People carry posters during a rally against President Donald Trump's executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, in New York's Times Square.

But the president and the White House press secretary have also recently said that they intend to fight for the merits of the original order in court, even as they draft a replacement.\n\nOn Monday, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request from the Justice Department to put Trump's travel ban case on hold until he issues a new order.\n\nThe new order could go into effect immediately and would not be blocked by the court ruling that has kept the existing order on hold, said David Levine, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. Levine said new regulations and laws are assumed to be legal until a court says otherwise. \"It's valid unless it's invalid,\" Levine said.\n\nCAN WE EXPECT COURT CHALLENGES TO THE NEW ORDER?\n\nYes.\n\nFour officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the new order will remove Iraq from the list of countries facing a temporary U.S. travel ban. Citing the latest draft in circulation, they said the document also no longer singles out Syrian refugees for an indefinite ban and instead includes them in a general, 120-day suspension of new refugee admissions.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the order before it is signed.\n\nThere are likely to be various, other technical changes to try to head off any attempt by Washington state and Minnesota, the two states whose lawsuit led to a court order that halted the order, from moving quickly for a court order putting any new ban on hold.\n\nIn refusing last month to reinstate the travel ban, which a judge in Washington state had blocked from taking effect, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals identified \"significant constitutional questions\" with the administration's plan to temporarily suspend the refugee program and to halt immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nThe new order maintains the ban for the other six countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a \"bulletproof\" order that could assuage the concerns of the immigrant rights community and other potential challengers, said Jon Michaels, a UCLA law professor.\n\n\"My sense is, there will be challenges, and challenges will be, at the very least, plausible challenges,\" Michaels said.\n\nA repeat of the chaos that the original order sparked is possible, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \"It will surely be a mess,\" he said. But the administration insists that won't be the case.\n\nSpicer said last week the administration has \"sought feedback and guidance and done this in an unbelievably comprehensive way\" to make sure the agencies implementing the new order know what's happening.\n\nHe said the administration is expecting potential new court challenges, but suggests the White House will be better prepared.\n\nTed S.

Warren / AP)\n\nWILL THE NEW ONE PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER?\n\nThat's hard to say.\n\nThe 9th Circuit decision, for instance, said the first order may have violated the constitutional rights of green-card holders to notice and a hearing before their travel was restricted. Any new policy may have to address that concern to be viable.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that a ban that exempts green-card holders and focuses only on foreigners from the seven nations who have never entered the U.S. would be entirely legal. But the court said Washington state and Minnesota might have a valid claim that even some of those foreigners have a constitutional right to challenge the ban.\n\nForeigners outside the United States have, at best, limited rights to sue in U.S. courts.\n\nA narrowly tailored ban that focused on foreigners from the listed countries who have never entered the U.S. would also not do away with the states' concern that the administration is illegally targeting people on the basis of religion. The First Amendment's establishment clause bars discrimination on the basis of religion.\n\nTo beat the religious discrimination argument, the government may also have to overcome statements outside of court by Trump and aides, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Challengers of the ban have held those statements up as evidence of discriminatory intent.\n\nThe statements include Giuliani's claim that Trump had asked him how to legally pull off a \"Muslim ban,\" and Trump's own interview statements that Christian refugees had been disadvantaged. The 9th Circuit did not fully address the issue, but did note that courts assessing the motive of a government action can take into account statements by decision-makers.\n\nThose statements hinting at intent may prove hard to dispose of even if the policy changes, said Chris Edelson, an expert on presidential power at American University in Washington, D.C.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "authors": "Eric Tucker, Sudhin Thanawala", "type": "article"}
