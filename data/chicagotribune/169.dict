Referring to his orders to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects, Trump recalled last month that he interrupted the signing to ask, \u201cWho makes those beautiful pipes for the pipeline?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, they\u2019re made outside of this country,\u201d came the response.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No more, no more.\u2019 So we added a little clause \u2014 didn\u2019t take much \u2014 that [if] you want to build pipelines in this country, you\u2019re going to buy your steel, and you\u2019re going to have it fabricated, here. Makes sense, right?\u201d\n\nThe story has proved effective with Trump\u2019s audiences, but it\u2019s not an accurate description of what he did. It took the White House only a couple of weeks after the signing to acknowledge that the \u201cBuy America\u201d rule would not apply to Keystone. That would be unfair, officials said, because TransCanada, the company building the line, had long ago bought its pipe, some of it made in the U.S., and the rest in Canada, Italy and India.\n\nEven so, White House officials have insisted that all future pipelines will be covered.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, either, according to government documents and interviews with officials in the affected industries.\n\nThe actual number of pipelines covered by Trump\u2019s Buy America rule could well be zero.\n\nRushing things through is risky. You can end up looking like you\u2019re not competent. \u2014 John Hudak, Center for Effective Public Management, Brookings Institution\n\nTherein lies a tale about the gap between the president\u2019s sometimes extravagant promises and the reality of his governing. White House officials, when asked about the discrepancy, sought to explain it away by redefining Trump\u2019s words \u2014 a practice they've often followed over the last three months.\n\nTrump revels in executive orders. With his legislative program either stymied \u2014 as in the case of healthcare \u2014 or far behind schedule, Trump has used orders he can sign in front of TV cameras to provide images of decisive action.\n\nBut a review by The Times of the 39 orders and presidential memorandums signed by Trump found that fewer than half actually made a substantive change in federal policy. Sixteen of the directives simply told Cabinet agencies to study a problem and come up with recommendations \u2014 something that in many cases the agencies had the authority to do even without a formal order.\n\nOf the executive orders that actually did change policy, two \u2014 the original and revised versions of Trump\u2019s ban on travel to the U.S. by residents of several majority-Muslim countries \u2014 have been blocked by courts. Another was a freeze on hiring by federal departments, which the White House rescinded last week after it was blamed for worsening backlogs at Veterans hospitals and Social Security offices. And an order from January, reorganizing the National Security Council to add Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon, was negated by another earlier this month that took Bannon off the panel.\n\nThat leaves about a dozen orders that have truly succeeded in changing policy. Most involve rolling back Obama administration environmental policies or toughening immigration enforcement \u2014 two priorities on which the administration has focused sustained attention.\n\nA number of Trump\u2019s early executive actions were \u201cnot well thought-through,\u201d said John Hudak, deputy director at the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Many of them \u201cwere quite rushed. The president was trying to achieve fairly dramatic public policy change too quickly\u201d \u2014 as with the travel ban. \u201cRushing things through is risky,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can end up looking like you\u2019re not competent.\u201d\n\nThe directive on using American steel in pipelines illustrates a second risk \u2014 actions that don\u2019t match the claims that surround them. Although Trump likes to say that he inserted a \u201clittle clause\u201d that put the Buy America requirement into force, the Jan. 24 presidential memorandum does not do that. Instead, it set a broad policy of favoring domestic steel and told the Commerce Department to take six months to come up with a plan to put the requirement into effect \u201cto the extent permitted by law.\u201d\n\nThat language largely negates what Trump claims: Current law almost certainly does not allow the government to impose a domestic-content rule on private companies.\n\nThe government \u201clacks statutory authority\u201d to tell a private-sector company, building a project financed by private funds, where to buy from, Jeffrey Shoaf, director of government affairs at Associated General Contractors, wrote to Commerce officials in response to their request for public comment on Trump\u2019s plan. The association represents companies that build major projects.\n\nPipelines in the U.S. are almost all funded by private-sector money, not tax funds. They do need federal and state permits before they can be built, but those cover specific purposes, such as guarding U.S. waterways from pollution or protecting endangered species. Grafting a Buy America rule onto permits would be a \u201cvery dangerous, slippery slope that opens the door to all sorts of federal requirements that have never before been conditions on privately funded construction work,\u201d Shoaf wrote.\n\nIn interviews, lawyers for pipeline companies took the same position, declining to speak on the record because their clients want to maintain friendly relations with a White House that is actively supporting most of the oil and gas industry\u2019s agenda.\n\nAt the Commerce Department, officials declined to comment when asked whether they had identified any legal basis for the requirement.\n\nThe department\u2019s public comment period ended earlier this month, and none of the 81 submissions filed by companies, trade associations and individuals suggested a legal way to enforce Trump\u2019s rule.\n\nWhite House officials, asked about the issue, offered a now-familiar explanation: The president\u2019s words shouldn\u2019t be given their literal meaning. While Trump has repeatedly talked about the Buy America policy as a mandatory rule, the officials cast it as an exhortation.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-16", "authors": "David Lauter", "type": "article"}
