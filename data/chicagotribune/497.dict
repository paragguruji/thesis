Clifton of Honolulu, Hawaii, is a senior judge for the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He and two other judges were set to consider whether a temporary restraining order against Trump's executive order, issued Feb. 3 by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, should remain in effect, or be lifted, while a suit against the order goes forward.\n\nWhile he was a student at New Trier East, Clifton was the manager for WNTH, the school's radio station, and also took part in the school's student cabinet, its debate team and the school's Boys Honor Group, according to information from the school district. He was also a National Merit finalist.\n\nA 2016 press release from the office of the circuit executive of the 9th Circuit Court stated that Clifton was born in Massachusetts and grew up in Indianapolis and in Wilmette. He attended Princeton University, received his law degree from Yale University in 1975, and moved that year to Hawaii. He worked as an attorney in Honolulu until former President George W. Bush nominated him to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was approved by the Senate in 2002, according to the press release.\n\nkroutliffe@pioneerlocal.com\n\nTwitter @pioneer_kathy", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Kathy Routliffe", "type": "article"}
