The official comment came after May refused to condemn the ban during a visit to Turkey to meet with Turkish leaders. She said in Turkey the decision was a matter solely for the U.S.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also regrets the travel ban.\n\n\"She is convinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn't justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion,\" Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said.\n\nMerkel raised the issue during a phone call with Trump on Saturday, citing the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention that calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, Seibert said.\n\n\"The German government will now examine what consequences the U.S. government's measures have for German citizens with dual citizenship and, if necessary, represent their interests toward our American partners,\" he said.\n\nAn initial joint U.S.-German statement following the call made no mention of the topic of refugees or travel bans.\n\nAmong the first leaders to voice criticism was French President Francois Hollande, who said Saturday that \"when (Trump) rejects the arrival of refugees, while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, nationalist and far-right groups in Europe applauded the U.S. travel restrictions.\n\nEugene Garcia / EPA Rosalie Gurna, 9, joins hundreds of protesters denouncing the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries enacted by President Trump outside of the international terminal at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California on Jan. 28, 2017.

Hope you'll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\"\n\nWilders, whose Party for Freedom is polling strongly before the country's March 15 election, later tweeted: \"No more immigration from any Islamic country is exactly what we need. Also in The Netherlands. For Islam and freedom are incompatible.\"\n\nThe far-right National Democratic Party in Germany celebrated what it described as \"the massive restriction on the entry of pseudo-refugees and Muslims to the USA.\"\n\n\"For the first time ever one can say from a nationalist perspective: keep going, USA,\" the party wrote on its official Facebook page.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
