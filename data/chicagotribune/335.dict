In the face of numerous legal challenges, a federal court in Seattle blocked the implementation of the ban. That court's stay was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nTrump administration officials have promised to continue defending the original order in courts, even while the president is expected to sign a new order.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-04", "authors": "Abby Phillip and Robert Costa", "type": "article"}
