The world vacations in Orlando, and a quarter of a million of us work in \u201chospitality and leisure.\u201d So anything that affects foreign travel affects all of us.\n\nIn January, President Trump issued an executive order banning travel from seven Muslim countries. Almost immediately, the courts issued a \u201cstay\u201d against that order, on constitutional grounds.\n\nIn March, Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security prohibited anyone from carrying a laptop computer onto flights from eight Muslim countries. That order remains in effect.\n\nQuestion: Is it legal for the federal government to base its decisions on what country you are from?\n\nAnswer: We don\u2019t have a final ruling yet, but I strongly suspect that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d In fact, Businessman Donald Trump would never be able get away with the actions that President Donald Trump has taken, because the law flatly prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin \u2014 as it should.\n\nThe gist of Trump\u2019s argument in court is that it\u2019s often difficult to collect full background information on citizens of these Muslim countries (\u201cextreme vetting\u201d), and therefore to judge whether they might represent a threat to the United States.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, that\u2019s just not the way American law works. If you are genuinely concerned about letting people lacking background information into our country, then you try to bar people lacking background information, not the citizens of certain countries, or the adherents of certain religions, or whatever.\n\nFrankly, there probably is more background information regarding the average visa applicant from Syria than there is regarding the average applicant from Guinea, or New Guinea, or Equatorial Guinea, or Guinea-Bissau. There is a word for singling out the applicants of a particular country for exclusion on a basis that applies equally, or more greatly, to others. That word is \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the law requires us to concentrate on the thing that supposedly matters (background information), not the thing that reflects your own bias (national origin).\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of national origin has been explicitly illegal for more than a half-century, starting with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This is from the Department of Justice Manual:\n\n\u201cFederal laws prohibit discrimination based on a person's national origin, race, color, religion, disability, sex, and familial status. Laws prohibiting national origin discrimination make it illegal to discriminate because of a person's birthplace, ancestry, culture or language. This means people cannot be denied equal opportunity because they or their family are from another country, because they have a name or accent associated with a national origin group, because they participate in certain customs associated with a national origin group, or because they are married to or associate with people of a certain national origin.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice says that discrimination on the basis of national origin is prohibited in education, employment, housing, lending, public accommodations, law enforcement and voting, among other things.\n\nCould Donald Trump, luxury hotelier, turn away Syrian guests? No. In fact, according to the Department of Justice, Trump couldn\u2019t even make them wait longer at the check-in counter, charge them extra, or require them to pay in cash.\n\nCould Donald Trump, \u201cjob creator,\u201d refuse to hire Syrians? No. In fact, according to the Department of Justice, Trump couldn\u2019t turn down Syrian applicants because they speak with an accent, or even allow anyone else in the workplace to use a racist epithet. In fact, he couldn\u2019t even require proof of work authorization, unless he does that for all job applicants.\n\nSo Donald Trump, president, is trying to do something that Donald Trump, businessman, could never get away with. And that is true regardless of whether the motivation is prejudice against Muslims (which would be despicable) or not.\n\nHere at what Disney dubs \u201cthe happiest place on Earth,\u201d our doors are open to everyone who wants to have a good time \u2014 no matter what you look like, no matter whom you love, no matter where you\u2019re from, and no matter to whom you pray. That\u2019s the way it is, and that\u2019s the way it ought to be.\n\nAlan Grayson, a Democrat from Orlando, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "authors": "Alan Grayson", "type": "article"}
