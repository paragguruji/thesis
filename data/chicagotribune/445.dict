That doesn't work right now.\n\nAmerica the cruel, maybe. America the ugly.\n\nThose are better fits for the moment. Those are the slogans you get when your national agenda is driven by willful meanness, when it's oblivious to common sense.\n\nAmerica the cruel. That's what we were Tuesday when President Donald Trump decided to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shielded hundreds of thousands of young people brought to America illegally as children.\n\nIt was a decision as mean-spirited as it was unnecessary.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops called it \"reprehensible\" and wrote in a statement: \"Today's actions represent a heartbreaking moment in our history that shows the absence of mercy and goodwill, and a short-sighted vision for the future.\"\n\nThe United Methodist Church called rescinding the protections \"unconscionable\" and \"contrary to moral work and witness.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who started the program in 2012 after Congress failed to provide protection for these youths, released a statement Tuesday saying: \"Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we'd want our own kids to be treated. It's about who we are as a people \u2014 and who we want to be.\"\n\nMuch has happened over the past eight months to raise questions about who we, as Americans, want to be.\n\nEnding the DACA program and thrusting the lives of nearly 800,000 people raised in America into the clumsy hands of Congress, which Trump called on to fix the problem he's creating, is only the latest example of an administration that routinely picks cruelty over basic decency.\n\nRecall Trump's \"travel ban\" \u2014 a transparent attempt to keep Muslims out of the country \u2014 that got his presidency off to a bumbling, discriminatory start. The president claimed to have all manner of powers to enact such a ban, even though most experts correctly predicted it would get tied up in courts across the country and most Americans didn't want it to happen.\n\nThere was no legitimate security fix behind the travel ban. It was demeaning to Muslim people. It was faux-toughness aimed at reassuring Trump's quivering base. And that's all that mattered.\n\nThe border wall is isolationist, promoted by painting Mexican immigrants as criminals and Mexico itself as a hive of murder and villainy, prohibitively expensive and frowned on by a sizable majority of Americans.\n\nSo what's the point of that wall proposal? To rile up Trump's predominantly white base at the expense of immigrants. There's no positive outcome. It's an idea rooted in meanness. Period.\n\nTrump's ban on transgender people serving in the military? It wasn't anything the military wanted, and it's questionable whether the military will even enact the ban, it was opposed by a majority of Americans, and it is strikingly harmful to the brave transgender people serving in the armed forces and to the transgender community at large.\n\nWhat was the point? There was no point. It was a malicious decision aimed at pleasing a narrow segment of the population, a segment that clearly couldn't care less about the harm such discrimination might cause fellow Americans.\n\nTrump's response to the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., could so easily have been a moment of kindness. But he had to hedge. He had to suggest there were \"many fine people\" among the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan members. He couldn't keep his own ugliness at bay.\n\nIn announcing Trump's decision to wind down the DACA program, Attorney General Jeff Sessions hammered away at the importance of \"the rule of law.\"\n\n\"Societies where the rule of law is subject to political whims and personal biases tend to become societies afflicted by corruption, poverty and human suffering,\" he said.\n\nA little more than a week earlier, Trump felt fine overruling the rule of law by pardoning his avid supporter and good pal Joe Arpaio, a notorious and unapologetic Arizona sheriff who violated a federal court order to stop racially profiling Hispanic people.\n\nApparently the law is sacrosanct when it comes to booting brown people out of the country or keeping them from getting in, but there's wiggle room when your openly xenophobic white sheriff buddy is in hot water.\n\nPardoning Arpaio was a middle finger in the face of minority populations in general and Mexican immigrants in particular. And that was followed up by an announcement about DACA in which the attorney general reduced the nearly 800,000 young people the program protects \u2014 people with clean records, a high school or higher education, and little knowledge of any home outside America \u2014 to \"800,000 mostly adult illegal aliens.\"\n\nIf you line these decisions and declarations up, you see no higher purpose, just a clear pattern of callousness. And you notice that the only people spared in all that meanness are the ones who look like Donald Trump.\n\nThat's not the way things are supposed to work in America the beautiful.\n\nBut I guess it's the new normal in America the cruel.\n\nrhuppke@chicagotribune.com\n\nWhat to read next:\n\nPresident Trump's America is a nightmare.
