He refused to add clarity or context to Trump's Twitter missives, saying neither the president nor the White House would comment further until the congressional investigations are completed.\n\n\"I'm just going to let the tweet speak for itself,\" Spicer said. \"I think the president speaks very candidly.\"\n\nSpicer, citing news reports, said there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation at the congressional level.\n\n\"I think that there's no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap or whatever?\" Spicer said. \"But there's been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred.\"\n\nPresident Obama denied that he or his staff had authorized any such surveillance.

If there was a FISA wiretap of Trump during the campaign, it would mean that the court had found there was probable cause to believe he was acting as an \"agent of a foreign power,\" as the law requires.\n\nIn perhaps the clearest sign of the uncomfortable situation the president's tweets created for his aides, the normally media-hungry White House went largely dark Monday. Although several top officials did defend Trump in TV interviews, Spicer did not allow cameras into the briefing room for his news conference Monday, and Trump signed an executive order for his revamped travel ban in private.\n\nSpeaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Clapper did provide the White House with a bit of cover, saying there was \"no evidence\" of collusion between Trump and Russia during the campaign. But he also undercut the president's assertion that Obama had wiretapped him, saying, \"There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time as a candidate or against his campaign.\"\n\nSpicer urged reporters to note Clapper's comments about an apparent lack of collusion, but gave less weight to his remarks refuting Trump's claims of wiretapping. Asked about the difference, Spicer said, \"He said that he wasn't aware of anything. I take him at his word that he wasn't aware, but that doesn't mean that it didn't exist.\"\n\nThis reverse-engineering of evidence has happened before, as when the president declared erroneously that his inauguration crowd was the largest in history and when he claimed without evidence that at least 3 million undocumented immigrants illegally voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nThe public face of this latest effort has mostly been deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was dispatched to a Sunday news show - even though Spicer and chief of staff Reince Priebus usually take that task - and to two Monday morning talk shows.\n\nSanders admitted that she had not discussed the matter with the president, and she lacked answers to questions. When asked Monday by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos whether the president accepted that Comey had refuted his tweets, Sanders responded: \"You know, I don't think he does.\"\n\nLike Spicer, Sanders claimed Trump's accusations are supported by news media reports, even though a list of such articles provided by the White House contained no such evidence. She also attempted to recast the president's words with a softer tone.\n\n\"Look, the president firmly believes that the Obama administration may have tapped into the phones at Trump Tower,\" Sanders said on NBC's \"Today Show\" on Monday. \"This is something that we should look into. We'd like to know for sure.\"\n\nSanders repeatedly urged that the press and others give the president the same benefit of the doubt that they seemed to be giving to those accusing the Trump campaign of coordinating with the Russian government.\n\n\"Look,\" Sanders said on the \"Today Show,\" \"I haven't had the chance to have the conversation directly with the president, and he's at a much higher classification than I am, so he may have access to documents that I don't know about, but I do know that we take this very seriously.\"\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway followed a similar script Monday on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends,\" saying there have been numerous media reports that there was \"politically motivated activity all during the campaign and suggesting that there may be more there.\"\n\n\"He's the president of the United States,\" Conway said. \"He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not. And that's the way it should be for presidents.\"\n\nAt times, it seemed that even West Wing officials had not coordinated their responses with one another. Asked about Conway's comment Monday, Spicer said he hadn't talked with her about what she meant.\n\n\"I can't specifically respond to you in terms of what she was referring to, whether she was referring to the exact nature of this charge or whether generally speaking he is given information,\" Spicer said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Ashley Parker, Jenna Johnson", "type": "article"}
