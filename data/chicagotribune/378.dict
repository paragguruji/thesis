That order requires visa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees worldwide to prove a \u201cbona fide\u201d family relationship to the U.S.\n\nIn a court filing Monday responding to Hawaii\u2019s challenge, the government said its definition of \u201cclose family member\u201d is consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The INA \u201cframes the backdrop for federal immigration policy, including the executive order,\u201d according to the filing. \u201cEven some familial relationships\u201d won\u2019t suffice for visa applicants and refugees because of limits set by the INA that \u201cprivileges certain family relationships over others.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs attempt to create a dispute where there is none,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s brief.\n\nFederal Judge Derrick Watson is likely to rule after July 5 on Hawaii\u2019s request for clarity regarding family ties.\n\nHawaii\u2019s challenge is the latest in a dispute between Trump and ideological opponents of the administration\u2019s immigration agenda that\u2019s spanned all but the first 10 days of his presidency. The president scored a legal victory last week when the Supreme Court approved partial enforcement of a narrowed version of the ban.\n\nThe Supreme Court said it will hear the administration\u2019s appeal of lower-court orders blocking the ban from taking effect in its next nine-month session starting in October. In the meantime, it allowed the administration to enforce prohibition with some caveats, such as \u201cbona fide\u201d relationships.\n\nCritics are claiming the government overreached in its execution of the Supreme Court\u2019s order.\n\nCentral to the dispute is the question of who constitutes family for applicants seeking refuge or a visa to the U.S. The Supreme Court ruled that the travel ban could be applied for now to everyone except people with a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe government then went on to define \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d as links within a nuclear family, including spouses and children and siblings. That excluded aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and \u2014 initially \u2014 fiances. The administration also ruled out any connections between refugees and resettlement agencies, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe government quickly backed off on fiances. In a version of the new rules posted early June 29, fiances weren\u2019t among those deemed as having \u201cbona fide\u201d ties. But later in the day, without explanation, the State Department updated its guidance to say that fiances would be treated as close family members.\n\nThe travel restrictions allow Trump to declare partial victory on his campaign promise to stem the flow of refugees and travelers from nations he deems a security risk. Lower court decisions to block two of his proposed travel bans were early, public defeats for the administration.\n\nStill, the State Department\u2019s definition did nothing to assuage concerns that the impetus of the policy is Trump\u2019s discriminatory intent toward Muslims. The court in Hawaii and another in Maryland ruled that the travel ban is the manifestation of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to deliver a Muslim ban, a violation of First Amendment rights to religious freedom.\n\nNongovernmental organizations and refugee advocates have struggled to determine how many people will actually be affected by the revised restrictions. The U.S. has already admitted about 49,000 refugees this year, just shy of the executive order\u2019s 50,000 cap, which could be breached before Watson rules on Hawaii\u2019s motion.\n\nHawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin has asked Watson \u2014 the same judge who issued a preliminary injunction against the revised travel ban \u2014 to clarify the scope of the order claiming the latest restrictions go further than the Supreme Court allowed.\n\n\u201cAfter days of stonewalling plaintiffs\u2019 repeated requests for information, the government announced that it intended to violate the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction,\u201d Hawaii said in a filing last week in Honolulu federal court. \u201cIt will apply the executive order to exclude a host of aliens with a \u2018close familial relationship\u2019 to U.S. persons.\u201d\n\nChin said if the judge can\u2019t immediately provide clarification, the state wants an order barring the government from using the State Department\u2019s definition of family ties.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that when you read their definition of what constitutes a close family relationship, they\u2019re cutting out a lot of people,\u201d Chin said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-03", "authors": "Kartikay Mehrotra", "type": "article"}
