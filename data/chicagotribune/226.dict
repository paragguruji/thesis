Charlie Dent of Allentown and Brian Fitzpatrick of Bucks County both spoke out against the order. Democratic legislators from Pennsylvania also criticized the travel ban, including several who joined a protest Saturday evening at Philadelphia International Airport after two Syrian Christian families headed for Allentown and others were detained there.\n\nU.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., had not commented on the order as of Sunday afternoon, with his spokeswoman saying he was traveling and unavailable. Toomey had attended an event in Palm Springs, Calif., hosted by conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch.\n\nThe executive order issued Friday afternoon suspended entry of all refugees for 120 days, banned Syrian refugees indefinitely, and for 90 days, halted entry into the U.S. for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAs federal officials began to enforce that order, travelers were detained the Philadelphia airport and other airports across the country. A series of judicial orders late Saturday blocked the deportations of some travelers.\n\nBut before those legal challenges were filed, Syrian relatives of Sarah and Sarmad Assali of Allentown were detained Saturday and ultimately sent on a flight back to Qatar. The Assalis contacted Dent, who said he called the White House and congressional leaders to raise concerns about the administration policy.\n\n\"It appears this order has been rushed through without full consideration of the many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for vulnerable people across the world,\" said Dent, whose 15th District includes Lehigh County and part of Northampton County.\n\n\"This is not an acceptable situation, and I certainly urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more deliberate policy can be instated,\" Dent added.\n\nDent was joined early Sunday morning by U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-8th District, who released a statement saying that the executive order \"entirely misses the mark.\"\n\n\"The reality is, terrorism inspired by radicalism and hate is global in scope and, as such, requires a comprehensive response, not a purely regional focus,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"While serious actions are needed to protect our country, these must not be done in a way that singles out any specific nations or ethnicities.\"\n\nBoth Fitzpatrick and Dent said the current vetting system for refugees, which typically takes at least two years, could be strengthened. But Fitzpatrick said that should not be done in a way that would allow potential terrorists to change their tactics and \"exploit short-term fixes.\"\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, whose 17th District includes part of Northampton County, praised Dent in a statement, in which he described the executive order as \"ill-conceived, discriminatory and dangerous.\"\n\n\"Our national devotion to religious freedom and tolerance is not Republican or Democratic. It's American,\" Cartwright said.\n\nAs news spread of the detentions in Philadelphia and other airports, crowds of protesters gathered, later to be joined by Democratic legislators.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., was among those who headed to the airport Saturday evening. He was in Philadelphia for the Academy of Music's annual concert and ball, and arrived at the airport in a tuxedo with tails and white tie. Several Philadelphia-area congressmen, including U.S. Reps. Bob Brady and Dwight Evans, also were there to show their disagreement.\n\n\"If there's a way to make our refugee screening process better, I'm ready to discuss it,\" Casey posted on Twitter Saturday evening. \"But a #MuslimBan by another name is not who we are and won't make us any safer.\"\n\nOne local Republican, U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-11th District, has been supportive of the policy.\n\nBarletta, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, applauded Trump's order Friday, calling his actions \"prudent while we work on a system that allows us to verify the identity and background of applicants.\"\n\nlolson@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @LauraOlson\n\n202-780-9540", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Laura Olson", "type": "article"}
