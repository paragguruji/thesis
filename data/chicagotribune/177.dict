Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n1. Withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nThe trade pact among a dozen Pacific Rim nations was one of the most significant legislative undertakings of former President Obama\u2019s second term. Trump spoiled those efforts quickly.\n\nWhat the order does: Trump simply made clear that he would not even consider putting the agreement to a vote in Congress. The U.S. will withdraw as a signatory to the deal, and permanently withdraw from any further negotiations.\n\nThe member nations closed the agreement in 2015. But with most Democrats against it and pro-trade Republicans hesitant to support it in an election year, Obama decided to hold off on asking Congress to ratify the agreement until GOP leaders were confident it would pass. That moment never came.\n\nWhat it does not do: The directive does not mean Trump is taking the U.S. out of trade altogether. Indeed, Trump officials say he will consider seeking discrete trade agreements with many of the nations who were party to TPP. The U.S. has bilateral agreements with many already.\n\nTrump\u2019s move was \u201ca strong signal that the Trump administration wants free and fair trade throughout the world,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters.\n\n\u201cThis executive action ushers in a new era of U.S. trade policy in which the Trump administration will pursue bilateral trade opportunities with allies around the globe,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, there are potential national security implications to the withdrawal from TPP. The Obama administration had sold some lawmakers on supporting it with the argument that it was essential to curbing growing Chinese influence in the region.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a supporter of the deal, said the decision would \u201chave lasting consequences for America\u2019s economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region\u2026. It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers.\u201d\n\n2. Reinstating a ban on funding some abortion services\n\nWhat the order does: Trump\u2019s order reimposes a ban, initiated in 1984 by then-President Reagan, on government support for international aid groups that provide or counsel women on abortion services.\n\nTo receive any U.S. aid, nongovernmental organizations will now have to certify that they will not \u201cperform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning,\u201d even if that work is supported by funding from sources other than the U.S. government.\n\nThis ban, often called the global gag rule, was lifted by Obama shortly after he took office in 2009 in response to widespread criticism of the restriction by global health advocates who say it imperils women's health by cutting access to family planning services and forcing women to seek unsafe abortions.\n\nWhat it does not do: The order does not affect family planning or abortion policy in the U.S..\n\nCongress already restricts federal funding for abortion, but groups that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, can receive government funding for other healthcare services. Planned Parenthood, for example, provides preventive health services such as cancer screenings to many poor women around the country. These are often reimbursed through the government Medicaid program.\n\nCongressional Republicans are now trying to cut all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, even for non-abortion services.\n\n3. Ordering a government-wide hiring freeze\n\nWhat the order does: The Trump administration directed the leaders of all federal agencies and departments to freeze hiring of new personnel. Any vacancies in the federal workforce as of noon on Sunday must remain unfilled, and no new positions may be created \u201cexcept in limited circumstances,\u201d the order stated.\n\nThe decision is meant to \u201ccounter the dramatic expansion\u201d of the federal workforce since the Clinton administration \u2014 from 1.8 million civilian employees to 2.1 million. The costs of health and retirement benefits \u201care unsustainable,\u201d the administration said.\n\n\u201cThere's been frankly, to some degree, a lack of respect for taxpayer dollars in this town for a long time,\u201d Spicer told reporters Monday.\n\nWhat the order does not do: The military is exempt from the freeze. Each department or agency can also exempt \u201cany positions that it deems necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities.\u201d\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
