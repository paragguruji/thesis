Others will invite lawsuits from a vast army of opponents. Yet in total, they represent a major shift in the nation\u2019s approach to immigration and an early indication that Trump plans to boldly reshape government as he promised on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump, in office less than a week, has shown few signs of letting up on his vow to dramatically limit the flow of people from other nations. In addition to Wednesday\u2019s two orders, he is considering a flurry of additional ones that would temporarily ban all new refugees and narrow the openings for people traveling from Muslim-dominated countries.\n\n\"A nation without borders is not a nation,\" Trump said to employees at the Department of Homeland Security. \"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.\"\n\nThe most immediate impact of Trump\u2019s actions might be a vast increase in the number of people subject to detention and deportation. Trump\u2019s orders call for an expansion of detention facilities holding asylum seekers and others awaiting immigration hearings. It would end so-called catch-and-release practices that allow those migrants to remain at large if there is overcrowding or if they are mothers with children, unaccompanied minors or face a credible fear of persecution from their home countries.\n\nTrump\u2019s orders would also put a greater emphasis on deporting not only those convicted of crimes, but also people in the country illegally who were charged with crimes not yet adjudicated, those who receive an improper welfare benefit and even those who have not been charged but are believed to have committed \u201cacts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to get them out, and we're going to get them out fast.\u201d\n\nImmigration rights groups and politicians representing liberal localities known as sanctuary cities and states vowed resistance \u2014 in Congress, local legislative bodies and in court \u2014 inviting what is likely to be years of litigation.\n\nWatch: President Trump speaks at the Department of Homeland Security \u00bb\n\n\u201cDirecting a deportation force to break up immigrant families contributing to our country is not a show of strength,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said. \u201cIt damages our communities and erodes local economies.\u201d\n\nHarris said Trump had used his first days in office to target the \u201cvoiceless and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nCalifornia alone receives as much as $105 billion a year in federal dollars, though it\u2019s unclear how much of that money would be put in jeopardy as a result of Trump\u2019s orders, which give power to the U.S. attorney general and Homeland Security secretary to withhold grant money. The most likely targets are money for equipment, prisoner detention and officer training.\n\nTrump scared and angered minorities and others when he opened his campaign by saying some Mexicans who came to the U.S. brought drugs and crime and were rapists.\n\nHe echoed some of that explosive language Wednesday: \u201cWe are going to get the bad ones out: the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members and cartel leaders.\u201d\n\nThe need for more money to fund Trump\u2019s agenda will ensure Congress continues to play a role and could delay implementing some of his measures, including the hiring of 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, which would bring the total to 26,000, and 10,000 new immigration officers, tripling their ranks to 15,000.\n\nOthers require less money but will help Trump, a strong believer in the power of branding, to send a message. He ordered the Homeland Security Department to publish a list every week of crimes committed by people in the U.S. illegally, along with names of police departments that failed to detain them.\n\nIn addition to penalizing cities and states that refuse to work with immigration authorities, Trump immediately restored the Secure Communities program in which immigration officers were notified each time an immigrant who has entered the country illegally is booked into a local jail.\n\nThough Congress seems likely to approve spending on agents and holding cells, Trump\u2019s border wall \u2014 his signature campaign promise \u2014 could be a tougher sell. He directed federal workers to start construction, allowing Homeland Security to redirect about $175 million already set aside for upgrading Border Patrol buildings and adding new equipment.\n\nBut a wall all along the 2,000-mile border, which Trump has called for, would cost billions. Trump has said the U.S. would pay for it, while insisting it would eventually be reimbursed by Mexico. But Mexico says it won\u2019t pay for the wall.\n\n\"There will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,\" Trump said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nHe did not detail how he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, though during the campaign he proposed ending remittances sent home by Mexicans in the U.S., which make up a large part of Mexico\u2019s economy, to pressure its leaders to negotiate.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement is certain to add discomfort to next week\u2019s visit from Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is under intense pressure at home to repudiate Trump\u2019s insistence that his country will pay for a wall, and a spokesman said he did not know whether Pe\u00f1a Nieto would come to the White House.\n\nA wall will help Mexico crack down on cartels and stop immigrants moving north from Central America, Trump said. He also promised to help stop cash and guns from flowing south out of the U.S.\n\nTrump is weighing a range of additional activity. They would include stopping admission of Syrian refugees and severe restrictions on travel from several majority-Muslim countries, matching a campaign promise that was one of his most divisive.\n\nAdditionally, he is considering a reversal of former President Obama\u2019s efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the reintroduction of torture techniques and secret overseas prisons designed to strip protections for terrorism suspects.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "authors": "Brian Bennett, Noah Bierman", "type": "article"}
