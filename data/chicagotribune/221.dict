Tax returns, of course. But also Social Security cards, school enrollment forms and English language class registration for her in-laws and their children \u2014 six Christian immigrants who arrived in America on Monday after having their visas revoked nine days earlier in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order banning travel.\n\n\"How many wives do you know who would go to these lengths for their in-laws?\" Sarmad, 52, joked over breakfast as her husband's brothers, Basam and Hassan Abou Asali, passed around the pita, makdous, labneh and za'atar. \"People must think I'm nuts!\"\n\nPICTURES: Syrian family looks ahead after chaotic recent past (April Bartholomew) (April Bartholomew)\n\nIt's been a long few weeks for the Assalis. Sarmad, a Syrian-American who immigrated in 1978, buried her mother Hasna Saoud on Jan. 27, the day before the Abou Asalis were supposed to arrive. Her mother had lived with Sarmad and Ghassan for six years.\n\nThe Syrian relatives offered to postpone the trip while she was in mourning, but Sarmad wouldn't hear of it \u2014 not after they had worked 13 years to obtain visas and permanent residency.\n\nTrump's executive order went into effect while the immigrants were in the air that day. They were briefly detained at Philadelphia International Airport and then sent back to their home in Damascus.\n\nDamascus \u2014 where a bomb shattered glass onto Hassan's children's beds minutes after they had gotten up. Where another bomb took the arm of a fellow shopowner moments after Basam left his side. Where electricity is unreliable and the water is contaminated and no one, evidently, feels like buying the oriental ornaments the brothers make.\n\n\"Over the years they kept calling and asking, 'So-and-so got a visa, where are ours?'\" Sarmad said. \"I could only tell them, 'I don't know. We're working on it. You've got to go by the process.'\"\n\nIn October 2015, nearly five years into the Syrian war, the Abou Asalis got their initial approvals. It took another 14 months to complete the next round of paperwork, interviews and background checks.\n\nTrump says he wants to keep America safe, and Sarmad gets that \u2014 \"nobody wants 9/11 to ever happen again.\"\n\n\"But they've been duly vetted,\" she said. \"It's not like this was something that happened overnight. They've waited their turn, and they've waited patiently.\"\n\nGhassan Assali was on his way to pick up this family in Philadelphia on Jan. 28 when he got a call from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, who told him not to bother coming because his relatives had been sent back on the same plane.\n\nPhiladelphia immigration attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union worked since then to get the Abou Asalis a special waiver for travelers whose visas are revoked on unlawful grounds. U.S. Rep Charlie Dent, R-15, worked with the United Arab Emirates to ensure the family traveled Sunday through Abu Dhabi, one of 15 U.S. preclearance places worldwide.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf is paying out of his own pocket for the family's airfare, and the money from a GoFundMe campaign that was started to help pay for the family's travel will be used to get them started on their lives in the U.S. It's raised nearly $23,000.\n\nSince their arrival Monday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, the congratulatory calls and texts have kept coming, Sarmad said. Many have asked: What's next?\n\nThe adults will take English language classes so they can find good work, Sarmad said, and the brothers will perhaps return to their craft.\n\nMathyo Abou Asali, 17, will finish secondary education at Dieruff High School. Sarmad is looking into enrolling Sara Abou Asali, 19, at Lehigh Carbon Community College.\n\n\"When you become a permanent resident, you don't do vacation,\" Sarmad said. \"You come to work. You survive and make a better future.\"\n\nHer husband, Ghassan, was back to work Tuesday at his Hamilton Street dental practice, where he said he received a few nasty phone calls and letters the past week following one report that the family voted for Trump.\n\nBoth Ghassan and Sarmad said Tuesday that they did not vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton, whose call for more airstrikes in Syria they feared would lead to more civilian deaths. Like many Americans, they were not particularly excited about either candidate.\n\nSarmad said she hoped Trump would support the Assad-led Syrian Armed Forces in fighting ISIS and providing basic necessities for civilians.\n\nBut they're skeptical of his leadership so far. Ghassan questioned how Trump chose the seven countries included in his travel ban, given that none of the 9/11 attackers originated from them.\n\nNoticing her husband become animated, Sarmad pointed to their relatives around the kitchen and said, \"They're here, they're safe. We accomplished our goal.\"\n\nIn fact, Monday afternoon was the first time many members of both Sarmad's family and Ghassan's family were together under the same roof. Sarmad moved to Salisbury Township in 1978 and met Ghassan in 1989 back in Syria during a friend's wedding. He moved to the U.S. the following year, and most of his family was unable to attend their wedding here.\n\nSarmad's two sisters and brother had lunch prepared by the time they returned from JFK with the Abou Asalis. Sarmad called it a fiesta, and the only thing that had to wait for another day was the Dabke \u2014 an Arab folk dance.\n\n\"We've been exhausted this past week,\" she said. \"But when you're all sitting together and we're all talking at the same time, you just look around and pinch yourself. It's just happy days.\"\n\nTIMELINE\n\nJan. 28: The Abou Asali family of Syria is turned away at Philadelphia International Airport the same day President Trump's travel ban goes into effect.\n\nJan. 29: Ghassan and Sarmad Assali of Allentown meet with Gov. Tom Wolf and immigration lawyers about getting their family's visas restored.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Andrew Wagaman", "type": "article"}
