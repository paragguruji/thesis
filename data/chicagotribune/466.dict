The UN is not a perfect entity but its partners fight to protect children, the environment, human rights, and health around the world. Under Trump\u2019s ban, humanitarian workers from seven Muslim countries will now be prevented from attending trainings and meetings at the New York City and Washington, D.C. headquarters.\n\nThe isolation of blocking people from entering the U.S. under legal or refugee status, paired with the refusal to provide collaboration abroad, will be another detrimental piece in the breakdown of our national security and global leadership, not to mention our moral dignity. We must use our voices to advocate for our neighbors down the street, across the country and around the world.\n\nKarli Chudeau\n\nSan Marcos\n\n* * *\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s actions have a common theme: \u201cAmerica First.\u201d That\u2019s what he promised, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.\n\nSam Thompson\n\nPoway\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding \u201cBetter options than Trump\u2019s wall exist\u201d (Jan. 27): The writer proposed selling immigrants a yearly work permit. Half of the money could be used for health care. It would also be a way to screen out the bad actors wanting to come here from south of the border.\n\nThese, along with some other ideas, could be implemented to impact the illegal immigration problem. It might not eliminate the need for a wall, but could be a step in the right direction. A different slant on work permits that have previously been proposed.\n\nDoug Morrison\n\nOceanside\n\n* * *\n\nI am for the wall and believe Mexico should pay for it. For most of the 20th century, the government of Mexico closed its eyes to its people \u201cgoing north\u201d illegally as a means to lesson open revolt. With foreign countries building industrial plants along most of its northern border and with its truck farming replacing coastal California jobs, its citizens are now able to support their families without going so far away.\n\nThe Mexican government is aware that the problem today is the people \u201cjust passing through\u201d Mexico, from Central America and other countries, not the Mexicans, and thus continues to turn a blind eye.\n\nWhile the cost of \u201cthe wall\u201d will be high, whether Mexico pays for it or not, a greater cost to Mexico will come when all those streaming in from the south will be hindered from crossing \u201cthe wall\u201d and Mexico will be stuck with their seeking asylum.\n\nRichard Jensen\n\nSan Diego\n\n* * *\n\nTrump won the election, and he has a right to make executive decisions based upon his promises. Unfortunately, I am concerned about Trump's flexibility to make changes if his actions prove to be detrimental. This is a man with a hair trigger who never admits when he is wrong and seems to lie more often than tell the truth.\n\nI am concerned about the \"alternative facts\" presented by Trump and his staff. It is critical that we monitor the results of this administration's actions in terms of unemployment, poverty, real wages, health care, GDP, national debt, crime and world terrorism. If there are problems, we can vote again in two years for Congress members who are willing to make corrections - including impeachment.\n\nRonald Harris\n\nScripps Ranch\n\n* * *\n\nCould you publish a list of Trump hotels and things that the Trump family is importing, so the World\u2019s people can ban them?\n\nRoger Newell\n\nSan Diego\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding \u201cTrump temporarily closes U.S. borders to refugees\u201d (Jan. 28): Even with quote marks around Trump's words as printed in Saturday's U-T, it's wrong to print something that will be read by many and accepted as a fact. Paragraph four quotes Trump, \"If you were a Muslim you could come in (to the U.S.) but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.\"\n\nA Pew Foundation study has shown this is not true. Do more fact-checking before printing such a sentence, or indicate that this is Trump making up his own alternative facts.\n\nDonna Raub\n\nSolana Beach\n\n* * *\n\nSo much for those who thought the the advisers around the president would be a mitigating influence. Now we see that Bannon is the only one who really has the ear of the president.\n\nThey didn\u2019t bother informing anyone in the administration, probably because they would have gotten some push back or at least a review of the legality. And now Bannon, who did not have to go through any approval process by Congress, is now on the National Security Council. This is the person who declared the Breitbart website, which he co-founded and ran, \"the platform for the alt-right\u201d.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "U-T Letters, Andrew Kleske", "type": "article"}
