The government has estimated there are about 24,000 refugees with a formal assurance.\n\nThe ruling does not drive to the heart of whether the travel ban is lawful. The Supreme Court is still scheduled to hear arguments on that next month. And given that the measure was supposed to have been temporary - 90 days for citizens of the six countries affected by the ban and 120 days for refugees - it is also possible that the dispute will be moot by then.\n\nIn the 9th Circuit, the parties had essentially been arguing over who could be excluded from entering the United States after the justices in June ruled that a limited version of the travel ban could take effect.\n\nThe high court had said officials could not enforce the measure on those with \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the United States, but offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify.\n\n\"Close familial\" relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \"formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\" The same standard applied to both citizens of the six countries affected by the ban, as well as all refugees.\n\nThe government initially sought to block grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the country from entering, along with refugees with a formal assurance letter from a resettlement agency, but a U.S. district judge ultimately stopped them from doing so. The Supreme Court then put on hold the portion of that district judge's ruling on refugees, but not on grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States. That led to the legal wrangling before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\nThe 9th Circuit judges wrote that the government had not offered persuasive evidence that grandparents and other extended relatives did not count as \"close\" family members, rejecting the government's argument that they had drawn their position from immigration law. They rejected similar arguments on refugees with assurances.\n\nThe 9th Circuit opinion was written by judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez, all appointed by President Bill Clinton.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-07", "authors": "Matt Zapotosky", "type": "article"}
