It also agreed to hear Trump\u2019s claim of broad power over immigration.\n\nHowever, the cases may be dismissed as moot because the time limits in the order have expired and because the White House released a new and expanded travel ban on Sept. 24. The court postponed arguments that had been scheduled for Oct. 10 in Trump vs. Hawaii and Trump vs. IRAP. The justices may wait to decide the issue until judges rule on the president\u2019s revised travel order which has no time limits.\n\nReligious liberty and gay rights\n\nCan a baker refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his Christian beliefs, or can the state require that businesses open to the public provide \u201cfull and equal\u201d services to customers without regard to their sexual orientation?\n\nColorado and 20 other states have civil rights laws that protect gays and lesbians. Trump administration lawyers have urged the court to carve out a \u201cnarrow\u201d exception based on the freedom of speech for cake makers, photographers, musicians and others whose work is \u201cexpressive.\u201d\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado is due to be heard in December.\n\nPartisan gerrymandering\n\nWhen one party controls a state\u2019s government, can it draw election district maps to \u201centrench\u201d itself in the majority for another decade, even in elections where most voters cast ballots for other party?\n\nSince the 1980s, the justices have frowned on \u201cpartisan gerrymandering\u201d as unfair and corrupt, but they have not agreed on a rule for when an election map tilts so far as to be unconstitutional. By contrast, the court has outlawed racial gerrymandering, but often the lines between racial and partisan gerrymandering are blurred.\n\nThe justices will tackle partisan gerrymandering again in a Wisconsin case, Gill vs. Whitford, to be heard on Oct. 3.\n\nCellphone tracking and privacy\n\nCan the FBI and police obtain cellphone data to track the movements of a crime suspect because such phone company-held records are not private, or must they first obtain a search warrant based on probable cause from a magistrate?\n\nPrivacy advocates on the right and left urge the court to strictly protect these records. However, investigators say they sometimes need the data to track travel patterns to identify a crime suspect or a terrorist.\n\nCarpenter vs. United States is to be heard in December.\n\nEmployees and group arbitration\n\nCan companies require workers to waive their rights to join any class or collective action against their employer and instead resolve disputes as individuals through binding arbitration?\n\nObama administration lawyers told the court these arbitration clauses were illegal under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which said workers had a right to join a union or take \u201cother concerted activities.\u201d In June, the Trump administration switched sides and said these waivers could be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925.\n\nThe court will hear the arguments on Oct. 2 in NLRB vs. Murphy Oil USA and two related cases.\n\nJail before deportation\n\nCan noncitizens who are slated for deportation be kept in jail indefinitely, or must they be given a bail hearing after six months?\n\nActing on a class-action suit in Los Angeles, the 9th Circuit Court said such detainees have a right to bail after six months if they pose no danger to the public and are unlikely to flee. The justices heard the government\u2019s appeal in November, shortly after Trump\u2019s election, but could not reach a decision.\n\nThe case, Jennings vs. Rodriguez, will be argued again Oct. 3, and this time Justice Neil M. Gorsuch can cast the deciding vote.\n\nVoting rolls and purges\n\nCan states remove voters from their rolls if they fail to vote for two years and do not respond to notices over four years?\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court agreed with civil rights lawyers who said this procedure in Ohio violated a federal law that says a voter\u2019s registration may not be canceled for \u201ca failure to vote.\u201d\n\nHusted vs. A. Philip Randolph Institute is to be heard on November 8.\n\nSports betting\n\nCan New Jersey allow sports betting at its casinos and racetracks, or must it abide by a federal law that prohibits gambling on sports, except in Nevada?\n\nThe state has lost repeatedly in lower courts, but the justices will hear its appeal in Christie vs. NCAA.\n\nPublic employees and union fees\n\nCan states require teachers and other unionized public employees to pay a fee to cover the cost of collective bargaining?\n\nThe court upheld such laws 40 years ago, but anti-union lawyers say these forced payments violate the free-speech rights of workers.\n\nThe court was set to decide this issue in 2016 in the case of a California teacher, but after Justice Antonin Scalia died, the justices were split 4-4.\n\nAn Illinois child care worker has a new appeal pending this month. The court announced on Sept. 28 it will hear Janus vs. AFSCME.\n\nJob discrimination and gay employees\n\nDoes the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids employers from discriminating against employees because of their sex, also forbid firing people because of their sexual orientation?\n\nEarlier this year, the 7th Circuit Court in Chicago broke new ground when it ruled that federal law forbids job discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThe 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta reached the opposite conclusion in a case involving a Georgia woman who was pushed out of her job as a hospital security guard because she was a lesbian.\n\nEarlier this month she appealed and asked the justices to decide the question in this term. They have not announced whether they will hear Evans vs. Georgia Regional Hospital.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
