And while their chants echoed those heard in recent protests around the country \u2014 like \"no hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here\" \u2014 the Northwestern rally focused especially on the effects that immigration restrictions might have on campus.\n\n\"Our learning is enriched by having people from all over the world here,\" said Ngozi Nezianya, 29, a third year graduate student in law and business, as he marched up Sheridan Road. \"We are a country of immigrants, founded by immigrants. It's important we stand up for them.\"\n\nNorthwestern students and staff protest on campus against proposed immigration rules on Feb. 9, 2017.

(Genevieve Bookwalter / Pioneer Press) (Genevieve Bookwalter / Pioneer Press)\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order Jan. 27 that barred entry into this country for some people from seven predominantly-Muslim nations.\n\nBut parts of order are currently on hold after a federal judge in Seattle on Feb. 3 ordered a stay.\n\nBoth Northwestern and Evanston officials have promised protection for immigrants.\n\n\"We will take all the necessary steps to protect our faculty and students, particularly international students,\" said Ravi Shankar, director of the international office at Northwestern.\n\nEvanston Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl touted the city's \"welcoming city\" status, which prohibits Evanston police from holding undocumented immigrants for immigration authorities after a stop. Exceptions include those convicted for serious crimes or already sought on an arrest warrant, according to language in a recent sanctuary ordinance the city adopted.\n\nPolice also cannot ask crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status, the ordinance reads.\n\nTisdahl reminded Northwestern students that while they are uniquely affected by immigration restrictions, they are in a unique situation to fight those proposals.\n\n\"Get on the phone tonight. Call your parents. Call your great-aunt Sally,\" Tisdahl said. \"You need to pledge to me you're going to push all the cities you come from to pass welcoming city ordinances.\"\n\nRustin Golnabi, 22, is a second-year doctoral student in material science and co-organizer of Thursday's the rally. His parents immigrated from Iran and he was born in the United States, he said. He worries what might happen to them but has been encouraged by the campus response.\n\n\"At first there was a feeling of loneliness and despair and fear,\" Golnabi said.\n\nRecently though, \"you become hopeful because you see how much support there is out there.\"\n\ngbookwalter@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @GenevieveBook", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Genevieve Bookwalter", "type": "article"}
