But she warned that progress is threatened by Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing signals of a shift that should alarm us all,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis administration\u2019s proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country.\u201d\n\nClinton then raised the letter signed by 120 former generals and admirals beseeching the Trump administration not to make the cuts.\n\n\u201cThese distinguished men and women who have served in uniform recognize that turning our back on diplomacy won\u2019t make our country safer. It will undermine our security and our standing in the world.\u201d\n\nA lot has changed since Clinton was on the campaign trail, but some things about her style on the stump haven\u2019t. She pulled out a favorite line from last year as she began to talk about a study that backed up her point about the damage Trump\u2019s budget plan could do.\n\n\u201cHere I go again,\u201d Clinton said to whooping and cheering from an audience of mostly female students, \u201ctalking about research evidence and facts.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Evan Halper", "type": "article"}
