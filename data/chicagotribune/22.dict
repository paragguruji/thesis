However, we have an obligation to speak out when government actions are fundamentally antithetical to the core values and missions of the institution,\" Loh said.\n\nOne graduate student was blocked while trying to return to the U.S., and possibly three others have also been blocked, Loh said.\n\nAlso, a visiting professor told the university he would not be coming to campus as a personal protest. The professor was not subject to the ban.\n\nLoh reaffirmed the university will not release information on the immigration status of students unless forced by court order.\n\nLoh was born in China and moved with his family to Peru. After completing high school in Peru, he immigrated to the U.S. and became a naturalized citizen.\n\nTrump and White House aides have defended the ban as a necessary step for national security despite growing criticism and widespread protests at airports around the country and abroad.\n\nCAPTION The University of Maryland, College Park announced Wednesday it has received a $219 million donation from the A.
