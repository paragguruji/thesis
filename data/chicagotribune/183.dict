{"title": "A showdown between Texas and local officials centers on the state's 'sanctuary' cities ban", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-texas-sanctuary-ban-20170626-story.html", "text": "Hundreds of immigrant advocates gathered outside a federal courthouse here Monday as local officials from across Texas squared off for a legal showdown with the state and federal governments over the state\u2019s new anti-\u201csanctuary city\u201d law.\n\nMayors, council members and county judges from tiny border towns and big Texas cities were packed inside. One by one, their attorneys called for U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia to temporarily halt implementation of Senate Bill 4, which aims to force local municipalities to help detain immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nThe law, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May and set to take effect Sept. 1, allows local law enforcement to ask about the immigration status of anyone they legally detain or arrest, including people stopped for minor traffic violations.\n\nIt would also require local police to comply with federal immigration requests to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally. Police chiefs and county sheriffs who refuse could face harsh fines or spend up to a year in jail.\n\n\"Local police officers are going to enforce to the hilt, because why take a chance?\u201d Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union representing the small border city of El Cenizo, told the judge.\n\nHe suggested that the law could encourage police officers to conduct traffic stops in areas where there are day laborers and lead to a \u201csituation that incentivizes people to enforce immigration law to the maximum.\u201d\n\nBut state and federal attorneys downplayed the effect of the new law, arguing that it did not go as far as Arizona's contentious Senate Bill 1070 \u2014 known as the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law \u2014 that the U.S. Supreme Court partially invalidated in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt is a moderate law that fits hand in glove with federal immigration policies,\" said Darren McCarty, an attorney for Texas. \u201cIt is not a \u2018show your papers\u2019 law. It does not mandate that officers requests immigration papers.\u2026 There is no fair reading of Senate Bill 4 that would allow Texas law enforcement officers to do anything beyond inquiring on immigration status.\u201d\n\nIn passing the bill, legislators simply intended to ensure a unified application of immigration law rather than a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of different immigration policies, McCarty argued.\n\nFive Texas cities, as well as several counties and sheriffs, challenged the law\u2019s constitutionality. Originally filed by El Cenizo, the lawsuit grew to include bigger cities such as San Antonio, Austin, Dallas and Houston.\n\nThey say that the law is overly vague and an \u201cextraordinary intrusion\u201d on local officials\u2019 ability to govern as they see fit. Their attorneys argued that it preempts federal law and violates the 4th Amendment right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and the 14th Amendment right to equal protection.\n\nThey also say a requirement in the law that no local official \u201cendorse\u201d a policy that limits the enforcement of immigration laws violates the 1st Amendment right to free speech.\n\n\u201cThis is the first test, under the Trump administration, of a state attack on sanctuary cities,\u201d Ilya Somin, a constitutional law professor at George Mason University in Alexandria, Va., said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf the Texas law ends up being upheld, that might encourage other states to introduce similar legislation.\u201d\n\nErez Reuveni, an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, said that although the federal government does not require local governments to comply with federal detention requests, it welcomed the new law.\n\nNothing prevents a state from directing law enforcement officers to cooperate with the federal government, he said.\n\nThough the federal government can\u2019t tell local officials to detain somebody, \u201cthe states absolutely can tell them to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nOpponents of the law argued that it threatens public safety by weakening trust between police and the community, deterring immigrants from reporting crimes and diverting busy law enforcement officers from their regular duties.\n\nThe state countered that it was ridiculous to think that a police officer would ignore a report of violent crime to conduct an immigration query instead.\n\n\u201cNo police department would ever be prosecuted for leaving the scene of detention for a more pressing situation,\u201d McCarty said.\n\nThe judge, an appointee of President Clinton, listened with a hand clutching his forehead and asked attorneys from both sides a barrage of questions about how the new law would be implemented.\n\nCould local police officers conduct their own immigration raids? If an officer stopped a speeding driver, could he ask all passengers in the car about their immigration status? What would happen if an officer did not share the information that someone was in the country to federal immigration officials?\n\nA local law enforcement officer who did not pass on information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not be in violation of the law, a state attorney said. The law, he argued, is focused on police chiefs and sheriffs who instruct rank-and-file officers not to ask people about their immigration status.\n\nThe daylong hearing ended without Garcia ruling on whether he will halt Texas from enforcing the law.\n\nSherine Thomas, an attorney for Travis County, told the court that with so little agreement over how to interpret the law, it only made sense to put it on hold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for elected officials to know what they can and can\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way the [state] attorney general reads it isn\u2019t enough solace.\u201d\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
