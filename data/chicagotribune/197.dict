{"title": "Appeals court rules against Trump administration, relaxing travel ban restrictions again", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-travel-ban-trump-2017-story.html", "text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to block more travelers from six Muslim-majority nations and permitted all vetted refugees to be admitted.\n\nThe decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals could significantly decrease the number of people stopped from traveling to the U.S. under President Trump\u2019s travel ban. The ban currently halts nearly all refugee resettlement and travel by foreign nationals from six mostly Muslim countries unless they have close connections in the U.S.\n\nThe panel of judges, Michael Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez, did not decide whether the ban is legal. That question is left to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear arguments over the issue on Oct. 10.\n\nInstead, the judges, all Democratic appointees, ruled on the scope of the ban.\n\nThe Justice Department said it would challenge Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Supreme Court \u201cto vindicate the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation.\u201d\n\nHawaii Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin said the state \u201cwill keep fighting back,\u201d adding: \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the 9th Circuit keeps families together.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ban, ordered in January and later modified, barred travel to the U.S. by nationals from Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran for 90 days and stopped all refugee resettlement for 120 days.\n\nFederal appeals courts had blocked the ban until June, when the Supreme Court said it could take effect as long as it did not stop travel of anyone with a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship to the U.S.\n\nAside from a handful of examples \u2014 such as people who have university admission and employment offers in the U.S. and those residing in the U.S. who have parents-in-law abroad \u2014 the Supreme Court did not define what counts as a bona fide U.S. connection.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that family connections should include only people with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, or a parent-in-law in the U.S.\n\nIn July, a federal judge in Hawaii ruled that exceptions also had to be made for grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law.\n\nThe 9th Circuit agreed.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe Trump administration also argued that a refugee\u2019s relationship to a resettlement agency by itself did not constitute a bona fide U.S. connection.\n\nThe Hawaii judge disagreed, clearing the way for travel by about 24,000 refugees who had been approved for U.S. resettlement but blocked by the travel ban.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which placed a hold on the judge\u2019s ruling on refugees until the 9th Circuit could consider the case.\n\nIn upholding the Hawaii judge\u2019s decision, the 9th Circuit said it considered \u201cthe individualized screening process necessary to obtain a formal assurance\u201d and the \u201cconcrete harms\u201d faced by resettlement agencies when refugees are excluded.\n\n\u201cIf a refugee does not arrive in the United States, or is delayed in arriving, the agency will lose the money and resources it has already expended in preparing for arrival, including securing rental housing, buying furniture and arranging for basic necessities,\u201d the panel said.\n\nMore than 175,000 refugees currently lack formal assurances and will not be allowed entry, the 9th Circuit said.\n\nThe court said its ruling would take effect in five days.\n\n\u201cRefugees\u2019 lives remain in vulnerable limbo during the pendency of the Supreme Court\u2019s stay,\u201d the panel said. \u201cRefugees have only a narrow window of time to complete their travel, as certain security and medical checks expire and must then be reinitiated.\u201d\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
