Readers on the essential question about the Playboy founder", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/readersreact/la-ol-le-hugh-hefner-sexism-20170930-story.html", "text": "It's not exactly news that Hugh Hefner, the perpetually robed Playboy founder who died Wednesday at the age of 91, is a polarizing figure. For decades Americans have disagreed about whether he should be remembered as a great liberator of Americans from their sexual puritanism or as a sexist exploiter of women.\n\nOn Thursday, columnist Robin Abcarian came down strongly on the latter side, writing that although we shouldn\u2019t forget Hefner\u2019s support for smart journalism, reproductive rights and civil liberties, we should also not lose sight of the fact that his core business was the objectification of women \u2014 mostly women under 30 \u2014 and the exalting of exclusively male fantasies.\n\nBefore Abcarian\u2019s column was published, the letters on Hefner\u2019s death reflected the typical mix of opinions we get after most notable celebrity passings: Several mentioned the existence of strong polarization over Hefner\u2019s work without taking a side, others reflected dispassionately on his work, and a few recounted their own experiences with Hefner. It was only in response to Abcarian\u2019s column that more readers started expressing stronger opinions on Hefner\u2019s work itself.\n\nI wonder if Hefner ever thought about the destruction he may have caused by promoting to men they were entitled to hedonism. \u2014 Robin Provart-Kelly, Culver City\n\nHere is what they said.\n\nRobin Provart-Kelly of Culver City wonders how much Playboy may have influenced her own father:\n\nProps to Abcarian for her article on Hefner. I read with disgust in other pieces about his Playboy Clubs, starting in the 1950s Chicago, and his interest in jazz and felt like they were describing my father\u2019s life.\n\nI could not help but wonder if the evisceration and abandonment of my own family started there for my dad, in Chicago before he moved us to L.A. and unceremoniously dumped us. He was a lifelong subscriber to the magazine.\n\nI wonder if Hefner ever thought about the destruction he may have caused by promoting to men they were entitled to hedonism and not responsible to the people they had spawned.\n\nThe only thing Hefner should be lauded for is his business acumen. Thanks to Abcarian for speaking for people like me.\n\nStudio City resident R. William Schoettler doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame Hefner for exploitation:\n\nMy oh my, what a shame! Did Hefner really exploit women? How embarrassing.\n\nEverywhere I look \u2014 on television, in newspapers, in magazines and on billboards \u2014 I see pictures of young, pretty, mostly white women, flaunting their chests and very white smiles while touting the benefits of some product. The various \u201cred carpets\u201d are peopled by, what a shame, women displaying as much of their upper bodies as possible.\n\nAnd poor Hefner is accused of \u201cexploiting\u201d women. Interesting.\n\nBarri Clark of Los Angeles considers Hefner\u2019s responsibility for the \u201cmale gaze\u201d:\n\nAbcarian will no doubt take flak for her view of Hefner\u2019s effect on American culture. I for one am grateful to have someone finally address the bottom line.\n\nThe \u201cmale gaze\u201d is a profound concept implicated in a bunny suit and crystallized in the anatomically correct robotic gamines described in your Sept. 25 report, \u201cAvailable soon: Sex robots with artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nBy the way, I saw no mention of production of an equivalent male line.\n\nDonald Stuefloten of Hemet asks who exploited whom?\n\nThere was only one Hugh Hefner, but there were thousands of Playmates.\n\nWhy did so many pretty young women rush to take advantage of some rich old guy? Doesn\u2019t that seem sexist?\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-30", "authors": "Paul Thornton", "type": "article"}
