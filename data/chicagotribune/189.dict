Lawyers for some of the affected immigrants said border agents seemed uncertain about the new rules and were disagreeing with one another about which travelers were affected and which were not.\n\nFurther complicating the picture was a statement from the Department of Homeland Security asserting that its agents would enforce all of Trump\u2019s orders while also complying with judicial orders. As some of the orders block deportation, that left individual officers to try to figure out which priorities to honor.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Christi Parsons", "type": "article"}
