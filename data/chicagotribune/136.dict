A judge in Maryland blocked it, and the 4th Circuit Court agreed on the grounds it reflected religious discrimination against Muslims. A judge in Hawaii also blocked it, and the 9th Circuit Court in California upheld his decision, ruling Trump had not shown the travel ban was needed to protect against terrorism.\n\nThe administration's lawyers insist both rulings are fundamentally mistaken. And they have filed two separate requests with the high court.\n\nFirst, they urged the justices to issue an order that would allow Trump's plan to take effect immediately. If so, the limited ban would run for 90 days.\n\nAnd second, they asked the justices to grant review in the fall of the two lower rulings so they can rule broadly on the president's power to prevent certain foreigners from entering the country.\n\nIn Wednesday's appeal, acting Solicitor Gen. Jeffrey Wall quoted Justice Kennedy's words from an opinion issued two days ago. \"National security policy is the prerogative of the Congress and the President,\" Kennedy said. Courts should \"accord deference to what the Executive Branch has determined is essential to the national security,\" he said in Ziglar vs. Abbasi.\n\nKennedy was explaining the court's reasons for throwing out a post-9/11 lawsuit against top Bush administration officials who had ordered a roundup of Muslim immigrants in the New York area.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kennedy also figures to hold a decisive vote in the travel ban case.\n\nIt is not clear how the justices will proceed, let alone what they will decide.\n\nOne option would be to issue a short order with no explanation. They could refuse to put Trump's order into immediate effect, but also agree to hear the administration's appeal in the fall. If the justices are closely divided, they may opt for this mixed result.\n\nIf the court's conservatives can muster five votes, they could put Trump's order into effect immediately. But doing so would almost surely prompt a sharp dissent from the liberals.\n\nIt is also possible the justices may agree with some legal analysts who have argued that the need for a temporary travel ban has passed, because Trump's team has now had ample time to devise new \"vetting procedures\" for the six nations. Even so, however, the court's conservatives are not likely to let the two appellate court rulings stand unchallenged as the law.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-02", "authors": "David Savage", "type": "article"}
