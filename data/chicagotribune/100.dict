(Richard Drew / Associated Press)\n\nSchultz said the hiring would take place in the 75 countries where Starbucks does business, beginning at home in the United States with interpreters and others who had helped support the U.S. military abroad.\n\nSocial media users and conservative media sites quickly criticized Schultz for prioritizing refugees over unemployed homeless, veteran and black citizens in the United States.\n\nA Facebook post by the pro-Trump website \u201c100 Percent Fed Up\u201d encouraged its followers to call Starbucks and boycott the company. It was shared nearly 10,000 times.\n\nOne Twitter user, @Pamela_Moore13, said, \u201cI would rather take care of TEN homeless US veterans than 50,000 migrants/illegal aliens. How about you?\u201d\n\nA tweet from @TEN_GOP, which describes itself as the \u201cunofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans,\u201d faulted Starbucks for not helping bring down black unemployment instead. It was liked 3,000 times.\n\nThe hashtag also prompted a vigorous backlash, with people critical of the refugee ban co-opting the hashtag and saying they would go out of their way to support the company.\n\nThe debate was the latest development in a social media war between supporters and opponents of President Trump\u2019s policies, in which companies are increasingly being forced to take sides.\n\nOn Saturday evening, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, whose membership is largely Muslim and Sikh and almost universally immigrant, called for a work stoppage \u2014 including by drivers for the ride-share company Uber \u2014 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Uber tweeted that evening that surge pricing \u2014 the fare increase that typically accompanies an increase in demand \u2014 had been turned off at JFK.\n\nThe tweet was seen by many as an attempt by Uber to advertise its services and profit from the strike, and the hashtag #deleteUber quickly took off online, with people posting photos of themselves deleting the app from their phones.\n\nLyft, an Uber competitor, said the company would donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union to support its work defending detained immigrants.\n\nUber later tweeted a clarification that its earlier tweet had not been intended to break the strike, and Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, who has been under fire for agreeing to serve as an economic advisor to Trump, promised to donate $3 million for the legal defense of immigrants, but many social media users said it was too little, too late.\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
