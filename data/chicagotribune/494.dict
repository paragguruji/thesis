Since then, she married and is now the mother of two.\n\nShe's here legally on a green card, but she's been unhinged about her future since President Donald Trump took office in January and began signing travel ban orders that barred even some legal residents from entering the country. Two federal judges have blocked the bans, for now.\n\nFor the past year, Fonseca been studying English and learning American history at the Neighbors Educational Opportunities adult education program in Portage.\n\n\"It's very scary for me even though I have a green card,\" said Fonseca. \"I don't want to be deported. I'm stressed \u2026 I want to live here. My kids were born here.\"\n\nSince Trump won election last year, however, attendance in the citizenship and English language classes that aided Fonseca has declined, officials say.\n\nThey speculate they're losing students because of fears raised by Trump who's called Mexicans \"rapists\" and vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nNorthwest Indiana's declining numbers appear to mirror a national trend. Rebecca Reiner, NEO executive director, said her teachers have observed the dramatic enrollment decline of dozens of students.\n\n\"Many of our students are documented, but there's still an irrational fear,\" she said. \"Sometimes it's justified \u2026 We're very proactive in providing a safe haven for those students.\"\n\nRosella Garcia, coordinator of English language classes at the Lake County Public Library in Merrillville, said enrollment is at a record low. \"I don't know where they vanished to and I don't know what's going on, but it's concerning.\"\n\nThe library offers four English classes, based on proficiency, Monday through Wednesday.\n\nWhen a new advanced class began earlier this month, Garcia said there were just five students. \"We usually have as many as 12.\"\n\nNo one showed up for the U.S. citizenship course that began April 4. Over the years, Garcia said the library has served students from 72 different countries in the past.\n\n\"There's something going on and that's obvious \u2026 it's upsetting to me,\" said Garcia who's overseen the program for 10 years. \"Libraries have always been a safe place for people in the community and everyone is welcome to materials.\"\n\nShe said students aren't asked for documentation to take any of the classes.\n\n\"If you're just coming to attend programs, it's not necessary. We have no federal funding. Volunteers teach the classes,\" Garcia said.\n\nMeLisa Crisler, NEO adult education coordinator, said its English language and citizenship class enrollment has dropped from about 170 to 72. She said students typically come from Portage, Lake Station, Hobart, and New Chicago.\n\nEnglish teacher Amelia Boggess said she doesn't ask her students if they're citizens or not. \"Sometimes, there's a fear of being more exposed. The fear is very real the way things are now.\"\n\nGeoffrey Herren, an attorney and Valparaiso University School of Law faculty member who supervises the school's Immigration Clinic, said he's not surprised at the decline.\n\n\"There's reason to be concerned. In January, the president implemented a travel ban, which on its face even implicated green card holders,\" he said. \"It's not irrational for people to be afraid.\"\n\nSome students, already in the education pipeline, are stepping up their efforts. Leticia Munguia who teaches NEO's citizenship course, said the exam involves 10 questions covering government, economics, civil rights and more. Students study more than 100 questions to be ready.\n\nNelly Pantoja and Karina Navarro, both of Portage, are in the citizenship class now, preparing to take the test in May. They're drilled by Munguia with flashcards asking them, for example, to name two cabinet-level positions or the U.S. president during World War I.\n\nPantoja, who works in a packaging factory, said she's been the object of taunts and slurs since Trump's victory.\n\n\"I am still proud of this country. We are home,\" she said.\n\nNavarro came here seven years ago to visit family members. She met her husband in Chicago and they have two children, ages 5 and 3. \"My babies, my husband, this is my country,\" she said solemnly.\n\nMeanwhile, Fonseca passed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services examination on April 11. She will soon take the oath, joining her husband as a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"I do this for my kids,\" she said.\n\nCarole Carlson is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.\n\nForum with Mexican consulate April 29\n\nNeighbors Educational Opportunities is offering a forum in conjunction with the consulate general of Mexico, based in Chicago, from 10 a.m. to noon on April 29. The school is located at 5201 U.S. 6 in Portage.\n\nThe program will offer information about services available and answer questions about documentation and protection.", "source": "Post-Tribune", "publish_date": "2017-04-21", "authors": "Carole Carlson", "type": "article"}
