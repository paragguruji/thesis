Lawmakers from both parties, including Republican senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., spoke out against the action, and federal judges quickly ruled against parts of it.\n\nIn a joint statement, McCain and Graham said the government has a responsibility to defend its borders but must uphold \"all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.\"\n\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\" they said, adding, \"Such a hasty process risks harmful results.\"\n\nJudicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement Trump's action.\n\nThe statement, which did little to clear up the confusion and frustration playing out at airports across the globe, said the administration \"will comply with judicial orders\" even as it continues to carry out the president's order.\n\n\"Prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the statement said. \"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.\"\n\nTrump's virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants, refugees and U.S. legal residents - green-card holders - from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen. People subject to being denied entry include dual nationals, who are those born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile lawyers are still reviewing a federal court's temporary stay, administration officials said they believe it is possible for the White House to both comply with the judge's order and continue enforcing Trump's executive action. Their thinking is that the judge's order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the judge's order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place.\n\nRemarkably, the officials pointed out that while the order affects specifically deportations, the travelers currently stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States.\n\nThat interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo.\n\nJust after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \"Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!\"\n\nLater in the morning, Trump tweeted, \"Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\"\n\nThe president's aggressive action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, but also from a growing number of lawmakers in his own party.\n\n\"You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright.\n\nBut Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump's order.\n\n\"I don't want to criticize them for improving vetting,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC's \"This Week.\" He cautioned that the United States doesn't have a religious test for entry into the country, and stopped short of saying that Trump's action amounted to a Muslim ban.\n\n\"I think we need to be careful,\" McConnell said. \"We don't have religious tests in this country.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security noted that \"less than one percent\" of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \"inconvenienced\" by the executive order - though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country Saturday was one of widespread uncertainty and even chaos at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained.\n\nFederal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump's action flooded courtrooms from coast to coast.\n\nLate Saturday, a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in Virginia, Seattle and Boston.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision.\n\nNext came a temporary restraining order by District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, who blocked for seven days the removal of any green-card holders detained at Dulles International Airport. Brinkema's action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban.\n\nIn Seattle, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas S. Zilly granted an emergency stay preventing the deportation of two people had been detained at the Sea-Tac International Airport, according to the ACLU of Washington, which joined other advocates in filing an emergency motion. The two people remain in federal custody and will have a hearing later this week, the group said.\n\nJust before 2 a.m. Sunday in Boston, two federal judges ruled for two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth associate professors - Iranian nationals who are permanent legal residents in the United States - who were held at Logan International Airport when they landed after travel for an academic conference.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell", "type": "article"}
