(April Bartholomew) (April Bartholomew)\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, HIAS Pennsylvania and other immigrant rights groups and civil rights law firms denounced the travel restrictions as a full-frontal assault on immigration rights in America.\n\n\"These are dark, dark times,\" Feinberg said.\n\nThe response by elected officials on Saturday and an agreement by federal prosecutors in Philadelphia that any detainees under the order would be released gave Feinberg hope, he said. But Trump's firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday for refusing to enforce the order was fresh source of worry, he said.\n\n\"If that is the situation we are facing in federal court, I assure you as representatives of these families \u2026 we will fight,\" Feinberg said. \"We will ensure that everyone who is subjected to these immoral and intolerant practices on behalf of this new administration, that they will have a hearing in federal court.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment on the lawsuits.\n\nTrump casts the measure as a safeguard against violent Islamic extremism. The order temporarily blocks immigrants and visitors from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It does not include all countries with ties to terrorism affecting the United States, nor does it address the threat of homegrown militants.\n\nIn his first briefing with reporters since he was confirmed, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Tuesday defended Trump's order and said its intention is to keep would-be terrorists out of the United States and not serve as a ban on Muslims. Early in his campaign, Trump had called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nKelly said \"the vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States.\"\n\nThe suits filed Tuesday in Philadelphia are part of a wave of litigation over Trump's order that began rising early Saturday morning as travelers were detained at airports across the country. On Saturday, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued an injunction against enforcement of aspects of the order that applied nationwide.\n\nWashington became the first state to sue the Trump administration, with a filing Monday over the president's restrictions on refugees and immigration.\n\nSarmad Assali said she and her husband, Ghassan Assali, were confident on Friday their relatives would not be affected by the immigration restrictions because they had secured visas to emigrate to the United States as permanent residents. She said the family, Orthodox Christians, had started the process to obtain its immigrant visas in 2003.\n\nThe son of one of the men had already traveled to the United States in December on a student visa to avoid conscription into the Syrian army, she said.\n\n\"I know this is not American by the support we have received from lawyers, from people all around the world,\" Assali said.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney spoke about his efforts to speak with those detained at the airport Saturday. He said the Customs and Border Patrol agents were under orders from the Trump administration not to allow anyone to have access to the detainees.\n\nKenney lauded the civil rights and immigration lawyers who have been working since Saturday to ensure those affected by the executive order are represented.\n\n\"The cold and callous nature of this administration's approach to this is really disappointing to me as an American,\" Kenney said.\n\nThe suit on behalf of Basam Assali and his wife, Jozfin, and Hassan Assali and his wife, Jurjeet, and their two children says the families were detained as soon as their plane reached the gate in Philadelphia at 7:45 a.m. Saturday. They asked customs officials to contact Ghassan Assali, who was waiting in the airport, but were refused, the suit says.\n\nCustoms officers said they could reboard the plane for the return flight or they would be arrested, imprisoned and lose their visas, and with them the ability to return to the United States for five years, according to the lawsuit. They believed the customs officers were saying that if they returned to Syria, they could return to the United States in 90 days, but exactly what they were told is unclear because none of the travelers is fluent in English and no interpreter was provided, the suit alleges.\n\nJonathan Grode, an attorney who the Assali family contacted after learning from immigration officials that her family would not be permitted to enter the country, noted that the families were not refugees, but immigrants sponsored by their family who are U.S. citizens.\n\n\"These are not people seeking asylum. They were not seeking any sort of relief other than the ability to arrive in the United States based on a bona fide family-based filing,\" Grode said.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Peter Hall", "type": "article"}
