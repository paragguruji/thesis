As some of the orders block deportation, that left individual officers to try and figure out which priorities to honor.\n\nIn the chaos, Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans waved red flags on Sunday, warning the administration to slow down and make sure the tough new rules were implemented with deliberation.\n\nU.S. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) blasted the Trump executive order for what they said was a \u201chasty\u201d implementation.\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results,\u201d the senators said. \u201cWe should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\u201d\n\nTrump fired back with a late-afternoon tweet, saying their statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that they are \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Democrats will introduce legislation as soon as Monday to stop the president\u2019s actions. House Democrats are taking similar legislative action, and lawmakers from both chambers will rally Monday evening at the Supreme Court to protest Trump's orders.\n\n\"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" said Schumer, the New York Democrat, choking up as he stood with immigrants and refugees at a news conference Sunday. \"It must be reversed immediately.\"\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats are exploring legal options, including an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the actions. But the chances of passing a bill through the Republican-controlled Congress are slim, as most GOP leaders and lawmakers have not objected to Trump's ban.\n\nWhite House officials on Sunday defended the Trump plan, insisting he took great care in crafting it. If the announcement came as a surprise to many, they say, that was by design. The White House did not want to tell too many people about it in advance, thinking that too much notice would compromise the strategy, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said.\n\n\u201cThe people that needed to know, knew,\u201d he said Sunday on ABC. \u201cThe appropriate leadership was notified.\u201d\n\nStill the confusion over the particulars was significant \u2014 especially on the question of the green cards. In explaining the new order, administration officials on Saturday told reporters that the green card holders from the seven banned countries would have to get waivers in order to return to the U.S. after traveling outside the country.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity to reporters on Saturday, the White House official said green card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the U.S. would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S., according to a pool reporter who was present. Those green card holders in the United States would have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, the official said.\n\nOn Sunday, Priebus said otherwise.\n\n\u201cAs far as green card holders, moving forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d Priebus told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in an interview, adding that border officials still retain \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to hold people from the suspect countries before letting them enter the U.S.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Christi Parsons, Lisa Mascaro", "type": "article"}
