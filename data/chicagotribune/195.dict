Will they be allowed to stay?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-travel-ban-refugees-20170628-story.html", "text": "Since being approved two weeks ago to fly to the United States as a refugee, Shaz Sadiq has read her Bible and prayed nightly that nothing goes wrong.\n\nShe fled her native Pakistan \u2014 where her father had been killed in a church shooting and she had received frequent death threats \u2014 in 2013 and has spent the last four years in Bangkok, Thailand, applying for refugee status and permanent resettlement in a place safe for Christians.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a miracle. And every day feels like a year,\u201d said Sadiq, 42, who is scheduled to arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport the afternoon of July 6 with her sister and mother.\n\nSadiq, who has no relatives in the United States and has never been in the country, could be among the last refugees of her kind admitted to the U.S. \u2014 at least for a while \u2014 now that the Supreme Court has revived President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nWith exceptions for people with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to schools, employers, family or other U.S. entities, the ban going into effect Thursday will block admissions of people from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days as the government evaluates its vetting procedures.\n\nPakistan is not on that list. But the travel order also bans refugees from all countries for 120 days.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants and refugees have been struggling to interpret the court\u2019s less-than-clear language on who is exempt from the new travel rules and say that the federal government has caused confusion by not releasing guidelines on which refugees it will accept.\n\nThe State Department is studying how to define \u201cbona fide relationship,\u201d spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week. Refugees already en route \u2014 whether they have a bona fide relationship to the U.S. or not \u2014 would be allowed into the U.S. through July 6.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, we don't know,\u201d Nauert said.\n\nSadiq said she\u2019s confident she and her family members will be able to start their new lives. She hopes to find work as a translator, her profession in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThis restriction is not for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make it.\u201d\n\nBut a representative of the resettlement agency helping her family, the International Rescue Committee, said he\u2019s less sure because her scheduled arrival comes at the brink of the deadline. A small delay on either of her two flights could push her over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident this family will make it in,\u201d said Ruben Chandrasekar, a regional director for the organization in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\n\u201cA lot will depend on the exact guidance we get from the State Department,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are friendly, polite women. We want to live our own lives. We are not going to be a bother. \u2014 Shaz Sadiq\n\nSadiq is being resettled with his office because she knows an employee of the organization in the Washington area for whom she did translation work in Pakistan. But that kind of relationship may not be enough to pass government muster should she arrive late or local officials decide to apply their own discretion, Chandrasekar said.\n\n\u201cThis family has no family member connection in the area, so that also makes it harder to make a case if we have to,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 40% of refugees in the U.S. arrive with no family in the country. And because of their status as refugees, they tend to not have the kind of job or university connection other immigrants could use to bypass the ban.\n\nRefugee groups have argued that people who have been connected to resettlement agencies in the U.S. \u2014 a requirement to resettle \u2014 should be able to count those agencies as U.S. connections for travel purposes.\n\nPeople with bona fide ties should include \u201canyone who has an existing relationship with a nonprofit, frankly tens of thousands of refugees,\u201d said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. The organization is among those whose lawsuit against the travel ban the Supreme Court will consider in the fall.\n\nBut the State Department, the main federal agency that handles refugee resettlement, hasn\u2019t weighed in on that question.\n\nOn Thursday, Muslim Advocates, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Americans United for Separation of Church and State \u2014 all opponents of the travel ban \u2014 sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly asking for \u201cimmediate guidance\u201d on how it will be implemented.\n\nJustin Cox, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, questioned whether immigration authorities are receiving clear guidance. \u201cIf they are violating what the Supreme Court said, we can and will go back to the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates are hoping for a smoother rollout of the travel ban than what happened with the original version of the ban, which included green card holders being blocked and tens of thousands of visas being canceled amid confusion at U.S. airports and embassies across the world. That ban included a preference for refugees who were religious minorities in their countries, including Christians such as Sadiq.\n\nThough Sadiq, her sister, Rahila, and their mother, Doris, passed a vetting process that took years, they plan to celebrate only after passing customs agents and stepping foot on American soil.\n\n\u201cOur heart is dead with so many things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have excitement. Maybe we will once we get to America.\u201d\n\nShe said she hopes that anti-immigrant views in the U.S. won\u2019t affect her family.\n\n\u201cIf you have a guest in your house and the guest does not follow the rules, you have to understand if the guest has problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are not troublemakers. We are friendly, polite women. We want to live our own lives. We are not going to be a bother.\u201d\n\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.
