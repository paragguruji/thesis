He merely described Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban of seven Muslim-majority countries as \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 new center fielder gave a candid answer at a time when we need more understanding and less silence.\n\n\u201cThe question was asked out of empathy toward my family,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cI appreciate that. If anybody is asking about my family, then I\u2019m going to let them know. Obviously it affected my family. My wife\u2019s Iranian.\u201d\n\nFowler\u2019s wife, Aliya, emigrated from Iran with her parents when she was 5 years old. She\u2019s a U.S. citizen, but her grandparents and extended family still live in Iran.\n\nFowler\u2019s comments on the travel ban elicited an array of responses, and many of the nastiest comments were posted on the \u201cSt. Louis Cardinals True Fans\u201d Facebook page.\n\nFowler acknowledged his detractors on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWelp,\u201d Fowler wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cSince I have a nice little chunk of people who hate me cuz I have an opinion, I\u2019m going to do a nice giveaway for the good people.\u201d\n\nWhen others would have lashed out, Fowler showed his character and taught us all a lesson by responding to the hate with kindness.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t apologize for acknowledging how the proposed travel ban would affect his wife and their daughter, Naya, 3.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to care for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a question is asked out of concern, I\u2019m going to answer the question. I\u2019m going to answer it truthfully. It\u2019s not hurt anybody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my perspective. It\u2019s unfortunate that people think of things like that way. I believe they\u2019re sensitive. I\u2019m not the sensitive one.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-21", "authors": "Jose De Jesus Ortiz", "type": "article"}
