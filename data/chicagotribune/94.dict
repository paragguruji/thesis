Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nThe Pushback at LAX, SFO, DFW, JFK, BOS \u2026 and Worldwide\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order to block travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations (read it here) triggered confusion, fear and anger around the U.S. Protesters, including thousands at LAX, and attorneys gathered at airports to try to force the release of detainees. Federal judges intervened. Some travelers, like this 75-year-old Iranian grandmother, talked of their ordeals. For one group, the order proved particularly infuriating: American veterans who relied on Iraqi interpreters on their tours of duty. \u201cThis is not what we fought for,\u201d said one. So they did something about it.\n\nBrian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Protesters block traffic at Los Angeles International Airport. Protesters block traffic at Los Angeles International Airport.

Over the weekend, Trump made the unusual move of adding them to his National Security Council while limiting the attendance of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. Officials said Bannon and Miller played a key role in the travel ban order \u2014 the clearest sign yet they intend to reshape the country.\n\nThe Misery and Humanity of the Syrian Refugees\n\nWhen President Trump slammed the door shut on Syrian refugees last week, he no doubt eviscerated the hopes of many people fleeing one of the most brutal conflicts since World War II. The Times\u2019 correspondents traveled across the globe to paint portraits of a people scattered from Sweden to Brazil. Read this heart-wrenching piece about a mother separated from ailing twins. And see the entire series here.\n\nThe Onetime \u2018Do-Nothing Congress\u2019 Deals With a New Reality\n\nRepublicans in Congress may have expressed their desire to work hand in hand with Trump. Instead, they\u2019ve been complaining about Trump forging ahead without them, much as they did with President Obama. The difference was that with Trump, it was mostly quiet kvetching \u2014 until the new refugee policy crossed the line for some. How will Congress adjust?\n\nWhy Police Don\u2019t Want to Do ICE\u2019s Job\n\nTrump has called for empowering local law enforcement to take on the duties of immigration agents. The L.A.-area police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies our reporters talked to, including some officers who voted for Trump, said it\u2019s not their job. Many added that it would make policing more difficult by sowing distrust and discouraging witnesses and victims to talk.\n\nMore About Immigration\n\n-- Are you an immigrant? We want to hear what you think of Trump\u2019s orders. We have already lots of reactions, including how L.A.\u2019s Iranian American community is responding.\n\n-- Trump's refugee policy raises a question: How do you tell a Christian from a Muslim?\n\n-- Why not just build a wall? The logistics of doing so along the shifting Rio Grande in Texas have vexed officials and residents for years.\n\nHollywood Searches Its Soul\n\nHollywood\u2019s awards season has long been a soapbox for political causes, and in some respects, this year is no different. Over the weekend, many spoke out against Trump during the Sundance Film Festival, Producers Guild Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards (more about that below). But as we get closer to the Oscars, there\u2019s a debate going on too about whether speaking out can be counterproductive. Does it reinforce the idea that Hollywood lives in a bubble \u2014 and distract from making one\u2019s art?\n\nOUR MUST-READS FROM THE WEEKEND\n\n-- The uncensored Trump repeatedly interrupted the more sober one in the first week.\n\n-- A celebration of female filmmakers triggered a heated debate about gender and race among Salma Hayek, Jessica Williams and Shirley MacLaine.\n\n-- Imagine running a multibillion-dollar industry and having to do everything in cash. The perils of the legal cannabis business.\n\n-- A feud over a text message ended with the fatal shooting of a teen. But was it really murder?
