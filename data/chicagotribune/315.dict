The firing, in a written statement released just hours after Yates went public with her concerns, also served as a warning to other administration officials that Trump is prepared to terminate those who refuse to carry out his orders.\n\nYates' refusal to defend the executive order was largely symbolic given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, will almost certainly defend the policy once he's sworn in. He's expected to be confirmed Tuesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee and could be approved within days by the full Senate.\n\nYet the firing reflected the mounting conflict over the executive order, as administration officials have moved to distance themselves from the policy and even some of Trump's top advisers have made clear that they were not consulted on its implementation.\n\nPresident Trump fired acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates on Jan. 30, just hours after she announced that the Justice Department would not defend his controversial executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from certain countries.

She said in a memo Monday she was not convinced it was lawful or consistent with the agency's obligation \"to stand for what is right.\"\n\nTrump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, soon followed with a statement accusing Yates of having \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\" Trump named longtime federal prosecutor Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, as Yates' replacement. Boente was sworn in privately late Monday, the White House said, and rescinded Yates' directive.\n\nThe chain of events bore echoes of the Nixon-era \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" when the attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned rather than follow an order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. The prosecutor, Archibald Cox, was fired by the solicitor general.\n\nYates, a holdover from the Obama administration who was the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta and later became Loretta Lynch's deputy, was not alone in her misgivings.\n\nAt least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of the directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order from the media.\n\nTrump's order pauses America's entire refugee program for four months, indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria and temporarily freezes immigration from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Federal judges in New York and several other states issued orders that temporarily block the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Trump's travel ban took effect and found themselves in limbo.\n\nYates on Monday said that she had reviewed the policy and concluded that it was at odds with the Justice Department's mission. She said that though other lawyers in the department had reviewed the order, their review had not addressed whether it was \"wise or just.\"\n\n\"I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\" Yates wrote in a letter.\n\nTrump said the order had been \"approved\" by Justice Department lawyers. However, the department has said the Office of Legal Counsel review was limited to whether the order was properly drafted, but did not address broader policy questions.\n\nEvan Vucci / AP Dana Boente, seen here in 2012, was named by President Donald Trump as acting attorney general on January 30, 2017.

A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump's order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president's political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order.\n\nU.S. officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet's thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials' private views.\n\nDespite his public defense of the policy, the president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. But he's also blamed the media \u2014 his frequent target \u2014 for what he believes are reports exaggerating the dissent and the number of people actually affected.\n\nAfter a chaotic weekend during which some U.S. legal permanent residents were detained at airports, some agencies were moving swiftly to try to clean up after the White House.\n\nHomeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries.\n\n\"There are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers in Trump's party sought to distance themselves from the wide-ranging order.\n\nWhile Spicer said \"appropriate committees and leadership offices\" on Capitol Hill were consulted, GOP lawmakers said their offices had no hand in drafting the order and no briefings from the White House on how it would work.\n\n\"I think they know that it could have been done in a better way,\" Corker said of the White House.\n\nAssociated Press", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Tribune news services", "type": "article"}
