A highly skilled postdoctoral applicant from Iran who had intended to come to the U.S. to do research is now going to Canada instead. Trump\u2019s policy of unjustified bigotry is thus directly hurting medical research in the United States.\n\nFor those Trump supporters who do not believe in science, perhaps this is not troubling. However, for those who do believe, for example, in the germ theory of disease and who appreciate having a life span nearly twice as long as existed in the era before modern science, this is a problem.\n\n\u2014 Thomas E.
