The Association of American Medical Colleges projects the U.S. will have a shortage of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors by 2025.\n\n\"There's a concern that if the environment is not viewed as welcoming for you as an immigrant ... if the feeling is 'thanks-but-no-thanks,' they're going to look to other countries,\" Grover said.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Friday it was suspending expedited review in order to focus on processing \"long-pending petitions\" for H-1B visas that it has been unable to get to because it's been so busy.\n\nSome, however, question whether other factors may be at play.\n\nJeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said the suspension may be a response to political pressure to do something about the H-1B system. And it may backfire.\n\n\"In reality it will affect many employers and probably put the administration at odds with employers of immigrants,\" Batalova said.\n\nThe majority of H-1B visas go to the technology sector, but universities, research institutions, manufacturers and financial services companies also will be affected.\n\nExpedited approvals have been suspended before, but those earlier suspensions generally did not apply to most doctors and academic medical center workers, said Chicago immigration attorney Kristen Harris.\n\nAlexia Elejalde-Ruiz contributed.\n\nlschencker@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @lschencker", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Lisa Schencker", "type": "article"}
