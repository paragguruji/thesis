Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) told reporters.\n\n\"The chairman will either need to decide if he's leading an investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House. Because he cannot do both,\" Schiff said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n\nThe assessment, even if delivered in Schiff's typically understated fashion, reflected a potential breakdown in what is traditionally a nonpartisan partnership between the top Republican and Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\n\nIt was all the more striking given that both men have served together for more than a decade in the same state congressional delegation.\n\nSchiff said he raised his concerns directly with Nunes after the Republican disclosed new information publicly and then to the White House. He stopped short of saying whether Nunes was improperly making classified information public, saying instead that his actions were \"beyond irregular.\"\n\nNunes' actions further demonstrated the need for an independent inquiry into Russia's actions during the campaign, Schiff said.\n\n\"We're the only investigation there is. If we don't do it, no one is going to do it,\" Schiff said. \"Now, perhaps the White House would like it that way. But the American people, I think, want there to be a credible investigation. And if we're not going to conduct it, then we need to have an independent commission do it.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": "Michael A.
