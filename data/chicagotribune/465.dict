Around 8:20 p.m., protesters streamed into the baggage claim area and started chanting \u201cDHS, set them free.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, President Trump signed an order that indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering the United States, banned refugees from other countries for 120 days and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S from seven majority Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 until more \u201cextreme vetting\u201d can be figured out.\n\nIn its wake, protests broke out at airports across the country where people affected by the order were being taken into custody. Officials said no travelers in San Diego had been detained since the order.\n\nNancee Lewis / San Diego Union-Tribune More than 1,000 San Diegans protest at Lindbergh Field after President Donald Trump's recent travel ban.

(Nancee Lewis / San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nOrganizers of Sunday\u2019s demonstration said it was an opportunity for San Diegans to come together to show support for Muslims and other oppressed groups.\n\n\u201cIt is refreshing and warms my heart to see so many people coming out and getting involved to tell Donald Trump that this ban is unconstitutional and unjust,\u201d said 22-year-old Mohamed Abdallah, who helped organize Sunday\u2019s gathering.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s crowd, dressed in a black headscarf, was Asha Mohamed, who emigrated from Somalia to the United States when she was 3 years old. She heard about the protest on Facebook and decided to attend with her sisters and friends.\n\nThe group was carrying a poster that read, \u201cNo hate, no bigotry, no Muslim registry.\u201d She said her parents worked multiple jobs to put her and her sisters through college.\n\nShe said Sunday\u2019s protest felt like history in the making.\n\n\u201cThis country was built on immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is it OK to ban people when all they want is a better life and to create a better life for their families.\u201d\n\nShe said when she looked out at the sea of people who came to protest \u2014 young and old and of many different backgrounds \u2014 she sees the America she came to as a child.\n\nTwitter: @LAWinkley\n\n(619) 293-1546\n\nlyndsay.winkley@sduniontribune.com", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Lyndsay Winkley", "type": "article"}
