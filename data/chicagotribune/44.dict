Search demand from the seven predominantly Muslim countries included in the travel ban \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 was down 33 percent, but China, Ireland, Denmark and New Zealand all saw comparable declines.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, flight searches from Russia to the U.S. have skyrocketed, up 88 percent under Trump's travel ban.\n\n\"There were a few places where search traffic was up, and Russia was definitely the biggest,\" Surry said.\n\nThe executive order, which the White House said was intended to protect the U.S. from foreign terrorists, temporarily barred entry for people from the seven Muslim-majority countries. It also suspended resettlement in the U.S. of refugees from around the world.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle blocked the immigration order Feb. 3, a decision unanimously upheld by a federal appeals court Feb. 9. Trump said Thursday that next week he will announce \"a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people.\"\n\nBusiness travel declined 3.4 percent in the week after the travel ban was rolled out, resulting in $185 million in lost bookings, according to the Global Business Travel Association, an international trade group based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe real costs could be much higher, said Michael McCormick, the group's executive director and chief operating officer.\n\n\"We clearly see the impact, and it hurts,\" McCormick said. \"There's a direct link between business travel expenditure and economic growth.\"\n\nThe association's study is based on bookings done by companies in the U.S. but reflects travel in both directions. The group is collecting data from European companies on travel to the U.S., McCormick said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw ultimately a similar or worse impact on travel coming into the United States,\" he said.\n\nMichael Fassnacht, CEO and president of FCB Chicago, said international business travel continues unabated for the advertising agency but with added support, including a new 24/7 legal hotline for employees abroad.\n\n\"Because there is some nervousness for some of our employees who are immigrants and on H-1B visas, we are trying everything to provide support and assistance to them,\" Fassnacht said. \"We want to help our employees feel good and safe about traveling \u2014 for leisure or for business.\"\n\nFassnacht, a native of Germany, holds a green card and is in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. He is traveling to South Africa next week on business, and his mom just came to visit from Germany.\n\n\"It's more important than ever before (to travel internationally) to show that nothing has changed,\" Fassnacht said.\n\nIn Chicago, where tourism is on the rise but overseas travel lags other major U.S. destinations, the impact of the ban may be more muted.\n\nChicago is coming off a record year for tourism, with 54.1 million visitors in 2016, according to Choose Chicago, the city's tourism arm. But international tourism was down 3.7 percent to 1.56 million visitors, with the biggest declines from the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Brazil.\n\n\"We don't really have any idea of how this ban would potentially impact travel plans,\" said Al Orendorff, a spokesman for Choose Chicago. \"We can't speculate on what the future will hold.\"\n\nSince Trump's 90-day affecting U.S. entries from seven Muslim-majority countries took effect, several federal courts have issued emergency stays against portions of the executive order and dozens of lawsuits were filed against it.
