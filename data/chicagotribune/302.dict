Brinkema's action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban.\n\nTrump's order reverberated across the world Saturday, making it increasingly clear that the measure he had promised during his presidential campaign was casting a wider net than even his opponents had feared.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrant advocates mounted throughout the day as travelers from the Middle East were detained at U.S. airports or sent home. A lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump's executive action, which was signed Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants.\n\nBut as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who were abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the United States are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from U.S. allies, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nThe virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions from not only Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Canada announced it would accept asylum applications from U.S. green-card holders.\n\nYet Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and impose what became known as his \"Muslim ban,'' was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it.\n\n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nIn New York, Donnelly seemed to have little patience for the government's arguments, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the lawsuit had already been released.\n\nDonnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \"Our own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\" she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days prior, those detained would have been granted admission without question.\n\nDuring the hearing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he had received word of a deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU's request.\n\nA senior Department of Homeland Security official had no comment about the rulings late Saturday and said the department was consulting with its lawyers.\n\nCraig Ruttle / AP Protesters assemble at John F.

All had been in transit when Trump signed the order, and some had already departed the United States on flights by late Saturday while others were still being detained awaiting flights. Also, 173 people had not been allowed to board U.S.-bound planes at foreign airports.\n\nThe official said that officers doing case-by-case reviews had granted 81 waivers so far to green-card holders.\n\nDHS began implementing the president's order immediately after he signed it, according to the official. He declined to say whether the department had an operational plan ready at that time.\n\nThough several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the majority remained silent, and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign. \"This is not a religious test, and it is not a ban on people of any religion,'' Ryan said Saturday. \"This order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world.\"\n\nThe president's order, signed Friday, suspends admission to the United States of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations - notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia - where the Trump Organization, now run by the president's adult sons, is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism.\n\nAccording to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of terrorism concerns. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering powerful and wealthy majority-Muslim allies, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAmid widespread confusion on Saturday about how the order will be enforced, some administration officials acknowledged that its rollout had been chaotic. Officials tried to reassure travelers and their families, pointing out that green-card holders in the United States will not be affected and noting that the DHS is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a security threat. It can take years for someone to become a green-card holder, or lawful permanent resident authorized to permanently live and work in the country.", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Jerry Markon, Emma Brown, Katherine Shaver", "type": "article"}
