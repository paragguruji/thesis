But unlike the last ban, the restrictions vary from place to place, and countries that increase their cooperation and information-sharing with the United States might be able to find their way off the list.\n\nFor Syria and North Korea, the president's proclamation blocks immigrants wanting to relocate to the United States and non-immigrants wishing to visit in some capacity. For Iran, the proclamation blocks both immigrants and non-immigrants, though it exempts students and those participating in a cultural exchange.\n\nThe proclamation blocks people from Chad, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States as immigrants or on business or tourist visas, and it blocks people from Somalia from coming as immigrants. The proclamation names Venezuela, but it only blocks certain government officials.\n\nA Washington Post review of State Department data found that more than 65,000 visas were issued in fiscal 2016 that would now likely fall under the ban. The ban, though, contains a robust list of people who might qualify for a case-by-case exception, including for those with significant U.S. contacts or those wanting to visit close family members.\n\nThe ban, too, exempts those already admitted to the United States on the effective date of the proclamation \u2014 which, for those not affected by the previous travel ban, is Oct. 18.\n\nThe Supreme Court had been set to hear arguments on Trump's previous travel ban, inked in March, but on Monday it removed that hearing from the calendar and asked for briefs on whether the case was now moot.\n\nOne significant piece of the previous executive order \u2014 the 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States \u2014 remains in effect until Oct. 24. The latest ban leaves unclear what will happen after that. U.S. officials have been discussing possibly lowering the refugee cap for fiscal 2018 to below 50,000. The fiscal year begins Oct. 1.\n\nMany legal observers think the new directive will make moot the court's examination of the second executive order. While the court's three most conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 would have allowed Trump's order to go into effect as written, the rest of the court has looked for a middle ground.\n\n\"It's hard to see how the court will have much appetite to decide\" the merits of the dispute with a new order in place, Kannon Shanmugam, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who argues frequently before the court, said last week.\n\nIn their initial briefs, lawyers for challengers of the executive order \u2014 immigrant groups and the state of Hawaii \u2014 as well as the Justice Department argued that the case was not moot. Those arguments came before the latest order was issued, but with an awareness that the ban could expire before the court heard the case. After the new proclamation was released, Solicitor General Noel Francisco suggested to the justices that they order new briefings from the parties about how it affected the case.\n\nOpponents of the ban were largely mum on what the legal path forward would be.\n\n\"It does continue to injure our current plaintiffs,\" said Justin Cox, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nTo establish the new ban, U.S. officials conducted a worldwide review of the information countries were able to provide on their travelers wanting to come to the United States.\n\nInitially, 16 countries were deemed inadequate, and 31 were at risk of becoming inadequate, authorities said. U.S. officials then negotiated with foreign counterparts, ultimately producing a list of eight countries that were either unable or unwilling to provide the information the United States wanted.\n\nSudan was dropped from the ban list, and its removal is noteworthy in part because it is one of just three countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. The other two, Iran and Syria, remain on the travel ban list.\n\nChad, North Korea and Venezuela were added. Those in Chad, in particular, seemed surprised.\n\n\"The reaction has been astonishment and then indignation,\" said Nour Ibedou, director of the Chadian Human Rights Association. \"We do not understand how our country achieved this lack of trust from the United States.\"\n\nAdministration officials can now point to Venezuela and North Korea as being non-Muslim majority countries on the banned list - perhaps undercutting the argument of opponents that the measure is meant to fulfill Trump's campaign promise of a Muslim ban. But ban opponents note that the restrictions on Venezuela affect only government officials, and few people from North Korea travel to the United States.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the new ban was an \"unfounded strategy\" against the South American country.\n\n\"We're looking for dialogue, we're looking for channels,\" he said. \"We have to stop the madness and irrationality.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "authors": "Matt Zapotosky,\u00a0Robert Barnes and\u00a0Devlin Barrett", "type": "article"}
