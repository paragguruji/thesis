Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Gorsuch made the comments during their private meeting Wednesday, and the account was confirmed by Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding the judge through his confirmation process.\n\nTrump on Wednesday morning declared that an appeals court's hearing Tuesday night regarding his controversial immigration executive order was \"disgraceful,\" and that judges were more concerned about politics than following the law.\n\nThe remarks followed earlier tweets from Trump disparaging \"the so-called judge\" who issued a nationwide stop to his plan and saying the ruling \"put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system.\"\n\nBlumenthal said Gorsuch, whom Trump nominated to the Supreme Court just over a week ago, agreed with him that the president's language was out of line.\n\n\"I told him how abhorrent Donald Trump's invective and insults are towards the judiciary. And he said to me that he found them 'disheartening' and 'demoralizing' - his words,\" Blumenthal said in an interview.\n\nGorsuch \"stated very emotionally and strongly his belief in his fellow judges' integrity and the principle of judicial independence,\" he added. \"And I made clear to him that that belief requires him to be stronger and more explicit, more public in his views.\"\n\nThe contretemps added another layer to the roiling nature of Trump's young presidency. Some historians wondered if Supreme Court nominees had ever separated themselves in such a way from the president who nominated them; others tried to recall if a president had ever given a nominee reason to do so.\n\nLess than three weeks after taking the oath of office, Trump already has a legal dispute that seems likely to arrive soon at the Supreme Court. His comments about the judiciary seem far beyond the more veiled criticism presidents usually lob at the branch, and Democrats have pointed to those comments in arguing for a close examination of Gorsuch, who has served for 10 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\nWithin hours of Blumenthal's revelation of Gorsuch's remarks, there were questions about how Trump, famously thin-skinned about criticism, would receive his nominee's words. There was a competing theory that they were a calculated attempt by Gorsuch to assert his independence.\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a group promoting Gorsuch's nomination, said the judge's remarks simply confirmed what those close to Gorsuch already knew.\n\n\"He's always been a person independent of the president, and it was shown by his statement,\" she said.\n\nThose on the left, meanwhile, said Gorsuch would need to do more than that.\n\n\"Is Gorsuch distancing himself from Trump? As we say on the Internet: LOL,\" Drew Courtney of People for the American Way said in a statement. \"To be clear: Donald Trump's pattern of attacks on federal judges is more than demoralizing - it's a threat to the separation of powers and our constitutional system, and it's hard to imagine a more tepid response than to call them 'disheartening.' \"\n\nTrump has been on a days-long crusade against the judicial branch since U.S. District Judge James Robart of Seattle halted the administration's executive order temporarily halting the U.S. refugee program and barring entry to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is deliberating whether Trump's executive order should be allowed to continue.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at the Major Cities Chiefs Association Winter Conference in Washington, Trump said he listened to the oral arguments at the appeals court and was disappointed at what he heard.\n\n\"I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won't call it biased,\" Trump told the group. \"But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right.\"\n\nTrump said the arguments were \"disgraceful\" because his executive order \"can't be written any plainer or better and for us to be going through this\" - he paused to mention that a judge in Boston had ruled to allow the order to continue.\n\nTrump said the courts were standing in the way of what he was elected to do and that even \"a bad student in high school student\" would support his policies.\n\n\"We want security,\" he said. \"One of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security. It's one of the reasons I was elected . . . And they're taking away our weapons, one by one. That's what they're doing. And you know it and I know it.\"\n\nThe panel of 9th Circuit judges questioned whether the administration had any evidence of increased risk that would warrant the new restrictions, and whether the restrictions violated the law and the Constitution's protections against religious discrimination.\n\nTrump's comments were the latest escalation in a worsening dispute between the executive branch and the judiciary that the president has personally carried out on social media and in public remarks. While it is not new for a president to disagree with the actions of another branch of government, Trump's crusade against the federal judiciary comes before the legal process has fully played out and is unusual for its threatening tone and use of personal invective.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that the president is expressing his frustration with a process that he believes should be subject to common sense.\n\n\"He respects the judiciary,\" Spicer said. \"It's hard for him and for a lot of people to understand how something so clear in the law can be so misinterpreted.\"", "source": "chicagotribune.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "Abby Phillip, Robert Barnes, Ed O'Keefe", "type": "article"}
