Most people don\u2019t know that because it didn\u2019t get covered,\u2019\u2019 Conway said.\n\nConway tweeted Friday morning that she meant to say \u201cBowling Green terrorists\u201d during the interview. She hasn't, however, corrected her characterization of Obama\u2019s 2011 policy.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

That government did slow down the processing for Iraqi\u2019s being issued Special Immigrant Visas, which are given to translators and interpreters who worked with the U.S. in that country.\n\nThat slow-down was prompted by the May 2011 arrest of two men in Kentucky charged with plotting to send weapons and money to al-Qaida operatives. Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were mistakenly admitted to the U.S. as Iraqi refugees in 2009 and resettled in Bowling Green, Kentucky.\n\nAlwan and Hammadi are in prison after pleading guilty. They were never accused of plotting to launch attacks inside the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConway\u2019s comments have made fodder for jokes among social media users. \u2018\u2018Bowling Green massacre\u2019\u2019 quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter with a flurry of tweets mourning the nonexistent victims.\n\nThe website BowlingGreenMassacreFund.com appeared online Friday.
