Rooney knows the words of welcome she\u2019ll write on it, in the teen\u2019s native language from the African country of Eritrea.\n\nBut Rooney\u2019s family is leaving the sign blank, for now. She and her husband, Todd Rooney, fear actually writing the words \u2018\u2018Welcome Home\u2019\u2019 could break her heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe foster son they\u2019re waiting for is part of a small, three-decade-old US program for so-called unaccompanied refugee minors that has been halted by a series of new refugee bans and travel limits imposed by the Trump administration in the name of fighting terrorism.\n\nThe US travel bans have stranded more than 100 refugee children who were already matched to waiting American foster families. Without parents or other adult relatives, those kids are living on their own in countries of temporary refuge, in limbo while their US foster parents hope for a court ruling that will allow the children to finish their journeys.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

The children must then pass US security screenings and meet other requirements and win a match with an American foster family or group home.\n\nBut Trump administration orders and court rulings interpreting them are now barring refugees with no close family in the United States.\n\nThe child refugees newly blocked include five Ethiopian sisters, ages 9 to 16. The girls lost both parents in 2009 and have faced abuse in the war zone of neighboring South Sudan and in Sudanese cities, said Jessica Jones, policy counsel for the Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Along with the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Lutherans are one of two US groups running the program on behalf of the State Department.\n\nIn San Francisco, Web designer Julie Rajagopal and husband, Mike Gougherty, a senior planner for a regional ferry system, are two of the lucky ones. The 16-year-old they are fostering also fled forced military service in Eritrea, at 13. When he landed in March, he was among the last refugee foster children to make it into the United States. On a summer day, the teen strolled with the couple in a San Francisco park.\n\nIn Michigan, the Rooneys stack clothes in the room they set aside for the eagerly awaited new family member. Tianna Rooney recently got out the poster board; after a concerned look from her husband, she put it away. \u2018\u2018We want to think positive thoughts,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But without . . . setting ourselves up for a heartache.\u2019\u2019", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-30", "type": "article"}
