But Baker is one of many elected officials in Massachusetts who stated their opposition to Trump\u2019s order, including Mayor Martin J. Walsh, US Representative Seth Moulton, and US senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

He said \u201ca lot more Marines that I served with would have died\u201d without assistance from Iraqi translators and intelligence sources.\n\n\u201cThey kept us from being killed and they helped us find our enemies,\u201d Moulton said during a phone interview Saturday afternoon. \u201cThese are people who have put their lives on the line for not just their countries but ours. The least we owe them is a chance to keep on living.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a pretty dangerous situation,\u201d said Moulton, an outspoken Trump critic who likened the president\u2019s campaign to Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise. \u201cWhat Americans need to realize is that this absolutely puts out national security and our troops on the front line in danger.\u201d\n\nMoulton said one of his own Iraqi translators, from Najaf, just moved to the United States \u201ca month or two ago. Thank God he got here before Trump got into office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoulton, who served under General James Mattis when the latter commanded the First Marine Division in Iraq, backed his nomination to become Trump\u2019s defense secretary. But the congressman said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that Mattis stood alongside Trump as the president signed the executive order on Friday.\n\nMoulton said he was confident that Mattis privately opposes the measure. \u201cBut General Mattis knows better\u201d than to lend his tacit approval by appearing at the signing, he said.\n\nWarren urged Trump via Twitter to rescind the executive order and stand behind refugees from the affected countries.\n\nShe also noted that Friday was Holocaust Remembrance Day, a reminder of what can happen when people remain silent.\n\n\u201cTurning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nMarkey said on Twitter Saturday afternoon that he will fight Trump\u2019s \u201cimmoral Muslim ban\u201d that could affect the Bay State.\n\nMassachusetts \u201cthrives from the diversity of our immigrant community \u2014 in universities, business, and workforce,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIsolation harms our economy and families.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s opposition to the order is far from his first break with Trump. In December 2015, after Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the country, Baker swiped at him.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s ridiculous, and I would never support a policy like that,\u201d he told reporters at the time. \u201cI have no idea what the motivation is on that. First of all, it\u2019s unrealistic. Secondly, it\u2019s inappropriate. And third, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nGlobe correspondent Mina Corpuz contributed to this report.
