Criminal hearings cannot be broadcast at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ninth Circuit is one of the few appeals courts in the country that chose to adjust their local rules to allow the broadcasting of hearings, and extended those privileges to local district courts, though the hearings are typically recorded and broadcast at a later time.\n\nThe decision to broadcast today\u2019s hearing live came after US District Judge James L. Robart broadcast a hearing in Seattle on Friday at the request of the state of Washington. During that hearing, Robart granted a temporary restraining order effectively halting Trump\u2019s execution action that temporarily banned people from seven predominately Muslim countries from entering the US.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Gorton had rejected without explanation a request by The Boston Globe to similarly broadcast a hearing in Boston on whether to extend a temporary restraining order that had been granted here a week earlier.\n\nGorton refused to extend the restraining order, a small victory for the Trump administration. But Robart\u2019s decision, which was broader than Gorton\u2019s and applied nationally, came less than two hours after Gorton issued his decision on Friday.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department cited Gorton\u2019s ruling in their appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which oversees the US District of Washington, and where arguments in the appeal of Robart\u2019s decision are being heard this afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the US Courts system, the US Judicial Conference, which sets policies for the courts, has increasingly researched allowing cameras in the courtroom but has generally opposed a nationwide decision to broadcast proceedings. The conference has found after recent studies that \u201cthe intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors was cause for concern.\u201d\n\nThe District of Massachusetts participated in a three-year pilot program to broadcast civil proceedings that ended in 2015. But the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which oversees Massachusetts, does not allow any type of recording of hearings.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
