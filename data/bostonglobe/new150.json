They chanted: \u201cNo hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!\u201d They called Trump a racist and a fascist. They insisted he was violating the Constitution and vowed to resist him.\n\nThe demonstration, organized by the Massachusetts branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, began less than 12 hours after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs and Magistrate Judge Judith Dein of Massachusetts imposed a seven-day restraining order against Trump\u2019s executive order, permitting lawful immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Syria to enter the United States. The temporary ruling prohibits federal officials from detaining or deporting immigrants and refugees with valid visas or green cards or forcing them to undergo extra security screenings under Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker, a Republican who did not attend the anti-Trump Boston Women\u2019s March on Jan. 21, was once again a no-show. According to his administration, he was attending a funeral. His absence was noted by the crowd, which at one point chanted, \u201cWhere\u2019s Governor Baker?\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

A spokesman said Saturday that Baker opposes the executive order.\n\n\u201cThe confusion for families is real,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe unexpected disruption for law abiding people is real. And the lack of guidance associated with such an abrupt and overwhelming decision is hugely problematic for all involved. . . . Thankfully, the federal courts will have an opportunity to straighten this out.\u201d\n\nDespite the court ruling, it appears at least three passengers were detained for hours Sunday at Logan International Airport.\n\nAn Iranian woman who has been legally living in the United States arrived on an Emirates flight from Dubai that landed around 7:28 a.m., and was held for nearly three hours, according to her lawyer, Howard Silverman. Around 10:15 a.m., she was allowed to leave the airport with her husband, who is also from Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSilverman, who declined to release his client\u2019s name, said the early morning federal court ruling should have prevented officials from detaining his client. Still, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy she\u2019s been released and she\u2019s back with her family.\u201d\n\nLater Sunday, Maryam Ghodrati received a text, sent from somewhere on the Logan tarmac. \u201cWe landed; let\u2019s see how it goes,\u201d Ghodrati said, reading aloud the message from her Iranian husband, Alireza, as she waited for him in Terminal E around 2 p.m. It didn\u2019t go well; her husband would not emerge for another four hours.\n\nGhodrati, a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said she is a naturalized citizen; her husband, a PhD working in the area, has his green card. Their 10-year-old son was born here, and the family lives in Hopkinton.\n\nShe said her husband had returned to their home country of Iran on Thursday because his father had died. A day later, Trump issued his controversial executive order.\n\nWorried about making it back into the United States, Ghodrati said her husband cut short his trip and missed his father\u2019s memorial. He flew from Iran to Qatar for a connecting flight to Boston, where he was detained. He was ultimately released near 6 p.m. The couple embraced quickly and left without speaking to reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another instance, a PhD student in engineering management at Western New England University who declined to give her name said her friend Sona was detained after arriving at 1:45 p.m. from Dubai. Sona appeared a few hours later, hugged her friend, and spoke to an ACLU lawyer in Farsi.\n\nState Representative Geoff Diehl, a Whitman Republican and former state cochairman of the Trump presidential campaign, said the Copley demonstration and others like it are \u201cthe next phase\u201d of an effort by Trump opponents to obstruct the new president\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThe former president, Obama, said elections have consequences,\u201d Diehl told the Globe. \u201cThe fact is, a certain percentage of people in this country do want to have better security checks.\u201d Trump, he said, is just keeping his promises. \u201cI understand certain people may not agree on the policy, but it was something he made very clear on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nMayor Martin J. Walsh, also a featured speaker at the Boston women\u2019s march the previous weekend, told demonstrators Sunday that \u201cdiscriminating against specific immigrant groups and religions is wrong.\u201d\n\nCity Councilor Tito Jackson, who has announced that he will challenge Walsh in the mayoral race this fall, told the crowd he stands \u201cin unity with my Muslim brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey was among 16 state attorneys general Sunday who blasted Trump\u2019s executive order in a joint statement, pledging to use their offices to fight it. Joining Healey in the statement were attorneys general from New York, California, Pennsylvania, Washington, Hawaii, Virginia, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Connecticut, Vermont, Illinois, New Mexico, Iowa, Maine, and Maryland.\n\nAt the Copley protest, Fabienne Annylusse, 23, of Dorchester, said she worries about her Muslim friends.\n\n\u201cI believe what Trump is doing is deeply inhumane \u2014 immoral,\u201d she said, noting her family had moved to Boston from Haiti. \u201cWe\u2019re a melting pot. It\u2019s just not right to ban anyone from this country because of their religion.\u201d\n\nLaleh Golestani, an Iranian-Canadian biomedical engineer currently working at Harvard University, said she has colleagues who work locally in advanced medicine but as citizens of one of the banned countries can no longer attend conferences or see family members.\n\n\u201cI feel as if they\u2019re going to come after me because I have Iranian blood \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening to many of my friends who are also dual citizens,\u201d Golestani said. She moved to the United States three years ago. Golestani said Trump\u2019s rise has her struggling to recognize the country she first knew.\n\n\u201cWhen me and my husband first moved here, everything seemed so stable,\u201d Golestani said. \u201cBut when the news started breaking . . . I feel like a Jew during the dawn of Hitler.\u201d\n\nBoston police said the protest was peaceful.\n\nAstead Herndon, David Abel, Nicole Dungca, and Maria Sacchetti of the Globe staff and Globe correspondents Jeremy C.
