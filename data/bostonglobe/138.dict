And the thinking inside the White House was that the administration needed a more moderate approach. It didn\u2019t help matters that Bannon was in an open war with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut instead of being dumped, Bannon is back in power, and his influence appears to be growing.\n\nThe biggest sign of Bannon\u2019s changing fortunes: Trump walked away from the Paris agreement on climate change Thursday afternoon. Withdrawing from the deal was reportedly a hotly contested issue inside the White House. Even 24 hours before Trump announced his decision, he told reporters he wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do and was hearing from all sides.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

But Bannon and his handpicked choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, urged Trump to leave. Politico reported that both Bannon and Ivanka angled to make sure those sympathetic to their sides were meeting with Trump before the decision.\n\n\n\nWhen Trump did announce the decision, there was Bannon, beaming in the front row of the Rose Garden, while television pundits pointed out how he had once again emerged a winner. After weeks of losing battles to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, he had notched a high-profile win over Trump\u2019s daughter.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the victory on the Paris issue. There were signs that his power has grown in recent days.\n\n1. Trump\u2019s first foreign trip had Bannon\u2019s fingerprints all over it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president\u2019s major speech on Islam was written by Bannon ally Stephen Miller. When Trump traveled to Europe and scolded other countries and suggested that America was less interested in international cooperation, that was in line with Bannon\u2019s belief that there is a global nationalistic movement underway.\n\n2. Bannon is being tapped to be Trump\u2019s chief defender.\n\nAs the trip as wrapping up, there was word that the White House would set up a \u201cwar room\u201d to battle questions swirling around the Russia investigation and unflattering leaks from \u201cthe deep state.\u201d Leading that war room effort: Bannon.\n\n3. Bannon keeps getting to appoint his people to powerful positions.\n\nAlso this week, there was word that Bannon is close to installing a friend to head up the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which essentially oversees all US government outlets that reach foreign audiences. This position allows Bannon to show his influence around the world. Moderate voices in the White House would have preferred a different voice.\n\nIt has helped, of course, that Bannon\u2019s main rivals have been distracted and brought down a peg lately. Kushner is reportedly under scrutiny by the FBI for a number of meetings he had with the Russians, possibly including a request to create a communication backchannel with the Kremlin. Plus, Trump reportedly isn\u2019t happy that Kushner\u2019s sister was implying to Chinese investors that US visas could essentially be bought. Meanwhile, Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff, has been fighting just to keep his job, as Trump sounds out other people about replacing Priebus.\n\nOne person not looking for another job these days: Bannon.\n\n", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "type": "article"}
