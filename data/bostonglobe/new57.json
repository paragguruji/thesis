The administration appealed to the nation\u2019s highest court after the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month.\n\nNeal Katyal, the lawyer who argued for the challengers in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, wrote on Twitter, \u2018\u2018Its kinda odd to have the defendant in Hawaii v Trump acting as our co-counsel. We don\u2019t need the help but will take it!\u2019\u2019 He also wrote that he was \u2018\u2018waiting now for the inevitable cover-my-tweet posts from him that the Solicitor General will no doubt insist upon.\u2019\u2019\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump\u2019s own comments in ordering the ban be frozen, determining that the president\u2019s words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive.\n\nThe majority opinion in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump\u2019s tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \u2018\u2018total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u2019\u2019\n\nOmar Jadwat, who argued the case in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, wrote that Trump\u2019s tweets amounted to \u2018\u2018a promise: let me do this and I\u2019ll take it as license to do even worse.\u2019\u2019\n\nGovernment lawyers have sought to convince judges they should not consider the president\u2019s statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban themselves. They have also sought to portray the president\u2019s words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question \u2014 though not all \u2014 came before Trump was elected.\n\n\u2018\u2018We shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u2019\u2019 acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s latest tweets will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump\u2019s revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version.\n\nThat version, which unilaterally revoked visas from tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was much more onerous and had a provision in the text itself that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \u2018\u2018should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\u2019\u2019 to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump himself signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court.\n\nTrump also wrote that the Justice Department \u2018\u2018should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\u2019\u2019 The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; they are merely weighing whether Trump\u2019s order can pass constitutional muster.\n\nThe travel ban seems to have been on Trump\u2019s mind since the terrorist attack in London Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \u2018\u2018We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u2019\u2019\n\nLegal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case.\n\n\u2018\u2018In case it\u2019s not obvious, these will only undermine the government\u2019s case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\u2019\u2019 University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \u2018\u2018These will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump also wrote on Twitter that the administration was already \u2018\u2018EXTREME VETTING\u2019\u2019 travelers coming into the United States \u2014 which he said was necessary to keep the country safe because courts are \u2018\u2018slow and political!\u2019\u2019 The Department of Homeland Security has previously suggested such vetting was taking place, but that, too, seems to undercut the Justice Department\u2019s legal position.\n\nThe travel ban was supposed to be a temporary measure, designed to afford the administration time to conduct a review and decide what new vetting procedures were necessary. When a federal judge in Hawaii ordered the ban frozen, though, the government interpreted his order as stopping even that review \u2014 and the judge declined to clarify that it did not.\n\nWall told the Fourth Circuit last month that the administration had \u2018\u2018put our pens down\u2019\u2019 and had \u2018\u2018done nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf the administration already has implemented new vetting procedures, that would seem to call into question the necessity of a temporary ban. Legal analysts, though, have previously said that president\u2019s remarks indicate he might not view the measure as temporary \u2014 despite what the text of the executive order itself says.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "Washington Post"], "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["travel", "hurt", "tweets", "trump", "ban", "vetting", "court", "version", "order", "trumps", "restore", "justice", "latest", "department", "effort"], "summary": "Advertisement\u2018\u2018People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u2019\u2019 Trump wrote.\nAdvertisementTrump\u2019s latest tweets will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump\u2019s revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version.\nThe travel ban seems to have been on Trump\u2019s mind since the terrorist attack in London Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \u2018\u2018We need to be smart, vigilant and tough.\nWe need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u2019\u2019Legal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case.\nThe travel ban was supposed to be a temporary measure, designed to afford the administration time to conduct a review and decide what new vetting procedures were necessary."}
