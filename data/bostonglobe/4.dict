A suspension of non-immigrant visas to citizens for Venezuela, for instance, will apply only to certain government officials and their immediate families.\n\nThe announcement comes the same day as Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire 90 days after it went into effect. That ban had barred citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who lacked a \u2018\u2018credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\u2019\u2019 from entering the U.S. Only one of those countries, Sudan, will no longer be subject to travel restrictions.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted late Sunday after the new policy was announced.\n\nUnlike the first iteration of Trump\u2019s travel ban, which sparked chaos at airports across the country and a flurry of legal challenges after being hastily written with little input outside the White House, officials stressed they had been working for months on the new rules, in collaboration with various agencies and in conversation with foreign governments.\n\nTo limit confusion, valid visas would not be revoked as a result of the proclamation. The order also permits, but does not guarantee, case-by-case waivers for citizens of the affected countries who meet certain criteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat includes: having previously worked or studied in the U.S. for a lengthy and continuous period of time activity; having previously established \u2018\u2018significant contacts\u2019\u2019 in the U.S.; and having \u2018\u2018significant business or professional obligations\u2019\u2019 in the U.S. Still, officials acknowledged the waiver restrictions were narrower than the exemptions for people with bona fide ties to the United States that the Supreme Court mandated before the expiring order went into effect in late June.\n\nThe restrictions are targeted at countries that the Department of Homeland Security says fail to share sufficient information with the U.S. or haven\u2019t taken necessary security precautions.\n\nDHS has spent recent months working to develop a new security baseline, which includes factors such as whether countries issue electronic passports with biometric information, report lost or stolen passports to INTERPOL, and share information about travelers\u2019 terror-related and criminal histories. The U.S. then shared those benchmarks with every country in the world and gave them 50 days to comply.\n\nA total of sixteen countries did not comply with the rules at first, officials said, but half worked with the U.S. to improve their information-sharing and security practices. The remaining eight are now subject to the new restrictions until they make changes to bring them into compliance.\n\nThe new rules include the suspension of all immigrant visas for nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, and the suspension of non-immigrant visas, such as for business and tourism, to nationals of Chad, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Yemen.\n\nCitizens of Iran will not be eligible for tourism and business visas, but remain eligible for student and cultural exchange visas if they undergo additional scrutiny. Such additional scrutiny will also be required for Somali citizens applying for all non-immigrant visas.\n\nTrump last week called for a \u2018\u2018tougher\u2019\u2019 travel ban after a bomb partially exploded on a London subway.\n\n\u2018\u2018The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u2019\u2019 he tweeted.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of overstepping his legal authority and violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protections against religious bias each time he has ordered new travel restrictions.\n\nAnd the inclusion of Venezuela and North Korea appeared to be an attempt to block challenges from advocacy groups and others who have called the restrictions a ban on Muslims. Trump during his campaign called for a \u2018\u2018total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe U.S. had already imposed wide-ranging sanctions on certain high-ranking Venezuelan government officials to protest the government\u2019s attempts to consulate power. The new visa sanctions will apply to all officials from five Venezuelan government security agencies and their immediate families.\n\nJohnathan Smith, legal director of the advocacy group Muslim Advocates, slammed the measures in a statement as the \u2018\u2018same Muslim ban\u2019\u2019 and an attempt \u2018\u2018to undermine our Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Let us not be fooled by the administration\u2019s attempted tricks and semantics, this is still the same Muslim ban,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The administration is once again making cosmetic adjustments to the Muslim ban in hopes that it will pass the barest possible definition of anything else; but they\u2019ve failed again.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut administration officials argue the measure is necessary to keep Americans safe.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement the president was carrying out his duty to protect the American people. He said the State Department would coordinate with other federal agencies to implement the measures in \u2018\u2018an orderly manner\u2019\u2019 and would \u2018\u2018continue to work closely with our allies and partners who share our commitment to national and global security.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new policy could also complicate the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming review of the order, which is scheduled for argument next month.\n\nThe Justice Department has suggested to the Supreme Court that the two sides submit new legal briefs by October 5 \u2014 five days before the argument \u2014 that address how the new policy will affect the case.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-24", "type": "article"}
