Despite her visa, her scheduled trip to Washington, D.C., Monday has been jeopardized by the order President Trump signed late Friday aimed at keeping terrorists out of the country \u2014 no small irony since Dakhil is being honored for her courage in fighting those same terrorists, noted Katrina Lantos Swett, president of the Lantos Foundation.\n\nSwett, a former Democratic congressional candidate from New Hampshire, blasted the president\u2019s broad order for missing its targets, calling Dakhil a \u201cmuch-heralded human rights hero who has done as much as anyone else to rescue enslaved women and girls from ISIS and who exemplifies the brave and courageous partner we need in the fight against ISIS.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

She was due to travel to the United States with her sister. The State Department declined to discuss details of the case, noting that visa records are confidential under US law. However, a State Department official noted that both his department and the Department of Homeland Security may issue visas that would otherwise be blocked under the executive order when in the national interest.\n\nThe official said the departments are working together closely to identify \u201cexceptions to this executive order that are in the national interest\u201d and will provide additional details as they become available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s order halting travel from seven countries for 90 days is aimed at protecting the United States from terrorists who would seek to infiltrate the country. It bars most refugees from resettlement in the United States for 120 days and prohibits refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nThe foundation and its Lantos Human Rights Prize are named for Swett\u2019s father, the late Congressman Tom Lantos, who was the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress and who cofounded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.\n\nThe award ceremony, scheduled at the US Capitol for next Wednesday , will take place even if Dakhil can\u2019t be there. Swett noted it wouldn\u2019t be the first time an award was given to an empty chair, citing Nobel laureates who were not permitted to attend ceremonies. In 2010, Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison for his nonviolent struggle for human rights in China. In 1975, the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, Andrei Sakharov, was barred by the leaders of the Soviet Union from traveling to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for opposing the abuse of power and championing human rights.\n\n\u201cHow ironic it is that we have a hero human rights defender, who has permission from her country to leave, but she may be deprived as these two great figures were \u2014 not because she\u2019s being restrained by a communist dictatorship but because our government won\u2019t let her in,\u201d said Swett.\n\nDakhil received the foundation\u2019s award for defending the Yazidi people, a religious sect in Iraq that faced mass genocide and religious persecution by the Islamic State. More than 5,000 Yazidi were killed and thousands more girls and women sold into slavery, the United Nations concluded last summer. Dakhil drew attention to their plight in August 2014 with an impassioned speech before the Iraqi Parliament that \u201csingle-handedly moved the governments of Iraq and the United States to intervene on behalf of the Yazidi people,\u201d Swett said in a statement announcing the prize. \u201cAs a result of her impassioned plea, thousands of lives were saved.\u201d\n\nAnd even as it recognized the plight of the Yazidi, the Obama administration was criticized for being slow to designate as genocide the persecution of Christians by ISIS. The State Department did so in March 2016 after a unanimous resolution was passed by Congress.\n\nDakhil continues in her efforts to free women and children taken by ISIS as sex slaves, Swett said.\n\n\u201cThey are bought and sold in slave markets, brutalized, and treated in ways that are hard for us to wrap our heads around,\u201d Swett said. \u201cAnd Vian is part of a network that is engaged in ongoing rescue missions. They are trying to ransom these girls, help them escape. They are ceaselessly working to try and free these girls from a true nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe foundation launched the prize in 2009, with the Dalai Lama. Four years later, it was awarded to Hillary Clinton for championing women\u2019s rights. Past recipients also include Elie Wiesel and Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n\nThe prize aims to \u201cshine a light on those heroes of the human rights movement who . . . exemplify what my father fought for, who exemplify the importance of people standing up for the freedom and decency and dignity of every human being around the world,\u201d Swett said. \u201cWe consider these human rights heroes to be . . . the rock stars of humanity.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Swett said, she fielded a call from the British House of Lords with an offer to use the British Parliament as a venue for the award ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story that I think is really resonating with a lot of people,\u201d she said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
