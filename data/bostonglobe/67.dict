The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut until then, the Department of Homeland Security will begin restricting some visitors from six countries \u2014 Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen \u2014 as outlined in a revised executive order issued by President Donald Trump in March.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesman said the agency was working with the Justice Department and the State Department to provide guidance for carrying out the travel restrictions.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

The court said the ban could not be imposed on anyone who had \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nImmigration advocates who had challenged the travel ban in court said that meant the vast majority of people seeking to enter the United States to visit a relative, accept a job, attend a university or deliver a speech would still be able to come.\n\nOmar Jadwat, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s immigrants rights project, said the organization would be watching closely to see the government\u2019s guidance about how it imposes the restrictions. If the United States immediately starts enforcing new rules, Jadwat said, \u201cit means that everybody is going to be in the situation of kind of scrambling to understand whatever they put out and work through the issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump first issued an executive order in January blocking visitors from seven countries, including Iraq, from traveling to the United States for 90 days. He also suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days. Homeland Security Department officials said the time was needed to address gaps in the government\u2019s screening and vetting procedures.\n\nBut after a federal judge blocked the travel restrictions, the administration in March revised the order to exclude Iraq and dropped the suspension of the refugee program. That, too, was blocked by a federal judge.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-28", "type": "article"}
