It\u2019s about time.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

They\u2019ll smile at you. They\u2019ll take everything you bring in, and then when you leave, you get blown up. I\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201d\n\nMost of the dozen veterans interviewed by the Globe said the United States needs better vetting of refugees and citizens from the countries Trump singled out \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, and Somalia.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, suspends the admission of all refugees to the United States for 120 days and bars any citizen from six of the Muslim-majority countries for 90 days pending a review of screening procedures. Refugees from Syria have been barred indefinitely.\n\nSupport among veterans appears to reflect their preferences at the polls, where 60 percent voted for Trump, compared with 34 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to CNN exit polls.\n\nSome veterans, however, are outspoken opponents of Trump\u2019s approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel who teaches at Boston University, the travel ban sends a \u201cwrong-headed\u201d message to an important ally whose soldiers continue to fight alongside Americans in the grinding effort to defeat ISIS extremists.\n\n\u201cI would hope that Iraqis who have helped us would not see President Trump\u2019s action as reflecting the attitude of Americans in general,\u201d said Bacevich, whose son, Andrew Jr., an Army officer, was killed in Iraq in 2007.\n\n\u201cI can understand that they might. It has to be a slap in their face,\u201d Bacevich added. \u201cIt\u2019s more than disloyalty. It\u2019s extreme disgratitude for people who put their lives on the line for the United States.\u201d\n\nBrian Willette, a 51-year-old Army National Guard veteran from South Hadley who was wounded in Afghanistan, said he sympathizes with those Iraqis who aided US forces and wish to move to the United States.\n\n\u201cThey put our lives in their hands helping us,\u201d said Willette, who is commander of the Western Massachusetts chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart. \u201cEverybody knows what the other guy is doing over there.\u201d\n\nA State Department official said Wednesday that no Iraqi holding a Special Immigrant Visa \u2014 issued to interpreters and others who helped the US military or government \u2014 will be denied entrance to the United States.\n\nIn addition, the official said that US embassies and consulates will continue to process and issue those visas to qualified applicants, many of whom are in danger.\n\nStill, Willette believes that stepping back for security\u2019s sake is prudent in other cases.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re always right to be cautious. We\u2019ve been cautious in the past, but I guess this was not rolled out in the best of style,\u201d Willette said of the order, whose implementation led to chaos and confusion at several airports last weekend.\n\nJonathan Janiec, a 33-year-old veteran from Dorchester, also said he supports the 90-day review.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair that we have to resort to these measures, but it will take some time to look at the vetting process. It can\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Janiec, a former Army captain who served one tour in Iraq and two in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI think we should take a long, hard look at who we\u2019re letting in and how many we\u2019re letting in. We ultimately have a right to control our own destiny,\u201d Janiec said.\n\nJosh Foster, a former Army comrade of Janiec\u2019s, works for a contractor that provides biometric services for the US government in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. To Foster, the delay is a mere \u201chiccup.\u201d\n\nAlthough biometrics \u2014 measuring unique physical traits such as facial and retinal features \u2014 are critically important in confirming someone\u2019s identity, the data cannot verify whether biographical information such as birth date, hometown, and even a name are accurate.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know who they are in Iraq unless we had encountered them previously,\u201d said Foster, who is based in Fredericksburg, Va.\n\nJorge Castro, a 62-year-old Army veteran from Dorchester who served in Iraq in 2003, said patience is prudent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to let the system play itself out,\u201d Castro said. \u201cA lot of the country actually didn\u2019t want us there. I\u2019m think I\u2019m lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\nBrian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com", "authors": ["Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["veterans", "sense", "travel", "veteran", "trump", "ban", "makes", "iraq", "think", "united", "states", "trumps", "army", "order", "willette"], "summary": "They fought beside Iraqi soldiers, handed candy to Iraqi children, and depended on Iraqis to tell friend from foe.\nTo these veterans, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies seem to be a common-sense approach to unpredictable danger \u2014 even though refugees can take years to be vetted and visitors often wait weeks and more for visas.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201dMost of the dozen veterans interviewed by the Globe said the United States needs better vetting of refugees and citizens from the countries Trump singled out \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, and Somalia.\nSupport among veterans appears to reflect their preferences at the polls, where 60 percent voted for Trump, compared with 34 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to CNN exit polls.\nIt can\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Janiec, a former Army captain who served one tour in Iraq and two in Afghanistan."}
