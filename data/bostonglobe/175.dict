Protests ensued around the country, including at Logan, as passengers were detained or turned away.\n\nThis federal ruling applies to individuals from the seven countries in Trump\u2019s policy who \u201cabsent of the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

They arrived at Logan around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and were held \u201csolely pursuant to an executive order issued\u201d by Trump, the petition said.\n\nAttorney Susan Church, who leads the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the professors were released three hours later.\n\nThe immigration lawyers and the ACLU of Massachusetts filed the lawsuit on the professors\u2019 behalf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision also ordered secondary screenings be limited to comply with the regulations in the executive order and that US Customs and Border Protection should notify airlines with incoming flights to Logan to ensure the court order is followed.\n\nAlso Saturday night, a federal judge in New York ruled that refugees and non-US citizens who have been detained at airports across the country should not be deported.\n\nAround 10 p.m., about 10 immigration lawyers gathered at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in a late-night attempt to ensure Massachusetts would be included in any national legal action.\n\nFor hours, the group of lawyers, mostly women, debated legal arguments and scan documents on their cellphones. At least one attorney arrived in formal dress after rushing to the courthouse directly from another event.\n\nLawyer Sue Finegan left gala to come to the court. Susan Cohen ditched a 60th birthday party. And Laura Rotolo of the ACLU left after her 6-year-old\u2019s birthday party.\n\n\u201cWe all raced over to help,\u201d Finegan said.\n\nLawyer Kerry Doyle carried a copy of the Immigrant and Nationality Act under her arm, and lawyer Melissa Smith handed out Girl Scout cookies \u2014 Thin Mints \u2014 for sustenance.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "type": "article"}
