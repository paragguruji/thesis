That announcement followed a day of confusion nationally over how to carry out Trump\u2019s order, and to whom it applies.\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers warned that incoming travelers from the seven countries could be subject to long interrogations or be turned away upon arrival at a US airport. The warning was delivered even in Boston, despite a federal judge\u2019s predawn ruling that aimed to keep Trump\u2019s directive from being honored at Logan International Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus said mid-morning on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that 325,000 foreign travelers came into the United States on Saturday, and 109 were detained for further questioning because they came from one of the seven countries.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

He said many Muslim-majority nations were not banned and said the seven nations had been identified by the Obama administration as \u201csources of terror.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\nLawyers said Sunday that they hoped immigration officials would obey federal court rulings in New York, Boston, and elsewhere that temporarily halted Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nSome advocates urged travelers from the affected countries to fly directly to Boston, where two federal judges on Sunday imposed a wide-ranging, albeit temporary, block on Trump\u2019s order that went further than rulings elsewhere.\n\nThe judges in Boston barred federal agents from detaining, deporting, or extensively interrogating travelers based on Trump\u2019s order and instructed them to inform airlines overseas of the order.\n\n\u201cOur order is the most expansive order in the country,\u201d said Susan Church, one of the lawyers who brought the Boston case. \u201cThat seems to be the best protection that somebody could have at this point in time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers said they would not recommend that all travelers fly through Boston and instead suggested that they avoid airports that aren\u2019t following the court rulings.\n\n\u201cI just think that Boston may not be a panacea,\u201d Howard Silverman, a veteran immigration lawyer in Boston, said by phone Sunday from Logan Airport, where he was monitoring arrivals. \u201cEveryone fly into Boston? I don\u2019t think anybody here would want that.\u201d\n\nThe New York ruling, issued Saturday, temporarily barred federal agents from deporting immigrants from those nations because of Trump\u2019s order, though the ruling said officials could still detain them. Lawyers said the New York ruling, and parts of the Boston ruling, applied nationwide.\n\nConfusion abounded on Sunday.\n\nA woman in Watertown wondered what advice to give to a Syrian friend in Lebanon who wanted to book a flight to return to his wife in Massachusetts and his job at CVS.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said the woman, who is also Syrian but asked not to be identified, for fear of retaliation from the US government. \u201cHe said, \u2018I need to be back.\u2019 His wife is here. . . . It\u2019s a risk. Either he\u2019s going to be admitted, or not.\u201d\n\nAdding to the confusion, Trump and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees customs and immigration agents, issued contradictory statements in response to the court rulings.\n\nEarly Sunday, Homeland Security said the government would obey judicial orders, but insisted that Trump\u2019s executive order remained in place.\n\n\u201cNo foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAlso Sunday, Priebus went on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to say the travel ban did not apply to green card holders from the affected nations, contradicting an earlier Homeland Security statement that it did.\n\nThe confusion frightened immigrants and infuriated lawyers and lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe statement from the Department of Homeland Security raises more questions than it answers,\u201d Senator Edward Markey said in a statement calling on Trump to rescind the order.\n\nLawyers said travelers from the seven countries should carry copies of the federal court rulings to the airports to show to airport personnel and later to immigration and customs officials, if needed.\n\nAnd they have been urging travelers to designate someone inside the United States to monitor their arrival.\n\nIf immigrants are delayed for questioning at airports \u2014 as some were in Boston on Sunday, despite the court ruling \u2014 their loved ones should call an attorney who could file a lawsuit on their behalf, lawyers said.\n\nSunday evening, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement, saying green card holders would be allowed in under Trump\u2019s order, unless they \u201cpose a serious threat to public safety and welfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn applying the provisions of the president\u2019s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn his late Sunday defense of his executive order, Trump pointed out it was only a temporary halt on travelers from specific nations affected by terrorism so that the United States could ensure that all travelers had been properly vetted.\n\n\u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants, and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d he said.\n\nBut lawyers say customs agents wield broad powers to deport someone \u2014 sometimes to dangerous countries \u2014 without a hearing before a judge. Some travelers aren\u2019t even allowed to make telephone calls before they are forced back onto an airplane.\n\n\u201cThey do have very significant authority,\u201d said Boston immigration lawyer Kerry Doyle. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about businesses and families and things being disrupted, but you\u2019re also talking about people whose lives are on the line.\u201d\n\nMilton J.
