The asylum seekers, who are fleeing President Trump\u2019s travel and refugee bans as well as stepped-up arrests of undocumented immigrants, have received warm welcomes. But opposition politicians are criticizing the government of Justin Trudeau for being too harsh or too lax in its approach.\n\nIn a recent survey from the Angus Reid Institute, a Vancouver-based opinion research firm, most Canadians were supportive of the government\u2019s decision to maintain its target of accepting 40,000 refugees in 2017. But 25 percent wanted to see Ottawa enact a travel ban similar to the Trump order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn answer to a separate question, 40 percent said they think Canada is accepting too many refugees. The number of refugee claims has spiked since Trump\u2019s election. On the Quebec border with the United States alone, there were 452 claims in January, compared with 137 in the same month a year ago.\n\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning.

What are we going to see when the snow melts?\u2019\u2019 said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute.\n\nJenny Kwan, a member of Parliament for the left-leaning New Democratic Party, wants Ottawa to withdraw from its Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States. That pact states that an individual arriving at an official Canadian border point from the United States isn\u2019t allowed to make a refugee claim, an effort to avoid \u2018\u2018asylum shopping.\u2019\u2019 But if an asylum seeker crosses into Canada irregularly \u2014 as the current wave of migrants is \u2014 and then calls the police, he or she can make a claim legally.\n\n\u2018\u2018We need to stand up for human rights,\u2019\u2019 she told The Washington Post. \u2018\u2018We are seeing people who are crossing to Canada through the back door. They are literally risking life and limb. I don\u2019t think the US can be considered a safe country for refugees at this moment.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the Conservative Party says the Trudeau government isn\u2019t doing enough to protect \u2018\u2018the integrity of our border,\u2019\u2019 said Michelle Rempel, Conservative member of Parliament. She wants the government to make it clear that crossing the border outside official crossings is \u2018\u2018illegal and unsafe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018I have this feeling that we\u2019re going to see big numbers coming across once the weather gets better,\u2019\u2019 said Greg Janzen, the reeve \u2014 the equivalent of a mayor \u2014 of Emerson, Manitoba, a town on the border with North Dakota that has seen growing numbers of asylum seekers.\n\nThe arrivals were once simply a weekend phenomenon, but refugees are now turning up on a daily basis. \u2018\u2018We had six this morning,\u2019\u2019 Janzen said Wednesday. \u2018\u2018I think they walked up to the hotel. They kept them in the lobby until the [The Royal Canadian Mounted Police] came.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police bring the refugees to the local border post, where they are processed and then driven to Winnipeg, the nearest large city. There have been no incidents involving the refugees aside from two Ghanaians who suffered serious frostbite before Christmas, but Janzen remains worried. He\u2019d like to see a change in the law that would allow claims to be made at the border point \u2014 even if numbers increase as a result.\n\n\u2018\u2018That way they\u2019re not coming through town,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s safer for them and it\u2019s safer for townspeople.\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Alan Freeman", "Washington Post"], "publish_date": "2017-02-23", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["numbers", "spring", "trickle", "united", "asylum", "states", "think", "border", "migrants", "refugees", "canadian", "deluge", "fleeing", "canada"], "summary": "Stories of migrants hauling children and suitcases across frozen fields and snow-covered ditches into Canada have become headline news.\nThe asylum seekers, who are fleeing President Trump\u2019s travel and refugee bans as well as stepped-up arrests of undocumented immigrants, have received warm welcomes.\nAdvertisementIn answer to a separate question, 40 percent said they think Canada is accepting too many refugees.\nOn the Quebec border with the United States alone, there were 452 claims in January, compared with 137 in the same month a year ago.\nJenny Kwan, a member of Parliament for the left-leaning New Democratic Party, wants Ottawa to withdraw from its Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States."}
