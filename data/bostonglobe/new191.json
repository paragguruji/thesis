After Saturday\u2019s attacks in the London Bridge area that claimed seven lives, for example, Trump panned the mayor for telling the public there was \u2018\u2018no reason to be alarmed\u2019\u2019 by the atrocity.\n\nIn fact, Khan was referring in his televised remarks to the presence of armed officers on the capital\u2019s streets. When the British press ridiculed Trump\u2019s out-of-context quote, the president returned to Twitter to accuse the media of buying the mayor\u2019s \u2018\u2018pathetic excuse.\u2019\u2019\n\nPathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporters repeatedly asked Khan for his thoughts on Trump outside the headquarters of London\u2019s Ambulance Service, where he observed a minute of silence Tuesday to honor of the victims of the attacks.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

He calmly explained his opposition to Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban on visitors from several Muslim countries. But he dropped a hint of annoyance when asked about Trump\u2019s social media jibes.\n\n\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but I really don\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s extraordinary attacks on the popular mayor of a grieving city have disgusted many Londoners, reigniting opposition to a state visit by the American president to the United Kingdom planned for later this year. Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump a week after his Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nKhan is among those who have asked the government to reconsider the invitation, describing the state visit as \u2018\u2018inappropriate\u2019\u2019 given the president\u2019s months-long push for a travel ban for passengers from several Muslim majority nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments also discomfited many in the United States. They drew an implicit rebuke by the acting U.S. ambassador to the U.K., who praised Khan\u2019s \u2018\u2018strong leadership\u2019\u2019 on Twitter.\n\nAlthough the spat is embarrassing, Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 which according to traditional practice would include staying at Buckingham Palace as a guest of the queen \u2014 does not appear to be in any jeopardy.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Boris Johnson \u2014 Khan\u2019s predecessor as mayor of London \u2014 told BBC radio Tuesday that \u2018\u2018the invitation has been issued and accepted and I see no reason to change that.\u2019\u2019\n\nAddressing Trump\u2019s proposed plan to bar millions of people from Muslim majority countries from entering the United States, which the president said had been vindicated by the attacks, Khan said he found the idea antithetical to American values.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are literally millions and millions of Muslims around the world who love America. They love Britain, they want to come here to study, to be a tourist, to start up a business, to work, to learn. Why would you want to stop them coming?\u2019\u2019 Khan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018We saw on Saturday night some of the people in the health service, some of the consultants, surgeons, were Muslims surgeons, some of them people who\u2019d come to this country from Muslim majority countries,\u2019\u2019 the mayor continued. \u2018\u2018They helped save lives, they reduced the death toll, some of the police officers, some of the armed response teams, who help keep our cities safe, are Muslims.\n\n\u2018\u2018What have you got against them?\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Raphael Satter", "Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["reconsider", "trump", "asks", "visit", "londons", "united", "invitation", "uk", "trumps", "london", "president", "mayor", "khan", "states", "muslim", "britain"], "summary": "In fact, Khan was referring in his televised remarks to the presence of armed officers on the capital\u2019s streets.\nSign up for more newsletters hereThe 46-year-old mayor, who assumed office in May 2016 after serving in Parliament, generally praised the \u2018\u2018special relationship\u2019\u2019 between the United States and Britain.\nHe calmly explained his opposition to Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban on visitors from several Muslim countries.\nAdvertisementTrump\u2019s comments also discomfited many in the United States.\nThey drew an implicit rebuke by the acting U.S. ambassador to the U.K., who praised Khan\u2019s \u2018\u2018strong leadership\u2019\u2019 on Twitter."}
