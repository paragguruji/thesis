The activists planned civil disobedience and disruption of traffic outside presidential candidates\u2019 headquarters, in an effort to make AIDS a campaign issue.\n\nFrom the bodega owners of New York to more than a million angry petitioners in the United Kingdom, people are quickly learning how to act up and fight back against President Trump.\n\nAmid all the rancor, confusion, and potential constitutional crises Trump has ushered in, protesters have formed a nimble, tenacious political movement that crashes gender, racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, and class lines and shows an intensity unseen in more than a generation. It reminds me of when the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, was at its raucous peak, interrupting Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, infiltrating the New York Stock Exchange, and blocking traffic on major thoroughfares with massive \u201cdie-ins.\u201d Protesters would lay down on the ground, representing those who had died \u2014 or might still die \u2014 not just from AIDS, but because of willful inaction by Ronald Reagan\u2019s government.\n\nThis moment demands ACT UP\u2019s sense of outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid France, a filmmaker and author of \u201cHow to Survive a Plague: The Inside Story of How Citizens and Science Tamed AIDS,\u201d attended ACT UP meetings before the New York-born group even had a name, and he watched it expand into 148 chapters in 19 countries. While participating in several anti-Trump rallies, he noted similarities between these two eras of protest.\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

You were among people who understood the way you understood,\u201d France told me Wednesday. \u201cThe development of community \u2014 that\u2019s the first step to building a movement. The idea that you\u2019re not alone and that people share not only your fears, but your ideas about solutions, and about process going forward \u2014 that brings you all together in an attempt to get there.\u201d\n\nHundreds of New York bodegas owned and worked at by Yemenis were closed for much of Thursday to protest Trump\u2019s executive order banning US entry to immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. Scientists are planning a March for Science in Washington in April. LGBTQ activists were scheduled to host a dance party protest Friday weaving a path from Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel to the White House. In Britain, more than 1 million people have asked Parliament to cancel Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 and are planning demonstrations if and when he gets there.\n\nLast week, Trump was even forced to scuttle a visit to a Harley-Davidson factory in Wisconsin, a state that helped him win the election, after company officials expressed concerns about demonstrations. They reportedly suggested that Trump stay home, and he agreed. Barely two weeks ago, many wondered if the momentum generated by worldwide marches against the Trump administration could coalesce into a movement; now it\u2019s changing travel plans at the White House.\n\nIn hip-hop parlance, protesters got Trump shook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if many of today\u2019s protesters are too young to remember ACT UP, they may have cut their teeth on Occupy Wall Street and, especially, the Black Lives Matter movement. Veterans of both groups can be found among the anti-Trump protesters. Some complain that not having a central goal, such as challenging official indifference toward a pandemic, will unravel the current activism. But they have it twisted \u2014 opposing Trump and his destructive policies is the focus. That it has drawn in so many disparate groups together speaks to the urgency of the dissent. And urgency is the oxygen of a movement.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, because I lost so many people in that epidemic, but we might be at a bigger and more dangerous crossroads now,\u201d said France, who also directed the Academy Award-nominated 2012 documentary \u201cHow to Survive a Plague.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is our culture, the very essence of our being as a country and as a people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is democracy anymore? We\u2019re asking all these really fundamental questions now. Back then, the question was, \u2018Can we survive this?\u2019 And I guess that\u2019s the same bottom line now: \u2018Can we survive this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWe\u2019re still less than a month into this presidency, and time will gauge whether an anti-Trump movement can be sustained. Without question, protesters must prove as indefatigable as Trump\u2019s pummeling of civil rights and liberties, and his assaults on the environment, health care, and any semblance of political decorum.\n\nWhat will give stamina to those in the streets now, and in the weeks and months to come, is the sobering knowledge that \u2014 like those early AIDS activists \u2014 they\u2019re not just fighting against a president, but are fighting for their lives.\n\nRenee Graham can be reached at renee.graham@globe.com .
