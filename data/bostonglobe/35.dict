There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe reiterated that the country would resume issuing visas to all countries \u2018\u2018once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.\u2019\u2019\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

Even as the president and other top advisers defended the ban, one top Trump official appeared on Sunday to walk back one of the most controversial elements of the action: its impact on green-card holders, who are permament legal residents of the United States.\n\n\u2018\u2018As far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u2019\u2019 Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC News\u2019s \u2018\u2018Meet the Press,\u2019\u2019 contradicting what government officials had said only a day earlier.\n\nOther senior administration officials on Sunday defended Trump\u2019s ban after a weekend of intense backlash over the broadness of the executive order, even as they sought to clarify its reach. Lawmakers from both parties, including Republican senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), spoke out against the action, and federal judges quickly ruled against parts of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a joint statement, McCain and Graham said the government has a responsibility to defend its borders but must uphold \u2018\u2018all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u2019\u2019 they said, adding, \u2018\u2018Such a hasty process risks harmful results.\u2019\u2019\n\nJudicial rulings in several cities across the country overnight immediately blocked enforcement of the ban to various degrees, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement early Sunday indicating it would continue to implement President Trump\u2019s action.\n\nThe statement, which did little to clear up the confusion and frustration playing out at airports across the globe, said the administration \u2018\u2018will comply with judicial orders\u2019\u2019 even as it continues to carry out the president\u2019s order.\n\n\u2018\u2018Prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u2019\u2019 the statement said. \u2018\u2018No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants, refugees and U.S. legal residents - green-card holders - from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen. People subject to being denied entry include dual nationals, who are those born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile lawyers are still reviewing a federal court\u2019s temporary stay, administration officials said they believe it is possible for the White House to both comply with the judge\u2019s order and continue enforcing Trump\u2019s executive action. Their thinking is that the judge\u2019s order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the judge\u2019s order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place.\n\nThe officials pointed out that while the order affects specifically deportations, the travelers currently stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States.\n\nThat interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo.\n\nJust after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u2018\u2018Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!\u2019\u2019\n\nLater in the morning, Trump tweeted, \u2018\u2018Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president\u2019s aggressive action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, but also from a growing number of lawmakers in his own party.\n\n\u2018\u2018You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have,\u2019\u2019 Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u2018\u2018State of the Union,\u2019\u2019 even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright.\n\nLeaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday also expressed opposition to the controversial ban, it is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society.\n\n\u2018\u2018We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u2019\u2019 said Brian Hooks, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u2019\u2019 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u2018\u2018This Week.\u2019\u2019 He cautioned that the United States doesn\u2019t have a religious test for entry into the country, and stopped short of saying that Trump\u2019s action amounted to a Muslim ban.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think we need to be careful,\u2019\u2019 McConnell said. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security noted that \u2018\u2018less than one percent\u2019\u2019 of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u2018\u2018inconvenienced\u2019\u2019 by the executive order - though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country Saturday was one of widespread uncertainty and even chaos at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained.\n\nFederal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of President Trump\u2019s action flooded courtrooms from coast to coast.\n\nLate Saturday, a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in Virginia, Seattle and Boston.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision.\n\nNext came a temporary restraining order by District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, who blocked for seven days the removal of any green-card holders detained at Dulles International Airport. Brinkema\u2019s action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban.\n\nIn Seattle, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas S. Zilly granted an emergency stay preventing the deportation of two people had been detained at the Sea-Tac International Airport, according to the ACLU of Washington, which joined other advocates in filing an emergency motion. The two people remain in federal custody and will have a hearing later this week, the group said.\n\nJust before 2 a.m. Sunday in Boston, two federal judges ruled for two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth associate professors - Iranian nationals who are permanent legal residents in the United States - who were held at Logan International Airport when they landed after travel for an academic conference.\n\nThe judges there also put a seven-day restraining order on Trump\u2019s executive action. It allows any approved refugee, visa holder, or green-card holder to fly into Boston over the next 7 days and requires Customs and Border Protection to notify airlines that fly into Logan Airport that those passengers will not be detained or forced to return. The ruling applies only to Massachusetts.\n\nThe president\u2019s order also riggered harsh reactions from key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Lawyers and advocates for immigrants are advising them to seek asylum in Canada.\n\nYet Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and impose what became known as his \u2018\u2018Muslim ban,\u2019\u2019 was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters Saturday in the Oval Office. \u2018\u2018You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn New York, Donnelly seemed to have little patience for the government\u2019s arguments, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the lawsuit had already been released.\n\nDonnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \u2018\u2018Our own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\u2019\u2019 she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days earlier, those detained would have been granted admission without question.\n\nDuring the hearing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he had received word of a deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU\u2019s request.\n\nA senior Department of Homeland Security official said late Saturday that 109 people had been denied entry into the United States. All had been in transit when Trump signed the order, he said, and some had already departed the United States on flights by late Saturday while others were still being detained awaiting flights. Also, 173 people had not been allowed to board U.S.-bound planes at foreign airports.\n\nThe protests that had begun at airports around the country on Saturday continued on Sunday, with crowds swelling in terminals from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles and places in between. In Washington, protestors flocked to Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport. By early afternoon, a raucous crowd of demonstrators filled Lafayette Square and part of Pennsylvania Avenue. Fencing that remained from the recent inauguration kept them from getting closer to the gates of the White House.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
