The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1892 banned virtually all immigration from China. The Immigration Act of 1924 targeted immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, particularly Jews, Italians, and Slavs, and culminated in barring Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust from entering America. The belief that Japanese-Americans could never be loyal citizens bred internment camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInto the 1960s, many Americans believed that Catholics placed the Pope above patriotism. The early-to-mid-20th century featured efforts to repatriate Mexican immigrants. Not until 1965 did Congress abolish quotas based on race and national origin.\n\nThis seemed to augur more enlightened times. Strikingly, George W. Bush responded to 9/11 by embracing American Muslims, while distinguishing Al Qaeda from Islam at large.\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

His proposed Muslim ban breaks new ground \u2014 never before has America barred immigrants because of their religion and, by so doing, endangered itself.\n\nVersion 2.0 denies entry to citizens of six Muslim countries, suspends our refugee program worldwide, and cuts our annual quota for refugees from 110,000 to 50,000. In particular, it indefinitely bars refugees from Syria\u2019s chemical slaughterhouse, echoing our rejection of Jews fleeing Hitler \u2014 and casting the pitiless light of reality on Trump\u2019s showy situational empathy for Syrian children murdered with sarin gas.\n\nThis directive raises important constitutional questions concerning religious discrimination. Trump\u2019s first effort to bar travel from specified Muslim-majority countries was found by two federal appellate courts to impose an unconstitutional religious test. So too, thus far, Trump\u2019s second order. In one ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that the second version \u201cin context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs supporting evidence, the court cited \u201ccandidate Trump\u2019s numerous campaign statements expressing animus toward the Islamic faith.\u201d Pertinent here is Trump\u2019s admission that the second version was rewritten to recast an apparent ban on Muslims as, in the words of his lawyers, \u201ca temporary pause\u201d whose \u201ctext and operation are religion-neutral.\u201d\n\nIn the service of this claim, Trump\u2019s counsel now argue to the US Supreme Court that the revised order must be read on its face rather than interpreted in the lethal light of Trump\u2019s campaign calls for an outright ban on Muslim immigration. As a matter of law, this is a decent argument. But, as often, Trump undercut himself by tweeting, saying of his latest order that \u201cthe lawyers and courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Trump added that the \u201cJustice Department should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to [the Supreme Court].\u201d Thus, as president, Trump gave his xenophobic campaign rhetoric targeting Muslims fresh relevance \u2014 for all the world to see.\n\nSoon enough, the Supreme Court will likely resolve the order\u2019s legality. But that is the least of it. For the implications of Trump\u2019s order far transcend the law.\n\nAs counterterrorism, this policy is dumb, dangerous and immoral. It targets \u201cdirected attacks\u201d by terrorists dispatched from abroad by groups like ISIS. But there have been no such attacks since 9/11 \u2014 by Syrian refugees or anyone else. Indeed, why would ISIS try to thread the needle of our extended vetting process, particularly stringent for Syrians?\n\nThe only acts of domestic terrorism have involved radicalized Muslims living in America: \u201cenabled attacks\u201d specifically encouraged by ISIS, or \u201cinspired attacks\u201d by lone-wolf emulators. As the latest attacks in Britain and France reaffirm, this is a threat no responsible president can ignore. Instead, Trump ignores that a critical preventive is the vigilance of America\u2019s overwhelmingly loyal Muslim populace. Trump\u2019s cynical scapegoating escalates risk by prospectively alienating \u2014 in the worst case, radicalizing \u2014 those we most need, while empowering ISIS\u2019s global narrative of jihad against the West.\n\nEqually damaged is our spirit. It is paramount, surely, for Americans \u2014 including American Muslims \u2014 to vigorously advocate tolerance and oppose religious absolutism. It is important to identify and reject an extremist interpretation of Islam which contravenes humane values and helps fuel groups like ISIS. And it is imperative that all Americans be alert to specific threats of terrorist violence.\n\nBut it is also imperative for our president to help Americans distinguish terrorism and religion \u2014 specifically, by utterly rejecting the false narrative that Islam and jihadism are coextensive, an assertion which, in the process, slanders Muslim Americans. By targeting Muslims and shunning Syrians, Trump tramples our tradition of pluralism, and of serving as a refuge for the endangered and oppressed. Already we are experiencing a decline in applications to American colleges by foreign students, who heretofore have seen us as a beacon of openness and who, quite often, have stayed to enrich us with their talents.\n\nWorse, Trump tarnishes us not by inadvertence, but by design.\n\nAt the instance of Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s White House is a magnet for the most disreputable advocates for stigmatizing \u2014 indeed dehumanizing \u2014 all Muslims as threats to our way of life, inviting Americans to fear and despise fellow Americans. For them, Islam is inevitably a terrorist ideology masquerading as a religion, the very practice of which renders Muslims unfit to be citizens.\n\nChief is the rabid conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney. As Peter Beinart reported in the Atlantic, Gaffney asserts that the Muslim Brotherhood secretly controls most American mosques and Muslim organizations, scheming to replace the US Constitution with a caliphate based on sharia law. Unexplained is how 1 percent of America\u2019s populace \u2014 even if unified in a fanciful and fanatic cause all but a handful of them would deplore \u2014 could perpetrate a coup.\n\nAnd yet Bannon calls this erstwhile intellectual pariah \u201cone of the senior thought leaders and men of action in this whole war against Islamic radical jihad.\u201d Another hysteric welcome at the White House is Brigitte Gabriel, whose organization spearheaded last weekend\u2019s anti-Muslim marches decrying the supposed threat of sharia law. Gabriel stridently insists that any \u201cpracticing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America\u201d \u2014 and thus, ironically, that Muslims do not deserve the protections granted all Americans by the Constitution.\n\nThe influence of these Islamophobic fantatics is pervasive. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and CIA Director Mike Pompeo have close ties to Gaffney, whose ideas permeated Trump\u2019s campaign. Former national security advisor Michael Flynn called Gabriel \u201ca national treasure.\u201d Flynn and Bannon aside, key White House aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka personify Islamophobia.\n\nTheir goal? This, it seems: to limit further Muslim immigration, and to treat American Muslims as a potential fifth column who, like Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor, are unworthy of the rights that Americans enjoy. And, beyond, to popularize a nativist vision of an America rooted in a white Judeo-Christian identity \u2014 a place defined not by tolerance and shared ideals, but by tribal loyalties, in which \u201cthe other\u201d has no place. Already we discern its face \u2014 in schoolyard bullying, desecrated mosques, anti-immigrant slurs, anti-Muslim rallies, and random but deadly shootings and stabbings \u2014 most recently in Portland, Ore. \u2014 of those who are, or might be, foreign.\n\nThe face of Donald Trump\u2019s America.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "type": "article"}
