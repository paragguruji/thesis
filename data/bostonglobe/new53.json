The court could then schedule a hearing, or rule whether the immigration order should remain on hold.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts said that although the Seattle judge\u2019s ruling offers additional protection to immigrants, people affected by the order should \u201cmonitor the rapidly evolving situation closely, and consider making needed trips or returns to the United States as early as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 27 executive order prevented entry by visa holders from seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 for 90 days. It also halted refugees from entering the country for 120 days, and closed the door to the Syrian refugees indefinitely. Administration officials have since stated that the order does not apply to green-card holders.\n\nAttorneys and the ACLU of Massachusetts on Sunday said they believe the seven-day restraining order issued early on the morning of Jan. 29 by a federal judge in Massachusetts would remain in place until 11:59 p.m. Monday. The federal rules of civil procedure require that \u201cif the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\u201d\n\nHowever, Church said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten a confirmation from the government that they interpret it that way.\u201d\n\nOn Friday afternoon, another federal judge in Massachusetts ruled against extending the order, saying Trump would likely succeed in the case on the grounds that he has broad authority over federal immigration laws. That ruling was made shortly before US District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued his nationwide halt.\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday, Trump criticized Robart as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and the ruling as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?\u201d he tweeted later.\n\nSupporters of Trump\u2019s executive order expressed hope that the courts would ultimately uphold it, citing national security concerns.\n\nRichard D\u2019Agostino, an attorney who practices in Massachusetts and campaigned for Trump, said he empathizes with the people affected by the ban who have good intentions but believes \u201cwe\u2019ve lost sight of why any country even has an immigration policy.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018Give me your tired, your poor\u2019 is not part of the US Constitution, it\u2019s part of a lovely poem,\u201d said D\u2019Agostino. \u201cWe would implode. We can\u2019t help everyone in the world, as much as we\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU of Massachusetts has continued to offer free legal assistance at Logan for international passengers who may be affected by the order.\n\n\u201cIt makes you appreciate our system of government and shows how great America really can be,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cWe have checks and balances ... The executive branch doesn\u2019t have unchecked authority.\u201d\n\nA combination of stress and hope was palpable Sunday at Logan\u2019s international terminal, where volunteer lawyers gathered \u2014 as they have for days \u2014 by the arrival doors, offering help to waiting families and travelers.\n\nMany people waiting in the terminal brought signs, one with the hashtag \u201c#LetThemFly!\u201d printed in black type, and another with the words \u201cNO BAN\u201d written with a purple marker. Others held signs bearing the names of loved ones expected to join them in Boston.\n\nArsalan Hashemiaghdam, a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, had come to Boston from Iran in October and had waited for his friend, Sahand Faraji, to join him Sunday. Faraji, who had been living in Istanbul for several years, plans to study for a PhD in engineering from South Carolina University. He arrived on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt at about 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt was really frustrating and disappointing,\u201d Faraji said. \u201cI had to cancel my ticket two times.\u201d\n\nHashemiaghdam said he and Faraji each went through several months of \u201cextreme\u201d vetting before they could get visas. It was frustrating to know they could still be kept from coming to the United States even after they received their visas, Hashemiaghdam said.\n\nFaraji, 27, had moved to Istanbul to work on his master\u2019s degree. He and many of his friends had hoped to come to the United States to continue their education and careers.\n\n\u201cWe are not the bad people that President Trump says every day on his Twitter,\u201d Faraji said.\n\nNaser Sharifi, who lives near the Worcester Polytechnic Institute where he studies, was waiting with several friends at the terminal for his wife, Hoda Jalali, and two family friends, who were on the Lufthansa afternoon flight. They all arrived without any trouble on Sunday, they said.\n\nHe said his wife had attempted to fly to Chicago last Saturday, hours after Trump\u2019s policy was enacted, and she was sent back to Iran.\n\n\u201cShe was just crying and crying,\u201d he said. \u201cHeartbroken.\u201d\n\nHis wife had booked another flight from Istanbul to Boston this weekend, knowing she could be turned away again.\n\n\u201cIf you are deported twice, it\u2019s going to have a bad effect on you,\u201d Sharifi said. \u201cShe was brave enough to take the risk.\u201d\n\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .
