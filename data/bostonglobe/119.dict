Twitter users are encouraging riders to #DeleteUber.\n\nKalanick defended his participation on Trump\u2019s panel in his Saturday Facebook post, saying he joined out of the \u2018\u2018belief that by speaking up and engaging we can make a difference.\u2019\u2019\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

The move was perceived of by some on social media as an effort to profit off the protests, because more passengers would need to seek alternatives to cabs. But the company said on Twitter that it had not \u2018\u2018meant to break the strike.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s business advisory group was announced in December as a \u2018\u2018strategic and policy forum\u2019\u2019 that would share its views on \u2018\u2018how government policy impacts economic growth, job creation, and productivity.\u2019\u2019 Chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the investment firm Blackstone, its listed members also include the heads of Disney, Walmart, IBM, and Tesla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalanick has said the company will find a way to compensate and provide legal support to Uber drivers who are stuck overseas for the next three months because they cannot return to the United States. The company also has said it would create a $3 million legal defense fund to help drivers with immigration and translation services.\n\nTrump aides, appearing to reverse course, said on Sunday that citizens of the banned countries who hold permanent US residency \u2018\u2018green cards\u2019\u2019 would not be barred from reentering the country.\n\nRival ride-sharing company Lyft responded by saying it will donate $1 million over the next four years to the American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully requested an emergency order approved by a federal judge Saturday that temporarily bars the United States from deporting people from the countries subject to Trump\u2019s travel ban.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
