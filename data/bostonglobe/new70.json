But critics who wondered aloud why the executive order had been rushed into law were met with a defiant response from Trump himself: \u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d\n\nYet, after the courts blocked that first effort, team Trump took its time with a replacement, ultimately producing a clearer and more carefully-vetted executive order \u2014 while sacrificing little in the way of impact.\n\nThe main pillars are still in place: a 120-day blackout on refugees coming to the US, a 90-day ban on visas for travellers from six Muslim-majority countries (it had been seven, but Iraq was dropped), and a call for sterner, more consistent vetting standards moving forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly this time around, there shouldn\u2019t be as much airport chaos. All the necessary caveats and clarifications are clearly specified.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

Current green card holders can travel freely, as can people who have already had their visa requests accepted. So if you\u2019re approved for travel, you can still come \u2014 no risk of being held at the airport. Likewise, if you\u2019re currently living legally in America you can leave and return, without fear of being stranded.\n\nStill, just because the order is clear and implementation chaos-free doesn\u2019t mean that all issues have been resolved. There is still one great, unanswered question: is this executive order constitutional?\n\nCourts still need to rule on whether Trump\u2019s temporary ban on travelers from several majority-Muslim countries amounts to religious discrimination \u2014 a Muslim ban by another name. Or, alternately, is there some sound national security reason to single out these six nations?\n\nAs this larger fight wends its way through the courts \u2014 possibly all the way to the Supreme Court \u2014 the Trump administration has just shown that it has one big advantage. Whenever judges balk, the Trump administration can simply rewrite, tweaking their executive orders enough to pass legal muster, without much altering their ambitions.\n\nEvan Horowitz digs through data to find information that illuminates the policy issues facing Massachusetts and the US.
