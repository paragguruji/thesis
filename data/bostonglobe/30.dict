Chuang in federal court in Maryland marks another win for challengers of the president\u2019s executive order, which had been slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Earlier, a different federal judge in Hawaii stopped it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChuang\u2019s order did not sweep as broadly as the one in Hawaii, but he similarly declared that even the revised travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims. He said those wanting evidence of anti-Muslim intent need look no further than what the president himself has said about it.\n\nChuang\u2019s ruling won\u2019t upend or call into question the decision in Hawaii, instead offering some measure of reinforcement.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

He also mused a return to his original executive order, which imposed a more sweeping ban than the second.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u2019\u2019 Trump said. \u2018\u2018The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe first order temporarily barred entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and suspended the U.S. refugee program. When it was implemented, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some travelers affected while in transit were detained and deported from U.S. airports.\n\nOfficials had hoped the revised version would be more defensible in court. It reduced the list of countries affected to six - removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It also applied only to those seeking new visas, and spelled out a robust list of those who might be exempted. The new order maintained the suspension of the refugee program.\n\nOn Wednesday, with the order set to go into effect in just hours, federal judges in three separate states heard urgent challenges to the measure. The case in Maryland was brought by three organization and six people, claiming the order affected their work or prevented their family members from the affected countries from getting visas to enter the U.S.\n\nChuang blocked only the provision of the new order affecting the issuance of visas to those from the six affected countries. He said those suing had \u2018\u2018not provided a sufficient basis\u2019\u2019 for him to declare the other sections invalid.\n\nIn Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson had gone further, also suspending the portion of the order that affected refugees.\n\nHis ruling will be undisturbed by Chuang\u2019s, and appeals courts would ultimately have to decide to what extent each of them was right.\n\nJustice Department lawyers had argued the ban was necessary for national security. As evidence to support their claim, they pointed to a request from the U.S. attorney general and homeland security secretary - penned March 6, after the first ban had been frozen - asking for the measure. They also pointed to more than 300 people who they said entered the U.S. as refugees and were the subjects of counterterrorism investigations\n\nChuang wrote that he \u2018\u2018should not, and will not, second-guess the conclusion that national security interests would be served by the travel ban,\u2019\u2019 but if the national security rationale was secondary to an attempt to disfavor a particular religion, he had no choice but to block the executive order.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this highly unique case,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe same federal district court judge in Washington who blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban is also considering challenges to the new one.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "type": "article"}
