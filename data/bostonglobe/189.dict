Walsh. Within hours of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, he appeared with tens of thousands of protesters on Boston Common. When Trump threatened to slash funding to cities that refuse to aid federal deportation efforts, the mayor offered up his City Hall office as shelter to undocumented immigrants.\n\nAnd last weekend, amid a flurry of appearances on national television networks, Walsh was at protests at Logan Airport and Copley Square, lambasting Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on refugees and immigrants that spiraled into chaos, tears, and lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was Marty in his moment, taking on a somewhat unexpected political foe \u2014 not in Boston, but hundreds of miles away in the White House. His elevation to the national stage has, some say, raised questions about Walsh\u2019s own record on immigration record \u2014 but it also overshadowed a mayoral challenge from City Councilor Tito Jackson.\n\nMichael McCormack, a Boston lawyer and former city councilor, said Trump is taking up all the oxygen in this year\u2019s burgeoning mayoral race. The president is the perfect foil, McCormack said, and the mayor is taking advantage of it.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

For Marty Walsh it\u2019s a great place to be.\u201d\n\nWalsh, in an interview, said he is not thinking of politics \u2014 least of all this year\u2019s mayor\u2019s race \u2014 in voicing his outrage over what he sees as Trump\u2019s questionable policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal because I\u2019m the mayor of Boston, and over the last 20 years I\u2019ve represented people who come from different nationalities, different backgrounds, [people who] speak different languages,\u2019\u2019 said Walsh, the son of Irish immigrant parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson \u2014 who also participated in the women\u2019s march the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration and protests at Logan Airport, and took to the stage to rally demonstrators in Copley Square \u2014 appeared not to be bothered that Walsh is in the national spotlight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s par for the course,\u2019\u2019 Jackson said. \u201cI know that I have a message in uplifting all of Boston.\u201d\n\nHe said he would continue to wage a vigorous campaign in his quest to become the city\u2019s next mayor. He added that advocacy for immigrants and women\u2019s rights is not political but doing what is right and standing up for justice \u2014 something he said he has been doing all along.\n\n\u201cIf the mayor would like to run against Donald Trump, that\u2019s fine,\u2019\u2019 Jackson added. \u201cI will be running to uplift the people of Boston to deal with the issues that they face \u2014 [such as advocating for] jobs, a world-class education, affordable housing, and safe neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of immigration, Walsh has pledged to use all of his powers \u201cwithin lawful means\u201d to protect all Boston residents \u2014 even if that means using City Hall itself as a last resort.\n\nBut details about how much of the city\u2019s resources will go to those efforts remain unclear \u2014 in part, a Walsh\u2019s spokeswoman said, because the true impact of Trump\u2019s order is murky.\n\nImmigration advocates, while supportive of the mayor\u2019s salvos, have said the city has been slow to act on many of their key issues, including creating a policy against the establishment of databases with the names of Muslims and other immigrants and offering municipal identification for people who can\u2019t legally get a driver\u2019s license. The city recently announced it is seeking bids to \u201cstudy the feasibility\u201d of having the ID cards. New York began offering the cards in 2015.\n\nPatricia Montes, executive director of Centro Presente, an immigrant rights organization based in East Boston, said Walsh had been slow on immigration, but the city has picked up the pace recently through investments in groups like hers. She said she is proud the mayor is standing up to Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that he\u2019s doing this,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI hope he\u2019s doing it because he really cares about immigrants and not because he\u2019s running again.\u201d\n\nAfter the presidential election, Walsh, who backed Hillary Clinton, had comforted his staff and urged supporters to give Trump a chance. But after the whirl of last week\u2019s presidential orders, Walsh said felt he had no choice but to take on the president.\n\n\u201cFor six weeks, I was quiet,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said, referring to the days after the election. \u201cI said . . . let\u2019s see what the administration does. I still would like to give him a chance, but the actions of the last week were very difficult for me as a mayor of a major city. I can\u2019t sit idly by and let him do . . . damage\u2019\u2019 to the country.\n\nWalsh recalled that on the day of women\u2019s march in Boston, as he stood on the stage at Boston Common looking at the sea of supporters in pink hats and hoisting signs that carried notes of their worst fears, he was overcome.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cEveryone was there for a different issue, but everyone was there for the same reason.\u201d\n\nJames O\u2019Toole, a Boston College professor who studies local political history, said Walsh\u2019s big national moment is unusual for a first-term mayor, who normally is consumed by the nuts-and-bolts issues of running a city and getting reelected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little like stepping into some new territory for him,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Toole said. \u201cThat may be a measure of his confidence in how well he is doing for this city. He\u2019s certainly staked out what is an unusual role.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Toole recalled a famous 1970s dispute between President Ford and Mayor Abraham Beame, who was seeking federal relief for his cash-strapped New York City. Ford vowed to veto any bill calling for a federal bailout of New York, instead proposing legislation that would hasten the city\u2019s bankruptcy. A New York Daily News headline captured Ford\u2019s disdain: \u201cFord to City: Drop Dead.\u2019\u2019\n\nSo far, Trump has not responded specifically to any of Walsh\u2019s recent criticism of the president\u2019s policies. During the campaign, Trump spared no insults for the mayor, calling Walsh in one instance a clown and criticizing the city\u2019s failed Olympics bid.\n\nWalsh said that when it comes to immigration and other social issues he will not back down.\n\n\u201cI know I am a first-term mayor, but I\u2019ve been in this job now for the past three years,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said. \u201cWe still are very involved in the nuts and bolts issues. But this is about the future of this country.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
