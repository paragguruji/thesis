But his visa was suspended in January when President Trump issued his first travel ban, barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, from entering the United States.\n\nAfter joining a lawsuit challenging the ban, and receiving support from local political leaders, Saravi\u2019s visa was restored in March and his wife\u2019s was issued several months later, allowing her to accompany him to Boston as his spouse.\n\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff Soheil Saravi.\n\nSaravi, 31, plans to spend two years as a postdoctoral fellow studying the effects of diabetes on the heart. He will also be a researcher at Harvard Medical School, which is affiliated with the Brigham.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to come to the United States to continue my scientific training here,\u201d Saravi said, reading softly from a statement he had written on his phone. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve wanted to come to Boston and study and work at Harvard University and to learn from the great doctors and scientists here, like Professor Michel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichel said he was also moved.\n\n\u201cI view Dr. Saravi\u2019s arrival as a victory for the universality of science, the persistence and dedication of one individual, and the fact that Boston is a city that has traditionally welcomed the best and brightest to come here and study,\u201d he said.\n\nSaravi was one of a number of highly educated foreigners whose lives were disrupted by the ban. In addition to the suspension of his visa, he said he lost financial support for his research and had to scramble for new sponsors. Adding to his travails, he suffered health problems that required two surgeries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m here now, but I should say that some actions, like the travel ban, aren\u2019t reasonable for Iranians who love peace, culture, literature, and humanity,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff Colin Ferguson of Watertown and Dr. Thomas Michel played in Terminal E as they waited for Saravi to arrive.\n\nMichel said he wanted his colleagues and friends to play music with him in Terminal E so Saravi would feel welcomed when he arrived in Boston. One held a sign that read, \u201cWelcome Soheil and Khatareh. Science Transcends Borders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to playing the Iranian folk tune, which he learned on the spot from an Iranian couple in the terminal, Michel used his accordion, nicknamed Rosie, to squeeze out a medley of patriotic American tunes, including \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis behavior is like a dad,\u201d Saravi said, laughing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special guy with a lot of skill,\u201d Michel said.\n\nDespite the joy of the moment, Michel said he remains deeply worried about the future of scientific research in the Trump era. He pointed to Trump\u2019s plans to cut research funding, his harsh rhetoric about immigrants, and his latest travel ban, issued Sunday.\n\nBeginning Oct. 18, Trump\u2019s new policy will bar entry to most citizens of seven countries: North Korea, Chad, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Libya, and Iran. Venezuelans and Iraqis will face heightened scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re looking at the beginning of the end of America\u2019s leadership in science if the current policies are going to be pursued,\u201d Michel said.\n\nBut he said he was glad, at least, that Saravi can begin his research in Boston.\n\nSaravi said he was eager to find an apartment, get to work, and put the frustrations of the travel ban behind him.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m really stronger than before because I\u2019ve passed many limitations, many restrictions,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Levenson can be reached at mlevenson@globe.com .
