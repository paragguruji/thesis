The order excludes certain visa holders, but the amicus brief notes that many academics rely on visas that would be affected.\n\nThe order is the second attempt by the Trump administration to crack down on travel into the United States from Muslim-majority countries the administration has linked to terrorism. Trump\u2019s first ban, signed on Jan. 27, was more expansive and was struck down in February by a court in Seattle.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The Fourth Circuit court in Richmond, where the universities filed their amicus brief, also ruled against the ban. Trump has appealed, and the Richmond court has a hearing set for May 8.\n\nIn addition to Harvard, MIT, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts is represented in the brief, dated March 31, by Boston University, Brandeis University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University.\n\n\u201cAs the court considers the legal challenge to the executive order, we thought it important to have our voice heard about the significant impact the executive order has had \u2013 and will have \u2013 on colleges and universities,\u201d said Robert W. Iuliano, senior vice president and general counsel at Harvard University, in a statement. \u201cHarvard\u2019s mission and academic interests are global and we are at our best when the best students and faculty from across the world join together to solve problems for the benefit of society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe schools draw deeply from international talent, the amicus brief argues. At MIT, for example, more than 40 percent of faculty members are international; At Princeton, 30 percent of faculty appointees are international.\n\nIn the 2015-2016 academic year, the brief states, the United States welcomed more than a million international students who represent more than 5 percent of enrollment at institutions of higher learning.\n\nThe presence of international students, faculty, and scholars at universities across the country creates environments of collaboration and understanding, where people bring different perspectives that deepen and enliven academic thought, the brief argues. Many international students educated here stay and create art, businesses, or scientific advancements; others return to their countries, bringing traditional American ideals like democratic governance and respect for human rights with them.\n\nThe brief listed a long roster of foreign leaders who were educated in the United States, including MIT alums Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel; and Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations; and Lucas Papademos, former prime minister of Greece. Since 2000, the brief argued, 40 percent of all American Nobel prize winners in chemistry, medicine, and physics have been immigrants.\n\nInternational students not only contribute to American innovation, but to the economy, the brief argued, citing an estimate that international students directly contributed $32.8 billion to the United States economy and supported or contributed to the creation of 400,000 American jobs in the 2015 to 2016 academic year.\n\nThe universities already are being hurt by the ban, the brief argued, with prospective students and faculty members reconsidering their plans. Many admissions letters for fall 2017 have been sent out, and some prospective international students have chosen not to attend school in the United States for fear that they will not be able to obtain visas.\n\n\u201cAn amicus brief provides the opportunity for institutions that are not parties to a case to present additional facts that they believe will assist the court in reaching a just result,\u201d said Erika Geetter, BU vice president and general cousel, in a statement. \u201cIn this case, the universities were able to give many concrete examples of the ways in which the blanket ban on individuals from the specified countries had far-reaching implications for our educational missions.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the brief argues, the ban undercuts efforts to create a culture of diversity, inclusion, and tolerance.\n\nThe executive order, the brief argues, signals \u201cfrom the highest levels of government, that discrimination is not only acceptable but appropriate.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-01", "type": "article"}
