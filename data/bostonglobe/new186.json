The judges also instructed Customs and Border Protection to notify airlines overseas that it is safe to put immigrants on US-bound flights.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

They arrived at Logan around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and were held \u201csolely pursuant to an executive order issued\u201d by Trump, the petition said.\n\nThough the professors were released, lawyers rushed to federal court fearing more people could be barred in the days ahead.\n\nThe judges agreed, ruling that the lawyers had established a \u201cstrong likelihood of success\u201d that Trump\u2019s order would violate immigrants\u2019 constitutional rights and said immigrants are \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm\u201d as a result of the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe balance of harms favors the issuance of this temporary restraining order and its issuance is in the public interest,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe immigration lawyers, who had conferred with one another for hours in the dimly lit hallways of Boston\u2019s federal court late Saturday night into Sunday morning, cheered the victory and said they hoped to make the restraining order permanent.\n\n\u201cThis is an illegal, unconstitutional executive order and if the president continues to go forward with these kinds of plans we\u2019re going to continue to fight him every step of the way,\u201d said Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, in a press conference after the hearing.\n\nLawyer Kerry Doyle added, \u201cThis is our first victory and our first day in court, or night in court as the case may be, but it won\u2019t be the last one.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed on Friday, bars immigrants from the seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, and halts refugees worldwide from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtests ensued around the country, including at Logan, where hundreds of people gathered Saturday night chanting, \u201cLet them in.\u201d\n\nAlso Saturday night, a federal judge in New York ruled that refugees and non-US citizens who have been detained at airports across the country should not be deported. A court in Virginia also issued a ruling on the order, according to media reports.\n\nIn Boston, lawyers, mostly women, rushed to federal court around 10 p.m., some still in fancy dresses from parties and galas or a Saturday night on the town.\n\nLawyer Sue Finegan left gala to come to the court. Susan Cohen ditched a 60th birthday party. And Laura Rotolo of the ACLU left her husband and two children to clean up at after her 6-year-old\u2019s birthday party. Doyle carried a copy of the Immigration and Nationality Act under her arm, and lawyer Melissa Smith handed out Girl Scout cookies \u2014 Thin Mints \u2014 for sustenance.\n\n\u201cWe all raced over to help,\u201d Finegan said.\n\nCourt officers also were called in from home, including one who had been eating chocolate ice cream and watching the news before he got the call. And federal prosecutor Ray Farquhar, acting chief of the civil division, put down his wine glass at an engagement party and rushed into court.\n\nHe argued that the lawsuit was moot because the professors had been released, but he said the US Attorney\u2019s office was trying to find a reasonable solution to an issue that had abruptly appeared on their radar.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said more immigrants from the countries on Trump\u2019s list are expected to arrive in Boston first thing Sunday, which could be the first test of the judges\u2019 ruling.\n\nGlobe correspondent Felicia Gans contributed to this report.
