Foreign-born scientists within the United States fear similar orders could be issued without warning, and some have expressed anxiety about deportation or losing family ties. Ultimately, the letter argues, the policy will harm patients and the US economy.\n\n\u2018\u2018Though the ban from the Trump administration is aimed at seven countries, our global employees interpret the underlying message as, \u2018America is no longer welcoming of any immigrants, whatsoever,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 wrote chief executives, venture capitalists, academic leaders, and at least one Nobel Prize winner. \u2018\u2018If this misguided policy is not reversed, America is at risk of losing its leadership position in one of its most important sectors, one that will shape the world in the twenty-first century.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter, a grass-roots effort organized late last week by a half dozen chief executives, starkly contrasts the tone that the leaders of major pharmaceutical companies set in a meeting last week with Trump. The executives came away from that meeting emphasizing the common ground they had with Trump on many issues. It was unclear whether the travel ban was discussed in the private portion of the meeting. However, in the run-up, the industry\u2019s major trade group did not take a position and the companies that did respond were often supportive of employees, but neutral.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

As science has advanced, biotech has become an increasingly broad term for the research-driven, startup-heavy wing of the drug industry trying to turn cutting-edge science into medicines. As the research and development pipelines of traditional drug companies have dried up, biotech has become increasingly important \u2014 economically and to the development of medicines.\n\nAt the same time, the biotech industry has been heavily reliant on immigrants; 52 percent of the 69,000 biomedical researchers in the United States were born abroad, according to one study.\n\n\u2018\u2018Without those immigrants, cancer treatment today would never be in the kind of position that it is today,\u2019\u2019 Jeremy Levin, chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics, said. \u2018\u2018For me, the core of innovation \u2014 the heart of innovation \u2014 resides in America. It resides here because of the borders that we\u2019ve opened to these scientists that have come from abroad; it resides here because of the tremendous capital and infrastructure we\u2019ve built.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter-writing effort began informally, when late last week half a dozen colleagues, including Holtzman and Levin, decided they needed to say something about Trump\u2019s executive order. They drafted the letter collectively and sent it out to colleagues over the weekend to see if any would sign on. It quickly went viral; they accumulated more than 160 signatures over 96 hours.\n\nHoltzman said his mother came to the United States from Cuba as a child and his father\u2019s family came to escape religious persecution. Neither of his parents graduated from high school, and yet Holtzman has been involved in creating medicines at six biotechnology companies. His current company, a year-old startup, has about 40 employees \u2014 a quarter of whom are either first-generation or foreign born.\n\n\u2018\u2018Could such a story be told in Trump\u2019s America?\u2019\u2019 Holtzman asked.\n\nLevin is both an immigrant and a refugee. His family was expelled from South Africa during apartheid when he was a child. He also believes that he knows the threat terrorism poses more personally than some. As the former chief executive of generic drug company Teva Pharmaceuticals, he recalls touring a factory in Israel on the border while rockets were being fired by Hamas.\n\n\u2018\u2018I believe you hunt down and destroy terrorism,\u2019\u2019 Levin said. \u2018\u2018I know it more than most people who are in my industry, because I experienced it.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the executives agree upon is that the executive order could have far-reaching effects on American business and on the health of sick people.\n\n\u2018Without those immi-grants, cancer treatment today would never be in the kind of position that it is.\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018It will harm an industry dominated by smaller companies and startups, the very kind of industry the administration has said it wants to support,\u2019\u2019 the letter states. \u2018\u2018It will slow the fight against the many diseases that afflict us, as well as carry negative economic consequences for the United States.\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Carolyn Y.
