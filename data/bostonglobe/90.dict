One bookstore in Brookline is voicing its opposition through a new window display, which features writers from the seven countries included in the ban.\n\nDana Brigham, co-owner of Brookline Booksmith, said the idea came to them Monday.

With this ban, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. These voices aren\u2019t being heard; they\u2019re being censored.\u201d\n\nThe showcased books were selected primarily because of where their authors are from, but it\u2019s fitting that so many of them deal with immigration and oppression, she said.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.
