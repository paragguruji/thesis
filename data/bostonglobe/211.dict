Orrick\u2019s order will remain in place while the civil action brought by San Francisco and Santa Clara counties is pending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge wrote that federal funding that \u201cbears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves.\u2019\u2019\n\nMayor Martin J. Walsh, who previously pledged to shelter immigrants in Boston City Hall if necessary to fight Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, praised Orrick\u2019s order in a statement.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

A federal appeals court previously blocked his proposed travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, and a revised version has also stalled in court.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the order on sanctuary cities as a way to keep dangerous criminals off the street and protect national security.\n\nOn Tuesday night, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said the ruling was \u201canother example of how the Ninth Circuit went bananas,\u201d referring to the appellate jurisdiction where the case was heard. Orrick does not actually sit on the Ninth Circuit appeals court.\n\nPriebus predicted the ruling would be overturned.\n\nThe Department of Justice, reflecting the administration\u2019s objection to the latest legal setback, said Tuesday that it will enforce existing conditions on federal grants that require compliance with the law that forbids communities from blocking reports on people\u2019s immigration status to federal authorities.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that said federal funding could be denied to any jurisdiction that refused to hand over unauthorized immigrants for deportation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions later elaborated, speaking about withholding Department of Justice grants, which are expected to total more than $4.1 billion this year.\n\nThere is no official definition of a sanctuary city, but in general, such municipalities do not allow their police departments to help ICE detain and deport immigrants.\n\nMany officials in Massachusetts communities with large numbers of immigrants, including Curtatone, Walsh, and Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera, have defended their cities\u2019 enforcement practices in the face of possible funding cuts.\n\nThe Boston-based Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, which represents Lawrence and Chelsea in a related federal lawsuit in Massachusetts, also praised Orrick\u2019s ruling on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSanctuary policies reflect the local judgment that communities are more safe when local police are not entangled in federal immigration enforcement,\u201d the Lawyers\u2019 Committee said in a statement.\n\nRivera could not be reached for comment on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump tweeted earlier Tuesday that he remained steadfast on another hot-button immigration policy \u2014 his plan to build a wall along the US border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has said his executive order on sanctuary cities is also aimed at fighting crime. Sessions asserted in March that in one week there had been more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor ICE detainer requests, including in cases where people had been charged with crimes such as murder and sexual offenses against children.\n\nBut Gorrick wrote in his order Tuesday that Trump\u2019s executive order runs afoul of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe defunding provision is entirely inconsistent with law in its stated purpose and directives because it instructs the Attorney General and the Secretary to do something that only Congress has the authority to do \u2014 place new conditions on federal funds,\u201d Gorrick wrote.\n\nHe added that the president \u201cdoes not have the power to place conditions on federal funds and so cannot delegate this power.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-25", "type": "article"}
