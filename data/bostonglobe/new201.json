Citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya would be banned from entering the U.S. for the period, while the government determines what information it needs to safely admit visitors.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a directive on Friday afternoon ordering the Customs and Border Control agency to enforce the order, the New York Daily News reported. Late Friday, some green card and visa holders were already being blocked from boarding flights to the U.S., the newspaper said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSome Google employees were traveling abroad and were trying to get back to the U.S. before the order took effect. The company asked them to reach out to Google\u2019s security, travel, and immigration teams for assistance, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person asked not to be identified talking about internal company communications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe employees in question normally work in the U.S. but just happened to be abroad either on work assignments or vacations. The concern is that even if Google staff have valid visas, they may still be at risk if they\u2019re from one of the seven countries and they\u2019re outside the U.S. when the order kicks in, the person also said.\n\nOne employee rushed back from a trip to New Zealand to make it into the U.S. before the order was signed, Google\u2019s Pichai wrote in his memo.\n\n\u201cWe are advising our clients from those seven countries who have green cards or any type of H-1B visa not to travel outside the U.S.\u201d said Ava Benach, a partner at immigration law firm Benach Collopy LLP, while noting that the order takes effect immediately.\n\n\u201cNo one is really sure whether a green card holder from these seven countries can return to the U.S. now. It\u2019s fairly clear that an H-1B visa holder can\u2019t,\u201d Benach said. The H-1B lets U.S. companies employ graduate-level workers from other countries in technical occupations such as technology, engineering and science.\n\n\u201cIf anyone in these situations has the misfortune to have gone abroad recently, it\u2019s a treacherous moment, possibly for green card holders too,\u201d Benach said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther technology companies are likely in a similar situation, she added.\n\nFacebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Friday he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s recent moves to restrict immigration.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. inserted language in a securities filing on Thursday on the issue, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions \u201cmay inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.\u201d", "authors": ["Mark Bergen", "Bloomberg News"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["executive", "seven", "immigration", "employees", "google", "members", "trumps", "countries", "staff", "green", "order", "pichai", "recalls"], "summary": "Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai slammed Trump\u2019s move in a note to employees Friday, telling them that more than 100 company staff are affected by the order.\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d Pichai wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.\nSign up for more newsletters hereTrump signed an executive order Friday prohibiting entry by people from seven majority-Muslim nations for 90 days.\n\u201cNo one is really sure whether a green card holder from these seven countries can return to the U.S. now.\nFacebook Inc.
