The ban issued Monday would bar new visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily shut down America\u2019s refugee program. It leaves Iraq off the list but affects people from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya. It goes into effect March 16.\n\nHealey, who joined a lawsuit over the original version of the ban, wasn\u2019t the only Massachusetts Democrat voicing opposition.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Edward Markey calls the ban discriminatory and says it will serve as a \u2018\u2018recruitment tool\u2019\u2019 for terrorists. Congressman Seth Moulton says the ban targets men, women, and children fleeing persecution.\n\nBoston Mayor Martin Walsh says the city will stand by its immigrant community.\n\n\u201cWhile this administration is packaging this as a new and improved executive order, it is the same ban that discriminates against the same people. It was wrong the first time and it\u2019s wrong the second,\u201d Walsh said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation said Monday that changes to Trump\u2019s revised travel ban still left them feeling as if it was more about politics than security.\n\nU.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said she supported improving the vetting process but didn\u2019t believe the revised ban would achieve that. She noted that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \u2018\u2018own analysis showed no intelligence basis for the ban, and former defense and intelligence officials from both parties have said that the ban would make us less safe.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Despite the changes, this is just another attempt by the Trump Administration at a backdoor Muslim ban \u2014 with Trump\u2019s own advisers admitting that the goals are the same as his previous executive order,\u2019\u2019 Hassan said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who met with an Iraqi refugee and his family at their grocery store in Manchester on Monday, said, \u2018\u2018Arbitrarily imposing travel restrictions on certain Muslim-majority countries only makes us less safe by reinforcing terrorist propaganda and recruitment.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018President Trump is recklessly pursuing a campaign promise at the expense of fundamental American values and our safety,\u2019\u2019 Shaheen said. \u2018\u2018The Trump administration\u2019s decision to delay this revised ban in order to maximize positive press coverage sends a clear message that this directive is about politics, not national security.\u2019\u2019\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s two representatives each released statements condemning the ban.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
