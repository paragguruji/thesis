One imagines that Trump will administer the test at one of his rally-style events, where he\u2019ll read the questions aloud to crowds of would-be Americans:\n\n[Trump enters, pumps fists, claps, points.] \u201cUSA! USA! Thank you! Thank you! What a crowd! There must be, what, 300 million people here? Listen to this applause. Are you hearing this? Let them all in. USA! USA!\n\n\u201cOK, we have to get started here. I have to read this quiz. It\u2019s an excellent quiz, by the way. My lovely daughter Ivanka worked on it. Come here, Ivanka. Isn\u2019t she beautiful? If you\u2019re lucky, and you make it into this country, maybe you\u2019ll meet an Ivanka. But probably not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOK, OK. Please answer as close to truthfully as possible and add up your scores below. If you\u2019re having trouble with the math, we have Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to help you out. \u2018Secretary Munchkin,\u2019 I like to call him. You don\u2019t know what that is because you come from countries where they don\u2019t play \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 but you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s a tremendous movie about real estate, about a house that falls on a witch. I can think of a witch I\u2019d like a house to fall on. USA!

So be nice. OK. Here we go. Write down your scores if you have the following:\n\n\u201cA low golf handicap? 100 points. A physical handicap? Minus 100 points. Blonde hair? 150 points. No sweetheart. You don\u2019t have blonde hair. I\u2019m talking really light, really straight blonde hair, like Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s. You know her? Terrific gal, she\u2019s anchoring \u2018Trump TV.\u2019\n\n\u201cAre you compassionate? Subtract 60 points. You know who\u2019s compassionate? Nice guys. And we know where they finish, right? Last. Exactly. Who said that? Applaud that. [He claps.] We should just let him in. He looks OK. What\u2019s your name? What? I can\u2019t pronounce that. What about Toby? You like that name? If you get in, we\u2019re going to call you Toby. Believe me, life will be much easier for you as Toby.\n\n\u201cWhere was I? Are you a snazzy dresser? 100 points. Can you dance to \u2018Despacito\u2019? 500 points. In heels? Lemme see those. Oh, those are heels. Look at that. If you can wear heels like that, if you\u2019re female, you get 300 points; men, minus 300 points. We don\u2019t need any more of those here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo friends say you look terrific in a shiny sash? I mean really, really terrific? 1,000 points. Are you a . . . what\u2019s this word? I can\u2019t read my own writing. I\u2019ll sound it out. Are you a vo-ra-cious reader? Minus 200 points.\n\n\u201cOK, are you: Tall? 1,000 points. Buxom? 500 points? Tall and Buxom? Lucky him! Who is that? Is that your boyfriend? Are you willing to relocate to Washington? Like, now? I\u2019ll send a car.\n\n\u201cAre you unattractive? It\u2019s a brutal, brutal world. Intellectually curious? Enjoy France. Fluent in many languages? Nobody likes a show-off. Are you willing to sacrifice for your neighbor or the good of the community? Minus 500 points.\n\n\u201cDo you hope to work as a journalist? Let yourself out. A librarian? Speak up, I can\u2019t hear you. Just kidding. Get a ride home with the journalist. A teacher? Those other two probably have a Prius, but maybe you can squeeze in.\n\n\u201cOK. That\u2019s it. I can still get in nine holes. We\u2019ll pick this up later. And, incidentally, if any of you have experience in politics, I may need another running mate. Stay tuned.\u201d\n\nDebra A. Klein is a writer in San Francisco.
