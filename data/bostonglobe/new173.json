Less than an hour later, the Massachusetts chapter of a leading Islamic civil rights group sent out an alert urging protesters to gather at Copley Square that Sunday.\n\nTheir call was like a stone tossed into a pond, creating ripples amplified by social media. Organizers anticipated about 1,000 people would protest. Instead, tens of thousands arrived in a phalanx of support and solidarity.\n\n\u201cPeople were coming in from Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Vermont,\u201d said John Robbins, the executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cWe had 20,000 who said they came on Facebook \u2014 that was purely folks who had checked in \u2014 so probably far more than that showed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtester. Activist. Agitator. No longer are such labels seen as solely subversive descriptions for radicals who question authority \u2014 they are also badges of honor for those who support causes they believe in, say organizers and those who study the nation\u2019s social movements. They cite a cultural shift, starting with the Arab Spring and Occupy movement in 2011 and continuing with Black Lives Matter, that has swept through much of the country, making protests almost commonplace in ways not seen since the 1960s.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Demonstrators have fought against building oil pipelines. Marchers have taken to the streets to stop police brutality. Antiabortion activists have rallied in the nation\u2019s capital. Women have marched. And scientists plan to march.\n\n\u201cMarches and rallies [have] just become an increasingly accepted way of engaging in politics,\u201d said Rory McVeigh, the director of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Center for the Study of Social Movements. \u201cIf you have a grievance, you band together and you make your voices heard. It\u2019s not shocking anymore.\u201d\n\nPart of that has to do with the current generation learning lessons from the activists who came before them, said Sarah J. Jackson, a professor at Northeastern University who studies how activists use and are presented in media.\n\nMillennials, she said, were raised to believe that those who boycotted, marched, and committed acts of civil disobedience helped right many of the country\u2019s wrongs. History teaches them that those who protested the Vietnam War and took part in the civil rights struggle and fight for women\u2019s rights \u201cwere right and just,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, millennials are coming to terms with the fact that inequality still exists, she said, as social media reconciles reality with perception.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking around and seeing that progress isn\u2019t linear,\u201d Jackson said\n\nAnd while pirate radio \u2014 as in unlicensed, low-wattage stations \u2014 might have been the organizing tool for activist of old, Jackson said, social media is now the go-to for today\u2019s organizer.\n\nWord spreads about nearly every demonstration through Twitter, Facebook, and other social media, which can cause attendance to balloon.\n\nBut technology is not a substitute for the on-the-ground work that is crucial to social justice movements, said Horace Small, executive director of the advocacy group, the Union of Minority Neighborhoods. Organizers must talk to a broad swath of people to bring about legislative change, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou have a right to protest. You have a right to speak out. But if you\u2019re doing a tactic for the sake of being seen and heard, one can make the argument it\u2019s a failed tactic,\u201d Small said. \u201cIn real organizing, all tactics have a connection to a strategy. That\u2019s the real deal.\u201d\n\nRobbins said the Council on American-Islamic Relations had been trying to determine how best to respond should Trump make good on his controversial campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the country.\n\nThe day after the inauguration, about 100,000 people participated in the women\u2019s march in Boston \u2014 part of nearly 5 million people who organizers said protested worldwide. That demonstration, which historians say could be the largest single-day protest in US history, started from a Facebook post authored by a woman in Hawaii, after Trump was elected in November.\n\nAfter he saw the turnout of the women\u2019s march, Robbins said, the council wanted to \u201ccapitalize on some of the energy\u201d generated by the massive gathering.\n\nSo they picked the place where their yet-to-be scheduled rally would be held: the Kahlil Gibran Memorial at Copley Square. Gibran was a famous artist and philosopher whose family emigrated from Lebanon in 1895.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was a really prominent way to show that an immigrant from the Middle East had left such a strong footprint on Boston in such a prominent way,\u201d Robbins said.\n\nThey decided a Muslim prayer would be said.\n\nThen, they waited.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the wait ended. Just one week into Trump\u2019s administration, the president signed an executive order that halted all refugee arrivals for 120 days, bars citizens from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, and blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAt 5:44 p.m. \u2014 an hour after the order was signed \u2014 the organization e-mailed its members with an announcement about the protest that Sunday and created a Facebook event for it.\n\nThe comments began within minutes. Most users expressed support for the protest, even if they regretted not being able to attend. Just one of the earliest commenters took exception to calling Trump\u2019s order \u201ca ban.\u201d\n\nBut Saturday evening, as word spread that travelers with valid visas and green cards were being barred from boarding planes and entering the country, new posts began to appear, alerting people to an \u201cEMERGENCY ACTION\u201d at Logan International Airport. It was a separate protest organized by a different group, but it got the attention of Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Attorney General Maura Healey, and other elected officials.\n\nRobbins said his group started reaching out to elected officials \u2014 and receiving calls from them as well \u2014 wondering if any wanted to speak at Sunday\u2019s event. They did.\n\nWarren spoke. Walsh spoke. City Councilor Tito Jackson spoke. US Senator Edward Markey spoke.\n\nBut what now?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Robbins said.\n\nHe\u2019s committed to making sure the momentum from the massive protest on Jan. 29 doesn\u2019t fizzle, saying his group collected the contact information for more than 10,000 people. (Boston police put the crowd at about 15,000.)\n\nThey\u2019re urging them to lobby legislators to support initiatives that include defending immigrants and protecting the freedom of religion.\n\nAnd that \u2014 creating a cultural and political shift \u2014 is what a social movement is all about, said Small. Otherwise, he said, \u201cit\u2019s bull, to be perfectly candid.\u201d\n\nAkilah Johnson can be reached at akilah.johnson@globe.com .
