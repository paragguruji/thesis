But one can certainly count on lawsuits challenging the new order\u2019s constitutionality. While now more limited in scope, the order still reeks of discriminatory intent, and deserves the same fate as its predecessors: a quick rejection by federal courts.\n\nThe new order bars travelers from six, not the original seven, Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen \u2014 from getting new visas for 90 days. (Iraq was left out because its government undertook what the administration vaguely termed as \u201csteps to provide additional information about its citizens for purposes of our immigration decision,\u201d according to a document provided by the Trump administration.) The new policy doesn\u2019t take effect until March 16 and also temporarily shuts down the country\u2019s refugee program.\n\nThe order offers a feeble justification for the ban, attempting to make a case that the policy is based on national security concerns. But the stubborn fact is that not a single American has been killed on US soil as a result of a terror attack by a foreign national from any of the six countries, making it difficult to argue that the ban has a basis in reality. As for its halt to the refugee program, Trump says \u201cterrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs,\u201d hence the need to suspend ours. Never mind that the State Department, not foreign countries, vets refugees. A recent Cato Institute report showed that the probability of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion. The administration has also argued, apparently with a straight face, that because some predominantly Muslim countries were not included in the list, the policy\u2019s intent could not possibly be discriminatory. (Fun fact: not every single bathroom was segregated under Jim Crow.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe administration\u2019s arguments sound like half-baked rationalizations cooked up to justify the Muslim ban Trump promised in the campaign and to obscure its intent. Common sense suggests that\u2019s just what they are, and so does the evidence: Indeed, the most difficult obstacles administration lawyers will face in defending the order are Trump\u2019s own words, which make his illegal intent perfectly clear.\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

We\u2019ll call it territories, okay?\u201d he said at one point.\n\nTrump can change the executive order, but he can\u2019t unsay his own words. And, as one of the court rulings striking down the first ban made clear, the courts must consider the overall context, including the words of public officials involved, when assessing whether a government action had discriminatory intent. Trump all but announced he would seek to ban Muslims and then call the policy something else. Judges have a responsibility to see through this bigoted charade. Striking down the ban was an easy call for the federal courts the first time around. It should be another easy call now.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["administration", "trump", "ban", "refugee", "intent", "countries", "words", "order", "muslim", "policy"], "summary": "(Iraq was left out because its government undertook what the administration vaguely termed as \u201csteps to provide additional information about its citizens for purposes of our immigration decision,\u201d according to a document provided by the Trump administration.)\nThe order offers a feeble justification for the ban, attempting to make a case that the policy is based on national security concerns.\nThe administration has also argued, apparently with a straight face, that because some predominantly Muslim countries were not included in the list, the policy\u2019s intent could not possibly be discriminatory.\nAdvertisementThe administration\u2019s arguments sound like half-baked rationalizations cooked up to justify the Muslim ban Trump promised in the campaign and to obscure its intent.\nTrump all but announced he would seek to ban Muslims and then call the policy something else."}
