At least 1,000 Yemeni-run small businesses are a part of many New Yorkers\u2019 daily lives, said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who planned to attend the rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaron Zokari closed his Manhattan deli at noon, as well. He said his wife and baby are stuck in Yemen after almost completing a four-year, green-card process.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are trying to stay strong,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s people there who are refugees and who are starving and running for their lives, so thank God we don\u2019t have it as bad as they do.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order barred people from Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria from entering the U.S. for 90 days. Under the order, travelers have been detained, sent back from the United States or stranded in other countries.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images Men prayed during a protest by ethinic Yemenis and supporters over President Donald Trump's executive order.\n\nZaid Nagi, who owns three delis in the Bronx, said the ban disrupted plans to bring his mother to the United States, where he has lived for more than 20 years. The 36-year-old married father of four said the point of the protest was to say, \u2018\u2018We are part of this community. We are not who this order is trying to say we are.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said most of his customers had expressed solidarity with the shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018They know who we are. They know we are human beings just like them,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I believe in the good people of America.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs night fell, a raucous but orderly crowd of at least 1,000 people including many of the shopkeepers filled a plaza in Brooklyn to protest the travel ban.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.
