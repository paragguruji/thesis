But the court made an exception for people with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d in the United States, such as an offer of employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe would-be Boston Children\u2019s researcher, Dr. Mohsen Dehnavi, was detained Monday after arriving at Logan Airport with his wife and three children. They were sent back Tuesday night, even though Dehnavi had a J-1 visa for visiting scholars.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection said Dehnavi\u2019s detention was unrelated to the president\u2019s executive order banning travel from Iran and five other countries. The agency never gave a reason for sending Dehnavi back, citing privacy rules, and Children\u2019s officials said Dehnavi\u2019s visa had been approved by the State Department before he left Iran. The hospital said it had no additional information about why he was turned away.\n\nIranian state television reported Thursday that Dehnavi previously headed a student branch of a volunteer paramilitary militia, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDehnavi said on arrival in Tehran that he and his family had been detained for around 30 hours in Boston.\n\n\u201cThey kept me and my family under detention-like conditions for 28 to 30 hours in a room,\u201d he said in the TV report quoted by AP. \u201cThey didn\u2019t allow us to call anyone or exit the room.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe incident renewed fears for Michel, the Brigham cardiologist. The researcher scheduled to work in his lab, Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, had his visa revoked in January after President Trump\u2019s first executive order. Saravi\u2019s visa has since been reinstated and he is scheduled to start work in Michel\u2019s lab in September \u2014 but Saravi is still waiting for a visa for his wife.\n\nIf he gets to Boston, Saravi \u2014 whom Michel described as \u201cone of the top young life sciences PhDs in all of Iran\u201d \u2014 will spend two years researching the effects of diabetes on the heart.\n\n\u201cThe delay in his arrival to my lab has undermined research,\u201d Michel said. \u201cTo deny the opportunity for these talented people to come here and contribute is very short-sighted and will ultimately undermine American science.\u201d\n\nThe travel ban could also affect medical school graduates seeking to pursue postgraduate training at American hospitals.\n\nThe University of Massachusetts Medical School this month welcomed three residents from the countries targeted by the executive order, one each from Iran, Sudan, and Syria.\n\n\u201cAll three were, however, already in the US, with visa status appropriate for working as resident physician trainees, and they all began their residencies here without incident,\u201d UMass spokesman Mark L. Shelton said in an e-mail. UMass has also offered positions to two faculty members from the affected countries.\n\nDr. Jatin Vyas, director of the internal medicine residency program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said he is worried about the future residents, who will begin applying for positions in September.\n\nIn the past, he said, the United States \u201csent a strong positive invitation to the rest of the world that we were interested in the very best coming here. Now that invitation is quite muted.\u201d As a result talented people are considering the United Kingdom or Canada instead.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing they could do is commit to a research program, and find out in the middle of that time that they\u2019re no longer welcome here,\u201d Vyas said.\n\nAyer, the director of the Partners international office, said that despite the current climate \u2014 the most inhospitable she has ever seen \u2014 she is confident that the fervor to pursue science and medicine will overcome the political obstacles.\n\n\u201cScience knows no nationality,\u201d Ayer said.\n\nFelice J.
