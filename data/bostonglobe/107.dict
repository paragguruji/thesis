Trump\u2019s controversial immigration restrictions, affirming the ruling of a lower court in Seattle. That means the president will not be able to enforce his executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, as well as refugees from around the world.\n\nTrump himself has repeatedly criticized the courts overseeing this case, referring at different times to the \u201cso-called judge\u201d in Seattle and the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d proceedings of the appeals court. But this is all still Round 1, with miles to go before the legal fight is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider, for instance, that all this wrangling is still about preliminary matters. It\u2019s not yet a question of whether Trump\u2019s immigration orders are constitutional, merely what should happen while the courts try to figue out if they\u2019re constitutional. Should the orders go into force now, or await a final ruling.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the Trump team will respond with a further appeal to the Supreme Court, but that too would be about this preliminary question. As yet, no hearing on the actual merits has taken place.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

Trump will have hundreds of years of precedent pushing down upon him, pressing him to accept the will of the judiciary, even if it cuts against his wishes on immigration.\n\nExcept that Trump doesn\u2019t seem to respect precedent all that much. At least, not when it comes to releasing tax returns, eliminating conflicts of interest, or relying on relatives for advice.\n\nWhat if he breaks from precedent here, too, refusing to accept unfavorable court rulings? What happens if his sense of personal mission is simply too strong, particularly when it comes to immigration, where \u2014 as he put it in a tweet Thursday night (in all caps) -- \u201cTHE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch fears were already circulating, particularly last week when several lawmakers were apparently denied court-authorized access to detained immigrants. In that case, the real culprit turned out to be sloppy implementation, not open defiance, but the concern was lit. And it has been kept alight by the growing understanding that if Trump decides to defy the courts, there will be no ready remedy.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a situation in modern American history where the courts ruled and the president refused to comply (Andrew Jackson came close, but that was nearly 200 years ago). That\u2019s lucky, because a showdown between the executive and judicial branches could set off what\u2019s called a \u201cconstitutional crisis,\u201d a fight for power with no clear referee.\n\nThink of it this way. Usually, the president and the courts work in tandem, with the president helping to enforce judicial rulings. But if the president refuses to enforce a ruling he finds illegitimate, what can the courts do then? They could hold him in contempt, but so what? And while they could try to enforce their own ruling using US marshals \u2014 who work for the judicial branch \u2014 what happens if they encounter federal police under orders from the president?\n\nOf course, there is a third branch missing from this hypothetical: Congress. Traditionally, the job of Congress is to keep the president within constitutional bounds. But lawmakers have to be willing to investigate, and possibly even impeach, which is tricky when you\u2019re asking a Republican-led Congress to turn against a Republican president.\n\nFor now, these concerns might seem distant and far-fetched. There\u2019s a big gap between tweeting \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT\u201d and undermining the legitimacy of the American judiciary writ large. So moving forward, the overwhelming likelihood is that if US courts ultimately find Trump\u2019s immigration order unconstitutional, the Trump administration will be disappointed \u2014 but not defiant.\n\nYet, while the risk might be slight, this is one of the classic ways that democracies fail. Political leaders overreach, courts call them to account, and spurned leaders draw on public support to cripple the power of the courts.\n\nIt\u2019s happening even now, with right-populist leaders in Poland and Hungary consolidating power by weakening the independence of the judiciary.\n\nIf you\u2019re confident that it can\u2019t happen here, that\u2019s not because our Constitution is somehow crisis-proof. We are as prone to constitutional standoffs as anyone else. The only reason we\u2019ve been spared is because ever since the Supreme Court first claimed the right to review laws, presidents have played along.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
