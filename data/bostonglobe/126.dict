It will only increase racism in the American society,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe president is trying to make Islamophobia a norm and policy by which he wants to lead the country. There has not been a single terrorist activity from those 7 countries listed above, in the US.\u201d\n\nA member of Sigma Kappa sorority, Rahmati is executive vice president of the MIT Panhellenic Association and volunteers with Camp Kesem, an organization for children whose parents have cancer, according to a Facebook page launched by her supporters, called \u201cBring Niki Back.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

None of these people are threats. They\u2019re students at some of the world\u2019s top universities,\u201d Warren said. \u201cMost of them have already been vetted and granted the right to come to America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order, signed late Friday, puts a temporary moratorium on travel from seven countries while encouraging an effort to tighten the country\u2019s screening of potential terrorists. But confusion has reigned since the weekend, with contradictory messages from the administration about how people with valid green cards would be handled. And even after the travel ban was halted by a one-week stay in the courts on Saturday, some people were still being blocked from returning to the United States, news organizations have reported.\n\nIn speaking of Rahmati in the Senate, Warren said that she was denied travel to the United states a second time on Sunday \u2014 even after a stay had been imposed by the court.\n\nAn MIT spokesman confirmed that Rahmati is a student affected by the travel ban. The university\u2019s president had not previously mentioned her name but had told alumni and members of the school community in a Monday message that he was working to help two undergraduates who were barred from the United States.\n\nMIT\u2019s president, L. Rafael Reif, noted that the university is broadly international, with more than 40 percent of the faculty, 40 percent of graduate students, and 10 percent of undergraduates coming from outside the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order on Friday appeared to me a stunning violation of our deepest American values, the values of a nation of immigrants: fairness, equality, openness, generosity, courage,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cThe Statue of Liberty is the \u201cMother of Exiles\u201d; how can we slam the door on desperate refugees? Religious liberty is a founding American value; how can our government discriminate against people of any religion?\u201d\n\nHe also encouraged people to work \u201cconstructively\u201d to remedy the situation and to acknowledge that \u201cthere are people of goodwill who see the measures in the Executive Order as a reasonable path to make the country safer,\u201d though he added, \u201cI am convinced that the Executive Order will make us less safe.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
