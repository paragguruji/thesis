Quite simply, it\u2019s a solution in search of a problem, and a depressing reminder that more than 15 years after 9/11, Americans still remain in thrall of the practically non-existent threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cTo protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States,\u201d is the argument that Trump uses to justify the order, but in reality, a legal resident or US citizen has launched every jihadist terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11.\n\nThough Trump\u2019s order would ban refugees from Iraq and Syria, not a single refugee from those countries has launched a terrorist attack in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even these facts cloud a more important issue: Americans simply don\u2019t face any significant threat from terrorism.\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

Carbon monoxide poisoning, furniture falling off walls, and lightning strikes each kill less than 100 Americans every year. That\u2019s still higher than the number killed each year by terrorism.\n\nThirty thousand Americans die every year from gun violence; approximately the same number of people are killed in car crashes. Heroin overdoses kill about 13,00 every year. Even unintentional drowning \u2013 in bathtubs, lakes or swimming pools \u2013 kills more than 3,500 people every year, a number approximately 1,800 times larger than the number of people killed by terrorism in the United States in 2015.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more ludicrous about the exaggerated fears of terrorism is that since 9/11, a few, generally small, policy changes have kept Americans safe \u2014 things like locking cockpit doors on planes, improved information-sharing between intelligence agencies, expanded intelligence gathering, and even tighter entry restrictions for people coming into the United States. Moreover, as both the National Counterterrorism Center and the Director of National Intelligence have concluded, there is a far greater terrorist threat to America from home-grown extremists than from those traveling to the United States from overseas. Executive orders like the one Trump is pushing run the very real risk of increasing radicalization here at home and yes, increasing the threat of terrorism.\n\nAP Photo/Kathy Willens A woman holds up a sign at an immigrants\u2019 rights rally on Jan. 29 in New York.\n\nTrump is playing outsized fears of jihadist terrorism to justify a policy that is rooted more in the white nationalism and xenophobia of his aides \u2014 and supporters \u2014 than anything related to national security. While his motives may be pernicious, he\u2019s also pushing against an open door. Fears of terrorism are so ingrained among ordinary Americans \u2014 and particularly Republican voters \u2014 that logic and facts play almost no role in this discussion. Americans associate Muslim countries with terrorism and, as polls indicate, many will embrace even the most racist policy ideas as long as they believe it will make them safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, limiting Muslim immigration to the United States is not some new policy idea. After the terrorist massacre in Paris in the fall of 2015, Republicans practically fell over themselves pushing for a ban on Syrian refugees entering the country. GOP politicians spent much of the 2016 campaign talking about the threat from terrorism in existential terms. Democrats are generally better in talking about this issue, but they too fall into the trap of portraying terrorism as a matter of major national security concern. Both sides get plenty of pressure from a news media that obsessively covers terrorist attacks around the globe and TV talking heads who inflate the potential for similar attacks in the United States. Rare is the politician or commentator who points out, \u201chey, terrorism in the United States isn\u2019t really a big deal.\u201d\n\nAs odious as Trump\u2019s order might be, discriminatory and xenophobic policy ideas that prize \u201csecurity\u201d above all else will continue to be part of the political discourse so long as Americans are told, over and over again, that they should be scared of the next terrorist attack. Stopping the fear is the single best way to stop bad counter terrorism ideas. .\n\nMichael A. Cohen\u2019s column appears regularly in the Globe.
