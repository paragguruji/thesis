Who are the people affected by Trump\u2019s order, and how does it affect them?\n\nRefugees\n\nThey are defined by the United Nations as anyone forced to leave their countries because of persecution, war, or violent conflict. According to the UN, many are afraid to return to their home countries, or can\u2019t. War and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries, but some face persecution because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Trump\u2019s order closed the country to refugees from the seven countries and revoked the previous administration\u2019s promise to accept 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 until the president \u201cdetermine[s] that additional admission would be in the national interest.\u201d\n\nForeign visitors with visas\n\nVisas let foreign nationals enter the United States. But according to the Department of State, visa holders are not guaranteed access to the country. Obtaining a visa means an embassy or consulate has determined an individual is eligible to enter for a particular purpose, such as school or specialized work. The United States offers visas for a variety of reasons, including tourism, education, and employment. Trump\u2019s executive order banned the State Department from issuing visas to people from the seven \u201cCountries of Particular Concern.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile their status to be in the country is legal, they can\u2019t leave the country because they won\u2019t be let back in,\u201d said Gadeir Abbas, an attorney with the Council on American-Islamic Relations who is drafting a lawsuit against Trump\u2019s immigration ban. For example, some academics and people working in research labs at universities in New England have been blocked from reentering the country.\n\nGreen card holders\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.
