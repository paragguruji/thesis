They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nThe official says there\u2019s an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it\u2019s unclear how that exemption will be applied.\n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.\n\nThe official wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump\u2019s order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel.\n\nA statement on the company\u2019s website says: \u2018\u2018Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s JFK airport.\n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n___\n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls\u2019 education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months.\n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria\u2019s civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \u2018\u2018not to turn his back on the world\u2019s most defenseless children and families.\u2019\u2019\n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \u2018\u2018helped build your country.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s mother was born in Scotland\n\nIsrael\u2019s leader has endorsed Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel\u2019s wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants.\n\n\u2018\u2018President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag.\n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair.

He says the U.S. is leading a \u2018\u2018race to the bottom\u2019\u2019 in which politicians in wealth countries provide \u2018\u2018zero moral leadership.\u2019\u2019\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nIran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones.\n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days.\n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \u2018\u2018It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\u2019\u2019\n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \u2018\u2018have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\u2019\u2019\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump\u2019s suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \u2018\u2018harmful and hasty\u2019\u2019 decision.\n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \u2018\u2018America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \u2018\u201812 to 15 government agencies.\u2019\u2019\n\nMiliband praised The United States\u2019 record as a resettlement destination and said, \u2018\u2018This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\u2019\u2019", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "type": "article"}
