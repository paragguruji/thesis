Caught in mid-travel, the assortment of legal visa holders affected by the Muslim travel ban provided a snapshot of the United States\u2019 sophisticated and often productive relationships with the seven singled-out countries.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order blocked graduate students, professors, scientists, mothers and children, a wide departure from cartoonish view the president promotes of Muslim terrorists waltzing through the turnstiles of our international airports. Petulant, and obviously a sore loser, Trump tweeted yesterday that horrible events from \u201cvery many bad and dangerous people\u201d could occur because of the judge\u2019s ruling. It was among most unpresidential things he has said in his brief term, and easily among the silliest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s where we are now: the visa revocations have been reportedly reversed by the State Department and a temporary restraining order issued by a Seattle judge Friday night now apparently guarantees that anyone who had a valid visa or green card to enter the US can do so. The Department of Justice appealed the order but early on Sunday a federal court denied the government request to reinstate Trump\u2019s refugee and travel ban.\n\nThe intensity of the past week served as a civics refresher but also as a preview of what\u2019s surely to come: Trump will continue to challenge the check and balances of power. The good guys won round one, but as this conflict displayed, the power of the presidency is difficult to combat. As the dust settles from the Muslim ban, here are some winners and losers:\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

Xenophobia on the international stage and erratic, amateurish White House leadership are inspiring companies to consider moving jobs abroad for stability\u2019s sake. The US reputation as a destination for the best and the brightest from all over the world risks being corroded by the hostility emanating from Trump.\n\nThe president and his men: Trump has worsened his legal defeat by belittling Judge James Robart, the Seattle jurist who blocked the president\u2019s order, and, of course, appealing the ruling. Most constitutional experts would agree that the president will lose again. \u201cThe outcry and the potential illegality of the measure put the Trump administration in a position where they\u2019re recoiling,\u201d adds Leopold.\n\nImmigrants near and far: Visa holders whose travel was put on hold are now trickling in. But Trump sent a message to every immigrant, whether it\u2019s a family stranded in Damascus or living in Worcester: All bets are off. It\u2019s a new age of fear and uncertainty, whether you have your documents in order or not. \u201cFor Trump, this may have been about a campaign promise, but I\u2019ll tell you what this was not about,\u201d says Segal. \u201cThis was not about national security and this was not about protecting people from terrorism. There were no success stories coming out of these bans \u2014 just heartache.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
