It also is closely monitoring tax overhaul plans that could reduce or eliminate deductions for charitable giving and impose taxes on the university\u2019s huge endowment.\n\nFaust is visiting Washington to make the case directly to members of Congress. It follows a similar trip she made in January, when she met with the Senate leaders from each party, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

Bannon went to Harvard Business School.\n\n\u201cThis administration seems unpredictable in many ways,\u2019\u2019 Faust told editors and reporters at a lunch hosted by Bloomberg News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem tied to the traditional notions of the role of government. And so [the new White House\u2019s] understanding of this long relationship between federal government and higher education is unclear to us.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese same worries are echoed in halls of academia across the Bay State and the country, as university presidents, medical school administrators, and laboratory scientists grapple with the fallout of Trump\u2019s surprising election.\n\nThey view research budgets as especially vulnerable to cuts Trump is mandating to help pay for his planned surge in defense spending. Trump\u2019s pledges to leave Social Security and Medicare alone will magnify pressure on other areas of the budget.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the nature of the budget that Trump is said to be considering, with huge increases in defense spending and no reductions in entitlements, it\u2019s not clear where the kind of support would come from\u2019\u2019 to keep scientific research dollars intact, Faust said.\n\nClimate scientists would be severely impacted by the president\u2019s proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, she added. \u201cThe state of the EPA and the threats to eviscerating its foundations are very much in the minds of our researchers. They are very anxious about where funding came come from,\u2019\u2019 Faust said.\n\nHarvard will continue to advocate for the integrity of rigorous science, she said, while avoiding the ideological fray as an institution. She compared the college\u2019s mission to the media\u2019s efforts to dig out facts.\n\n\u201cWe, too, define our identity in that way. We are about knowledge, facts \u2014 veritas \u2014 truth,\u2019\u2019 said Faust.\n\nFaust telegraphed, in remarks to arts and sciences faculty in December, what she viewed as the need to personally advocate for Harvard in Washington. \u201cI anticipate that this work will consume a considerable portion of my time and attention in the months to come,\u201d she said then.\n\nShe was among several dozen university leaders who wrote to Trump Feb. 2 objecting to his executive order temporarily banning travel to the United States by refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries, calling it unfair, counter to American principles, and chilling on international academic exchange.\n\nThe hastily produced ban has been stayed by federal courts, but Trump is expected to issue a revised ban this week, one designed to better overcome legal challenges.\n\nA Swiss scientist who has worked at Harvard since the 1990s recently told Faust he would rather pursue his work in Switzerland, Faust said Monday, telling her in a letter, \u201cI feel unwelcome here.\u2019\u2019\n\nFaust has established the position of Muslim chaplain to counsel students who are coping with the travel ban fallout. Town hall meetings sponsored by Harvard in response to the ban have attracted 900 people, she said.\n\nShe said she worries about the explicit bans and threats aimed at undocumented students and immigrants, as well as the general environment in the United States for non-citizens. About 20 percent of Harvard students come from foreign countries.\n\nCiting just one example of important international exchanges, she noted long-standing ties between American academic medical centers and Iran, which has been sending medical students to the United States since the days of the shah of Iran.\n\n\u201cIf people from India feel they may be shot if they come to the United States, it is very troubling,\u2019\u2019 said Faust. Last week, an Indian tech worker was shot to death in a Kansas bar.\n\nFaust said she has resisted calls to declare Harvard a \u201csanctuary campus\u2019\u2019 in response to Trump\u2019s plan for more aggressive deportations, however, because she believes it would give students a \u201cfalse sense of security.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe college will require that law enforcement officials get a warrant before entering the campus, and it is offering advice and support. Up to 150 people on campus are undocumented, she estimated.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "type": "article"}
