The new ban took effect immediately for people in countries affected by both versions of the ban.

That suspension is scheduled to expire next month. On that question, too, the court asked the parties to explain whether the issue would soon be moot.\n\nIf the court does eventually dismiss the case as moot, a further legal question will remain. The Trump administration will ask the court to vacate the appeals court decisions striking down the earlier ban, while the challengers will ask that the decisions remain on the books.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest order is likely to start a third round of litigation, which may eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nTwo federal appeals courts found the March ban violated the Constitution or federal immigration law.
