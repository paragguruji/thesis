My office is proud to have supported Hawaii\u2019s lawsuit to protect our state\u2019s residents, economic vitality, and basic values,\u201d Healey said.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

As pioneers for freedom, the ACLU applauds this ruling,\u201d said Rose.\n\nSusan Church, who was among the Boston-based immigration lawyers and advocates who secured a restraining order in Boston days after the first executive order went into effect in January, one of the first issued in the country, welcomed the ruling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe noted that the judge in Hawaii found that the plaintiffs in the state had a \u201clikelihood to succeed,\u201d and that the ruling was based on equal protection grounds, meaning the judge found evidence that the ban discriminates against Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe judge is convinced that, as president trump said on the campaign trail, he was going to institute\u201d a Muslim ban, said Church, chair of the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nIn a ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Derrick Watson said Hawaii would suffer financially if the executive order blocks the flow of students and tourists to the state, and also questioned the government\u2019s argument that the measure was motivated by national security concerns.\n\nThe ruling came as opponents pursued their legal challenges across the country, asking judges in three states to block the executive order that targets people from six predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nMore than half a dozen states are trying to stop the ban. Federal courts in Maryland, Washington state, and Hawaii heard arguments about whether it should be allowed to take effect early Thursday as scheduled.\n\nThe new version of the ban offers more of a national security rationale than the previous one. It is narrower and eases some concerns about violating the due-process rights of travelers.\n\nIt applies only to new visas from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen and temporarily shuts down the US refugee program. It does not apply to travelers who already have visas.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "type": "article"}
