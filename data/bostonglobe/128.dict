Stern, former US attorney for Massachusetts, who hired her to work in that office, remembers her as an independent prosecutor who was never afraid to speak her mind.\n\n\u201cShe went after drug kingpins and against fraudsters,\u201d Stern said, \u201cOr people who were either dangerous or powerful \u2014 it didn\u2019t have an effect on her.

The case fell to Burroughs by chance, as the judge on call for emergencies over the weekend.\n\nIn a rare late-night session, Burroughs and Magistrate Judge Judith Dein imposed a seven-day restraining order, which clears the way for lawful immigrants to enter the United States from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Syria. Burroughs found that Trump\u2019s order violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection and would cause \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d\n\nThe ruling, which goes further than similar ones in New York and Virginia, prevents both the detention or removal of approved refugees and visa or green card holders from the seven affected nations \u2014 a move that has prompted some lawyers to encourage those with green cards to pass through Logan International Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the court rulings, the White House continued to defend the executive order. In a statement released Sunday, Trump said, \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Burroughs\u2019 colleagues learned of her role in the proceedings from the newspaper on Sunday morning and were far from surprised by the strong ruling.\n\n\u201cI had no doubt that she would do what was right, as compared to folding under the executive branch,\u201d said Pucci, a Springfield lawyer. \u201cShe won\u2019t be afraid of making a hard decision, regardless of what party is chasing it.\u201d\n\nThough known for progressive views, colleagues have said that politics don\u2019t get in the way for her. She was nominated to the bench by President Obama in 2014, but Stern said she never operates with an agenda.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a political statement on the part of Allison or New York,\u201d he said.\n\nBurroughs, who declined to comment for this article, apparently found the calling to public service early in her career. After the Massachusetts native graduated from Middlebury College and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s law school, she clerked for the trailblazing Judge Norma L. Shapiro of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1988 to 1989.\n\nAfter her clerkship, Burroughs went to work as a prosecutor in that district, where she made her mark as a member of the organized crime strike force, according to Pucci. The elite team of prosecutors targeted the Mafia \u2014 during that time, taking down notorious Philadelphia don Nicodemo \u201cLittle Nicky\u201d Scarfo and his underlings.\n\n\u2018She is fair, and she has great judgment. Prosecutors have a lot of power, and she was always thoughtful of how that power was being used.\u2019 Alex Whiting, who worked with Judge Allison Burroughs at the US attorney\u2019s office in Boston\n\nBy 1995, Burroughs had transferred to the US attorney\u2019s office in Boston, where Stern said she was a \u201cstar from the beginning.\u201d She took on economic and cyber crimes, according to Jonathan L. Kotlier, a former colleague. She was drawn to the complexities of such cases after studying computer science at Middlebury, he said, an apparent \u201cbackup\u201d vocation if she decided not to practice law.\n\nShe became a partner at Nutter, McClennen & Fish, where she never shied away from controversial cases. She defended Eldo Kim, a Harvard undergraduate who tried to get out of a final exam by sending a bomb threat. She negotiated a deal that allowed Kim to avoid prosecution by completing a diversion program.\n\nIn 2014, Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge, was part of the committee that recommended Burroughs to her current position.\n\n\u201cShe is someone who knows her way around the US attorney\u2019s office, knows her way around the Boston legal community, and more significantly,\u201d she said, \u201cwe knew she would have guts.\u201d\n\nDespite the impressive resume, friends and colleagues praise her for staying down to earth and approachable, while staying open about her experiences raising her twin boys.\n\nAlex Whiting, who worked with Burroughs as a prosecutor at the US attorney\u2019s office in Boston, also said he was always struck by another thing.\n\n\u201cShe is fair, and she has great judgment,\u201d said Whiting, now a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cProsecutors have a lot of power, and she was always thoughtful of how that power was being used.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
