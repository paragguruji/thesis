Earlier this year, U.S. citizen Otto Warmbier was sent home in a coma and later died after spending more than a year in North Korean detention.\n\nOverall, though nearly all Americans who have gone to North Korea have left without incident, at least 16 have been detained in the last decade, American officials say.\n\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning.

The organization, which fights tuberculosis and hepatitis, has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The devil is always in the detail,\u2019\u2019 she said, after landing in Beijing. \u2018\u2018These trips take a long time to plan and organize and so, if travel approval doesn\u2019t come in a timely way, it\u2019s a de facto denial.\u2019\u2019\n\nLinton said the organization appreciated the U.S. government\u2019s concern for its people, but said there was a \u2018\u2018tremendous need\u2019\u2019 for humanitarian work in North Korea.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s very important that there be opportunities for people to understand one another in person,\u2019\u2019 Linton said.\n\nAnother Air Koryo flight from Pyongyang is due to land in Shanghai on Thursday evening.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "type": "article"}
