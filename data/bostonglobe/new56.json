There\u2019s been a string of court rulings against the measure since it was introduced in January and amended in March.\n\nSenator Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trump does \u201chave the right to put in place extreme vetting,\u201d whether the travel ban moves ahead or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe terror threat is real,\u201d Blunt said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that she didn\u2019t agree with Trump that the London attack showed the need for his executive order.\n\n\u201cI think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it\u2019s been rejected by the courts,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe president is right, however, that we need to do a better job of vetting individuals who are coming from war-torn countries into our nation.\u201d\n\n\u2018Slap in the Face\u2019\n\nThe Trump administration has had time to review and implement new vetting procedures instead of continuing to call for a travel ban, U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Intelligence leaders have said such an edict is \u201cin effect a slap in the face to Muslim-Americans and others, and in many ways might actually incite more incidents,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a separate appearance on CNN, Warner said that \u201cin many ways the Muslim-American community is better integrated into our society\u201d than in Europe, which is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d that helps stops attacks like those in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it troubles me so much to see the type of tweets the president has put out in the last 12 hours or so,\u201d Warner said.", "authors": ["Mark Niquette", "Ben Brody", "Bloomberg News"], "publish_date": "2017-06-04", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["warner", "travel", "courts", "trump", "safer", "ban", "intelligence", "rice", "evidence", "vetting", "susan", "need", "london", "president"], "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- There\u2019s no evidence President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, struck down in the courts and awaiting Supreme Court review, would make the U.S. safer from the kinds of attacks carried out in London overnight, his predecessor\u2019s national security adviser said.\nWe need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted.\n\u201cThat is, I believe, one of the major reasons why the courts thus far have been very skeptical of the travel ban,\u2019\u2019 Rice said.\nSenator Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trump does \u201chave the right to put in place extreme vetting,\u201d whether the travel ban moves ahead or not.\n\u201cI think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it\u2019s been rejected by the courts,\u201d Collins said."}
