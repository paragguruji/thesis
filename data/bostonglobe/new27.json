But for opponents of the ban the administration\u2019s interpretation of who had a connection was too narrow.\n\nThe administration said it would let in to the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. (Officials initially wanted to keep out fiances, but later relented.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill banned, though, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees that had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency.\n\nHawaii, which had initially sued over the ban, objected in court, asking Watson to clarify that such people could not be blocked.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Government does not have discretion to ignore the Court\u2019s injunction as it sees fit,\u2019\u2019 lawyers representing the state wrote.\n\nThe government shot back that it was drawing lines on who counted as a close family member based on its interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Justice Department lawyers asserted that the Supreme Court had made clear not all people with U.S. connections should be allowed in.\n\n\u2018\u2018As the Supreme Court instructed, not all relationships with a person in the United States suffice to fall outside the stay and within the injunction,\u2019\u2019 Justice Department lawyers wrote. \u2018\u2018Indeed, not even all familial relationships suffice; rather, a \u2018close familial relationship\u2019 is required.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe matter is likely bound for higher courts. The government had asked Watson to put his own ruling on hold pending \u2018\u2018an immediate request to the Supreme Court for clarification of its ruling,\u2019\u2019 and even those suing agreed that any disputes remaining after Watson\u2019s order \u2018\u2018should be dealt with through expedited appellate review.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the fall on whether Trump\u2019s travel ban can pass legal muster. So far, it has only temporarily blocked lower courts\u2019 injunctions. Some of the justices predicted there might be problems before that.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in an opinion joined by Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that he would have restored Trump\u2019s travel ban in full, in part because he felt the court\u2019s move to restore it only partially would prove \u2018\u2018unworkable\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Today\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u2019\u2019 Thomas wrote. \u2018\u2018The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \u2018bona fide relationship,\u2019 who precisely has a \u2018credible claim\u2019 to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed \u2018simply to avoid\u2019 \u2018\u2018 the executive order, he wrote.\n\nimmig-hawaii", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "The Washington Post"], "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["travel", "relationship", "hawaii", "exempt", "courts", "ban", "supreme", "wrote", "judge", "court", "united", "states", "trumps", "bid", "rejects", "watson", "grandparents"], "summary": "Grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States are not exempt from President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, a federal judge declared Thursday as he denied a bid to curtail enforcement of the executive order meant to keep out citizens of six Muslim majority countries.\nThe administration had wanted to keep such people out, and thought a recent Supreme Court ruling partially lifting lower courts\u2019 freezes on the travel ban allowed them to do so.\nAdvertisementIn his ruling Watson said the state of Hawaii could directly ask the Supreme Court to clarify its ruling.\nHawaii, which had initially sued over the ban, objected in court, asking Watson to clarify that such people could not be blocked.\nJustice Department lawyers asserted that the Supreme Court had made clear not all people with U.S. connections should be allowed in."}
