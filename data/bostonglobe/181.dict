Healey\u2019s office is joining a number of other states\u2019 attorneys general in legal action against the Trump administration regarding the travel ban.\n\nWith Washington, D.C., in turmoil during the opening weeks of the Trump administration, state attorneys general have emerged as the vanguard of resistance to the new presidency.\n\nIn blue states like Massachusetts, where upheaval against President Trump has reached fevered heights, top prosecutors have found constitutional grounds and a political imperative to challenge sweeping changes to federal policy. On immigration, the environment, and women\u2019s rights, a long line has formed to confront Trump in the courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe started this conversation immediately after the election, knowing that we were going to have a lot on our plate,\u201d said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat.\n\nThe events that have unfolded in recent days over Trump\u2019s immigration order demonstrate what can happen when multiple attorneys general pursue the same cause.\n\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning.

She has joined seven other state attorneys general in a case seeking to preserve a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She has joined 16 others in a case defending the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She is leading a coalition defending former president Barack Obama\u2019s decision to terminate an accrediting agency that she says facilitated the abuse of student borrowers by predatory, for-profit schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore recently, Healey joined the local ACLU lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s immigration order suspending travel for citizens of seven banned countries.\n\nAnd on Monday she joined with 16 other attorneys general to file a friend of the court brief to echo their support for the Washington state immigration suit and a similar one in Minnesota.\n\nThe power of an attorney general depends on the law of each state, and some take a more activist role than others. Because Massachusetts laws grant the office some of the broadest powers in the country, the state has often led progressive national suits such as this one.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that President Trump and his administration act in ways that are unconstitutional, it\u2019s going to be up to the state attorneys general, and there\u2019s certainly been a precedent for that over the years,\u201d Healey said.\n\nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose case was victorious Friday, was the first to challenge Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nEric Schneiderman has also filed suit against it in New York, another state that grants its attorney general broad powers. He and Healey coordinate closely.\n\n\u201cThe AGs consider themselves a thin blue line against federal overreach, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d said James Tierney, the former attorney general of Maine who runs a blog about state attorneys general.\n\nThere are 23 Democratic state attorneys general, including the District of Columbia, and 27 Republicans. Alaska\u2019s attorney general is an independent.\n\nAbout 10 Democratic AGs, grouped on the east and west coasts, are known to take a more activist role in suing the federal government, Tierney said. Some others would be more active but Republican Legislatures have curtailed their power and resources.\n\nTierney advises many of the Democrats coordinating their efforts against Trump. The group is braced to file more suits in coming months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually an essential part of federalism in that attorneys general will hold the president\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d Tierney said.\n\nFormer Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger, who in the 1990\u2019s was one of the first attorneys general to sue the tobacco industry for manufacturing a product that caused death and disease when used as instructed, applauded the activism. \u201cThe state attorneys general do offer a significant, independent beacon of hope,\u201d he said.\n\nThese days it is common for state attorneys general to challenge presidential administrations on federal policies, and during Democratic presidencies, the pendulum swings in the other direction among GOP attorneys general.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s tenure, for instance, Republican attorneys generals sued his administration over everything from the Affordable Care Act to his 2014 immigration order, which granted temporary reprieve to undocumented immigrants.\n\nState attorneys general didn\u2019t always view themselves as having this activist role on the national stage.\n\nThat changed in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, when the federal government focused less on issues like civil rights, and environmental and consumer protections, said Harshbarger, who served as Massachusetts attorney general from 1991 to 1999.\n\n\u201cBecause the federal justice department stepped back and/or focused on other things, the state attorneys general became the proactive force,\u201d Harshbarger said.\n\nHarshbarger was a disciple of Frank Bellotti, the Massachusetts attorney general credited with transforming the office from a group of part-time lawyers who represented state agencies into an aggressive machine that looked out for citizens\u2019 interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a much more activist office now than it was when I took office in 1974,\u201d Bellotti said.\n\nHis efforts began with a case against the federal government for taxing imported crude oil. They lost in the Supreme Court, but as a result Congress passed laws that rolled back the tax.\n\n\u201cI just felt it was such a powerful office and you didn\u2019t have that many resources,\u201d Bellotti said, so he focused on issues that had the greatest impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\nAt the same time, many national corporations and others who want to protect against state lawsuits have tried to preempt such attacks by getting federal approval for whatever they are doing.\n\nThat came into play in Massachusetts in 2014 when Governor Deval Patrick announced he would ban Zohydro, a powerful and highly addictive painkiller. In court, an irritated judge sided with the makers of Zohydro, saying that because the federal Food and Drug Administration had already approved the drug a state could not ban it.\n\n\u201cI think, frankly, the governor is out of line on this,\u201d US District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel said from the bench during a hearing on the matter.\n\nState-level politicians, though, appear eager to test the bonds of federalism in the Trump era.\n\nHealey, who reiterated Wednesday that she plans to run for a second term rather than seek the governorship, said, \u201cI\u2019d expect that you\u2019ll continue to see the state attorneys general on the front line.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
