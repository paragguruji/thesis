Which is to say, almost any presidency other than that of Donald J. Trump.\n\nIn the aftermath of the weekend terror attack in London, Trump repeatedly attacked that city\u2019s mayor on Twitter, while criticizing his own Department of Justice and undercutting DOJ\u2019s legal rationale for his troubled travel ban on residents of six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIn his Twitter-targeting of London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim, Trump misrepresented Khan\u2019s comment that Londoners shouldn\u2019t be alarmed by the increased police presence on the streets as a result of the attack, making it sound as though Khan meant Londoners shouldn\u2019t be alarmed by the attack itself. Then, after a mayoral spokesman accurately noted that Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cdeliberately takes out of context\u201d Khan\u2019s comment, Trump re-tworted that that response was a \u201cpathetic excuse by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who had to think fast on his \u2018no reason to be alarmed\u2019 statement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that conduct was unbecoming in an American president, Trump\u2019s tweets about his court-stayed travel policy were astonishing. He confirmed what critics have said all along: It\u2019s meant to be a ban on Muslims. He at first tweeted: \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN.\u201d He then followed up this way: \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\u201d\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

As it is, lower courts have blocked two versions of the policy. Last week, an appeals court upheld the stay of Trump\u2019s revised executive order, saying that order \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d Among other things, the courts have cited Trump\u2019s campaign call for a ban on Muslims, saying that lends weight to the claim that effectuating such a ban is the administration\u2019s true goal. DOJ, however, argues that campaign-trail talk doesn\u2019t deserve that much legal weight.\n\nSo it\u2019s significant that President Trump has now conceded his order is a ban. The fact that his acknowledgment came via Twitter shouldn\u2019t matter. It is, after all, a statement from the president, one that speaks directly to the issue at hand. Further, even if the Supreme Court were to accept DOJ\u2019s argument \u2014 that is, that a 90-day pause on travelers from those six countries is needed while the administration evaluates the current entry rules and makes changes \u2014 it has now been more than three months.\n\nOne interesting question is why Trump dropped the pretense about the ban. Is this merely a case of a president who can\u2019t keep his story straight? Did Trump decide he wanted to strike a resonant chord with his base, legal consequences be damned? Or has he made a more complex calculation that tweeting now will let him say \u201cI told you so\u201d if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t reinstate his order and a terrorist attack somehow involving one of those Muslim nations then occurs in the United States? The profound cynicism shown by this administration about governing makes nearly anything possible.\n\nWe may never know. All we do know is that Trump has seldom looked less like a serious, competent, high-minded president than he did on Monday. And that\u2019s sad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "shouldnt", "court", "twitter", "donald", "trumps", "snit", "order", "president", "attack"], "summary": "Which is to say, almost any presidency other than that of Donald J.
