Sign up here.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s coming up today.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like outside? Today\u2019s the start of a big warmup this week \u2014 around 40 and heading up. But there\u2019s still a tweetstorm in DC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you were sleeping: In the category of real news that matters, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles \u2014 all of which are banned by international agreement. They traveled an average of 620 miles and fell into the Sea of Japan between North Korea and Japan in or near Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. South Korea believes they were ICBMs capable of reaching the US \u2014 Alaska or Washington state (the \u201cIC\u201d stands for \u201cintercontinental\u201d). They certainly could hit Japan. The US, South Korea, and Japan condemned the launch . . . Two people were killed in a fire in Milton overnight, while the town of Warwick in northern Franklin County continues to mourn the loss of a mother and four of her children in a fire over the weekend.\n\nHey, sport: The Celtics play the third of a five-game West Coast series tonight, facing Doc Rivers and the Clippers in LA (10:30 p.m., CSNHD, TNT, and 100.7 FM). Last night they lost a heartbreaker to a terrible Phoenix team when guard Isaiah Thomas lost the ball near the Suns\u2019 basket with two seconds left and Tyler Ulis sank a 3-pointer as time expired. They are 1-1 on the road trip.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

A guy in a toga not ferocious enough?\n\nThe Sox play the Astros in a spring training game at 1:05 p.m.\n\nToday in Trumpville: Oh, where to begin. First, it\u2019s a bit disconcerting that the president doesn\u2019t know that the president can\u2019t order the wiretapping of a US citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, has a sitting president ever accused his predecessor of breaking the law? I know things got nasty between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, but their disagreements were about policy.\n\nThird, Trump should be careful what he wishes for.\n\nIf there was surveillance being done in Trump Tower, it could only have been conducted if intelligence officials had convinced a federal judge in a special court (FISA) that there was a strong likelihood of criminal activity or that someone was acting as the agent of a foreign government. (In other words, a dirty rat fink.) Alarm bells did go off among our spies when they detected unusual activity between a Trump Organization computer server and two Russian banks, but whether Justice officials got a warrant to intercept electronic records from the banks is not known.\n\nAt any rate, sources tell news orgs that FBI Director James Comey says Obama did not order Trump\u2019s phones tapped, as plausible as that is to those who occupy The Long Earth with First Person Singular. In fact, he reportedly has asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trump\u2019s claim. James Clapper, director of national intelligence under Obama, said there was no wiretapping of Trump or his campaign.\n\nMan, the Jeff Sessions stuff seems ages ago, doesn\u2019t it? He\u2019s getting a do-over today, submitting an amended version of his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee to include the fact that he met with the Russian ambassador twice while he was a US senator and an official with the Trump campaign. He\u2019ll answer committee members\u2019 questions in writing, not in person, because that last time was so nerve-wracking.\n\nTrump is supposed to sign that new travel ban today, and he may do it at the offices of Homeland Security, which is a bit awkward: A DHS report found that travelers from the six countries targeted (Trump is dropping Iraq from the list) don\u2019t pose an unusual threat, and that one\u2019s country of origin is not a predictor of future terrorism. The new ban also halts the admission of all refugees (and doesn\u2019t single out Syria), and exempts green card holders (who are permanent residents) and those with valid visas as of when the order is signed.\n\nAnd House Republicans are promising to release their Obamacare replacement bill early this week, but some conservative groups are unhappy that it will provide tax credits to help people pay for their health insurance and they don\u2019t like that it keeps the Medicaid expansion provision, which most GOP governors are demanding stay.\n\nInteresting case before the SJC today: Steven James was 17 when he killed Edward Sullivan by bashing in his head with a baseball bat during a street fight in Rockland in 1994. He confessed, was found guilty of first-degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. (Here\u2019s a terrific review of the case by the Globe\u2019s Bella English from 2014.)\n\nThen, in 2013, the state\u2019s highest court ruled that life sentences for juveniles was unconstitutional; the justices said scientific research shows it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment because their brains are not fully developed. And their decision was retroactive. At the time, there were 63 inmates in Massachusetts who were given life as juveniles; James is one of them, and today he gets a hearing before the SJC.\n\nDoes more booze equal economic development? That\u2019s what Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is banking on in his proposal to award 152 new liquor licenses over three years, many of which would be set aside for neighborhoods that want to attract nightlife.\n\nThere\u2019s a big shindig at Boston Medical Center at 11:30 this morning as hospital, state, and city officials celebrate a $25 million gift from a South Shore billionaire (yes, we have them, too) that will be used to set up a center to fight drug addiction and the opioid epidemic.\n\nIf you\u2019re into bracket games as the NCAA men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tourneys are about to start up, you might enjoy a more intellectual challenge: STAT is running a bracket contest to determine the best innovation in science and medicine.\n\nFinally, for those of you who said you were giving up watching the news because it was too depressing, watch Mia the beagle instead. Enthusiastic, but easily distracted. Like the media.\n\nThanks for reading. I feel like someone is watching me.
