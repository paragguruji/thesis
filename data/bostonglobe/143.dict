When the Bush administration began using that attack a year later to justify invading Iraq, Retik was furious, feeling that the lives of Dave and all the other victims were being misappropriated.\n\nNow, barely 10 days into the Trump presidency, the Needham resident never imagined she would miss President George W. Bush so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would do anything to have him back in the White House, because I wouldn\u2019t be worried that someone is accidentally going to tweet the beginning of World War III,\u201d said Retik, now 48.\n\nOf all that has upset Retik so far \u2014 and the list is long \u2014 she has been most angry over Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee admission and banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Top White House aides have repeatedly cited the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing as justification, making the subject fraught and personal for area residents who lost loved ones or were wounded in those attacks, though their feelings about it range.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Just as survivors of the Boston Marathon attack were divided over whether convicted bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should receive the death penalty, they disagree over the president\u2019s immigration order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiz Norden, the Stoneham mother whose two adult sons each lost legs in the bombing, expressed cautious support for the order. In a country comprised largely of immigrants and their descendants, she appreciates that \u201cpeople come to our country for a better life; I get that, and they should be welcome.\u201d\n\nBut the anguish of what she and her family experienced has made her warier. She said it is hard to know what the screening process is like from afar, but she prefers a better-safe-than-sorry approach, approving of a temporary ban.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a bad person here, but when your family is attacked, your whole aspect changes,\u201d said Norden, who still receives withering messages from strangers on Facebook for endorsing the death penalty for Tsarnaev. \u201cI\u2019m watching out for my family and hopefully my grandchildren, and other people\u2019s, too.\u201d\n\nMarc Fucarile, the Norden family friend who lost a leg in the bombing and has endured dozens of surgeries, told Fox 25 during the weekend that his heart also goes out to suffering refugees. But he said it is better to exclude people than to inadvertently admit potential terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s job is to protect the people of the United States of America, and I feel that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the 38-year-old Fucarile said, crediting Trump for vigilance against the threat of a \u201cTrojan Horse.\u201d\n\nFucarile, who was not available Monday, told WFXT that \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d needs to be confronted. \u201cThey don\u2019t like our ways, they don\u2019t agree with us, and they think it\u2019s OK to kill us. I think people need to wake up and realize, terrorism is a real thing.\u201d\n\nBut Christie Coombs, whose husband Jeff was killed on the same flight as Dave Retik, said the need for vigilance should never justify blanket bans.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that it is not the religion of Islam who is against America, but it is the select population of radicals,\u201d said Coombs, who sat down with her three children in Abington in 2001 and explained \u201cthat they should not hold all Muslims responsible for killing their dad,\u201d a message she has repeated over the years during school visits through the Jeffrey Coombs Memorial Foundation.\n\n\u201cThat we are turning away people based on their faith and nationality who have a right to travel here with proper documentation is abhorrent,\u201d Coombs added, by e-mail. An Arizona native, she is equally dismayed by Trump\u2019s border-wall executive order. She wishes instead that the federal government would concentrate on gun control, to address what she sees as a far more dangerous threat than the ones preoccupying Trump. \u201cPrejudice and walls,\u201d she wrote, \u201care not what make America great.\u201d\n\nRetik is mystified by the list of countries Trump named in the ban, which does not include the four (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates) that produced the Sept. 11 hijackers, not that she would ban travelers from any country or religion. \u201cIt\u2019s all just so upsetting,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are some scary, scary times with him in power.\n\n\u201cI think most people believe \u2014 and I hope I\u2019m not wrong in this \u2014 that most people in this world are good, most people are just trying to get by, and it doesn\u2019t matter what country you were born in, what religion you practice, what race you are, male or female, we all want the same things, for our kids to be educated, to feel safe and secure. That\u2019s just what these people are trying to do. They\u2019re not trying to bomb us.\u201d\n\nPeg Ogonowski Hatch, whose husband, John Ogonowski, was captain of the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11, said she prefers to avoid the political fray. After Trump\u2019s election, she checked out of Facebook, after reading too many posts by people likening their shock and dismay to the way they felt after Sept. 11, knowing there is no comparison between an election result and the murder of a loved one.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the longtime Dracut resident endorses Trump\u2019s order. Of all the things she had read since Friday, a Tweet by the Sudbury-bred actor Chris Evans resonated with her the most. \u201cObviously we must prioritize keeping Americans safe,\u201d she said, quoting Evans. \u201cBut we mustn\u2019t become un-American in the process.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
