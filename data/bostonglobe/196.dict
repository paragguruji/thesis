But federal judges blocked the first set of restrictions, prompting Trump to roll out a revised set of rules, which has also been blocked by judges, so far.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The rate was virtually identical in the 70 days before the inauguration, when 2,571 Syrian refugees entered the US.\n\nStill, under both the current and previous administrations, the United States has opened its doors to only a small number of Syrian refugees compared to those from other countries.\n\nSince 2011, when the conflict in Syria began, a total of 20,470 Syrian refugees \u2014 the vast majority have been children and women \u2014 had come to the United States as of Thursday.\n\nAnd more than three-quarters of that total came just last year, after President Obama ordered the United States to start accepting more from that nation.\n\nObama\u2019s goal was to settle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in a one-year span. Even that pace, while a marked increase for the US, pales in comparison to how other countries have taken in Syrian refugees.\n\nSince the Syrian conflict began: Turkey has taken in almost 3 million; Lebanon, more than 1 million; Jordan, more than 650,000; Germany, more than 450,000; Iraq, more than 235,000; Egypt, more than 120,000; Sweden, nearly 110,000; and Hungary, more than 75,000, according to figures tracked by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nOverall, the UN estimates there are about 13.5 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian aid.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-07", "type": "article"}
