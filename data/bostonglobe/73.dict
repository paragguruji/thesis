Trump has appealed to the regional federal appeals court, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is based in San Francisco. The state of Minnesota later joined Washington\u2019s lawsuit. Oral arguments in the appeal are slated to be made in a hearing Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe filing of an amicus curiae brief, or a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief by the 16 attorneys general allows them to make arguments as interested parties, even if they are not plaintiffs in the case.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The state of Hawaii, which initially sought to join the case as a plaintiff, was later allowed to file its own amicus brief.\n\nHealey said in a statement Monday that, \u201cno president or administration is more powerful than our laws and our Constitution. As state [attorneys general], it is our job to hold this administration accountable and stand for the interests of our states and our residents. We are united in this effort.\u201d\n\nBesides Massachusetts, the other states are New York; Pennsylvania; California; Connecticut; Delaware; Illinois; Iowa; Maryland; Maine; New Mexico; Oregon; Rhode Island; Vermont; Virginia, and the District of Columbia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealey joined a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts in federal court in Boston filed last week on behalf of immigrants affected by the ban and an international aid organization, Oxfam, which said the ban would affect its employees and associates.\n\nUS District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton refused to extend a restraining order that was filed in that case, saying Trump was likely to prevail in court. Almost simultaneously, however, US District Judge James Robart in Seattle agreed to issue a nationwide restraining order halting Trump\u2019s order, siding with the state of Washington\u2019s separate claim that the state would be adversely affected.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
