The president has the power . . . to suspend the entry of aliens when it\u2019s in the national interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nMiller said on CBS News that the judiciary is acting like \u2018\u2018a supreme branch of government.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country,\u2019\u2019 Miller told anchor John Dickerson.\n\n\u2018\u2018I mean, this is just crazy, John. The idea that you\u2019re going to have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u2019\u2019 Miller said.\n\nMiller also suggested that the legal debate is not about the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s action, but rather about ideology.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is no constitutional right for a citizen in a foreign country, who has no status in America, to demand entry into our country,\u2019\u2019 the adviser said on ABC.\n\n\u2018\u2018Such a right cannot exist. Such a right will never exist,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis is an ideological disagreement between those who believe we should have borders and should have controls and those who believe there should be no borders and no controls.\u2019\u2019\n\nMiller\u2019s exchanges with the Sunday show hosts were testy on other subjects as well.\n\nHe punted when ABC anchor George Stephanopolous asked him about The Washington Post\u2019s report that retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn discussed the then-Obama administration\u2019s sanctions against Russia in conversations with that country\u2019s ambassador before Flynn was sworn in as White House national security adviser.\n\n\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have any news to make you today on this point,\u2019\u2019 Miller said, prompting Stephanopoulos to ask, \u2018\u2018Then why are you coming in if you can\u2019t answer the questions being posed about the White House?\u2019\u2019\n\nOn NBC, when anchor Chuck Todd asked Miller whether Trump still had confidence in Flynn, Miller said he did not know, adding that his White House colleagues \u2018\u2018did not give me anything to say.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not for me to tell you what\u2019s in the president\u2019s mind,\u2019\u2019 he told Todd. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s a question for the president.\u2019\u2019\n\nMiller also repeated the false claim that Trump underperformed in the general election because of \u2018\u2018massive voter fraud.\u2019\u2019 Miller provided no evidence to support his assertions in his ABC appearance \u2014 something Stephanopolous pointed out to viewers.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
