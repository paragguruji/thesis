Dorantes, a Mexican immigrant, made an appointment at a naturalization workshop to start the process of becoming an American citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018I wanted to do it for a long time, but I was always busy,\u2019\u2019 said the 33-year-old Dorantes, who came to the United States a decade ago after his father sponsored him for a green card. \u2018\u2018Now, I see what is happening \u2014 everything is crazy.\u2019\u2019\n\nSince last month, immigrants have been rushing to prepare applications to become US citizens. The wait time has doubled for a spot at a monthly naturalization clinic focused on Asian immigrants in Los Angeles. Since Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration, the number of immigrants inquiring about citizenship has also doubled at a Muslim organization in Southern California and at Latin American-focused groups in Maryland and New York, advocates said.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Nearly 1 million people applied to naturalize during the 2016 fiscal year, the largest number in nine years, government data show.\n\nAt naturalization ceremonies in Los Angeles last week, many of the 6,000 new citizens proudly waved flags and shed tears at the culmination of a lengthy journey to become Americans. A ceremony in Chicago a week earlier took an emotional turn when a Syrian immigrant recited the Pledge of Allegiance amid a rancorous court fight over the new president\u2019s travel ban affecting his native country.\n\nImmigrants historically have sought citizenship for the many new opportunities it brings: the ability to vote, better job prospects, an American passport for travel, bringing relatives here from overseas. This year, it\u2019s more about fear in a Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018After the election, the desire to naturalize shifted. It wasn\u2019t more about opportunity and bringing more family, it was more about, \u2018there is a new president who is anti-immigrant and we need to do what we can to protect ourselves,\u2019\u2019 said Nasim Khansari, citizenship project director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Los Angeles.\n\nFor years, immigrant advocates have urged lawful permanent residents, also known as green card holders, to naturalize, which would protect them from deportation were they ever convicted of a crime.\n\nStill, millions of eligible immigrants refrain from doing so, citing fear of passing English language and citizenship tests and exorbitant filing fees.\n\nMost immigrants need to live in the country and have a green card for at least five years before they can file a citizenship application. More than 8 million people were eligible to naturalize in 2013, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAt last week\u2019s ceremonies in Los Angeles, new citizens \u2014 many of whom began the application process long before Trump was elected \u2014 said they were relieved they will not have to deal with stepped-up enforcement measures.\n\n\u2018\u2018At the end of the day, I was still a citizen from Iran. Now, I kind of feel safer,\u2019\u2019 21-year-old Erik Danialian said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-21", "type": "article"}
