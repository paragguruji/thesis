US District Judge James Robart in Seattle granted a restraining order to halt the presidential directive, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld the decision.\n\nRather than continue the court fight, the president decided to craft a revised order that, the White House hopes, will pass legal muster with the courts.\n\nBut Washington state\u2019s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, said Thursday that he will ask Robart to rule that the original restraining order applies to the new travel ban, as well \u2014 a move that, if successful, would block the second order from being put into effect, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerguson told reporters that the attorneys general in Oregon and New York had asked to join his state\u2019s legal action, along with Minnesota, which is already party to the suit.\n\nThe attorney general of Hawaii filed a separate suit on behalf of that state on Wednesday.\n\nRachel Rosenbloom, a Northeastern University law professor who specializes in immigration policy, said it makes sense for attorneys general to concentrate their efforts on the lawsuit in Seattle, because the restraining order Robart issued applied nationwide.\n\nShe added that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing unusual with states joining together to challenge a federal policy,\u201d noting several states joined a Texas lawsuit to challenge then-President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nMassachusetts Governor Charlie Baker did not directly endorse Healey\u2019s decision to join the other states in trying to block the new order. But Lizzy Guyton, his communications director, said in a statement that the governor opposes the president\u2019s travel bans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGovernor Baker is proud that Massachusetts is a global community that benefits economically and academically from our diverse population and the administration will continue to communicate concerns regarding the disruptive orders,\u201d Guyton said.\n\n\u201cThe Baker-Polito administration does not believe these orders make our nation any safer and will review the legal proceedings carefully.\u201d\n\nThe states argue the travel ban infringes on their sovereign rights by banning people who could work at or attend state institutions, such as universities and hospitals. The states would lose possible benefits, such as tax revenue and tourism.\n\nThe states also argue that they have a role to defend the immigrants and affected institutions.\n\nIn its suit, Hawaii said the revised order would harm its Muslim population, tourism, and foreign students.\n\nTrump has maintained that he has broad authority over the country\u2019s immigration system to ensure national security. He has said that the travel ban does not discriminate against Muslims and that the included countries pose security risks.\n\nHealey\u2019s announcement that she would join the Washington state lawsuit came soon after her office withdrew its claim in a similar lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in Boston that challenged Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 order.\n\nAaron Wolfson, a spokesman for the ACLU in Massachusetts, said his office was still deciding how to proceed in the Boston case, adding: \u201cWe remain committed to working with our ACLU colleagues nationwide to challenge the new Muslim ban and any actions we believe to be illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe Boston lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Iranian nationals who have lived here as lawful permanent residents for more than a decade and who teach engineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. They were temporarily detained at Logan Airport upon returning from an engineering conference in France after the ban took effect.\n\nA federal judge issued a restraining order in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, preventing the detention or removal of lawful residents and visa holders.\n\nA week later, US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton refused to extend that restraining order, saying the president has broad authority over immigration policy.\n\nThat same day, however, Robart issued a restraining order in the Washington case in a ruling that applied nationwide, making Gorton\u2019s decision moot.\n\nThe national office of the ACLU also said Thursday that it will challenge the revised order on the grounds it discriminates against people based on nationality and religion, in violation of the First Amendment and equal protection laws.\n\n\u201cThe president made clear that he wanted a Muslim ban, and merely tweaking some of the words in the order does not eliminate the taint of discrimination,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer.\n\nGelernt won the first restraining order against the earlier version of Trump\u2019s travel ban in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nHe said his office will file a revised challenge in a lawsuit that was filed in Maryland, after the first ban was enacted. He could not say Thursday when the new challenge will be filed.\n\nIn the decision that put the brakes on the first version of the ban, the appeals court in San Francisco did not address the claim that the order discriminated against Muslims, though it recognized the \u201cserious nature\u201d of the allegations.\n\nRosenbloom, the Northeastern professor, said Trump\u2019s legal team crafted new language and provided for exemptions in the new ban in an effort to protect it from new legal challenges. For example, the revised order says current visa holders and lawful permanent residents won\u2019t be affected, and it removes language that would give priority to religious minorities.\n\nThe states\u2019 challenge will be more complex, Rosenbloom said, but she still believes they have a claim.\n\n\u201cIt is still a Muslim ban, and I do think there are good grounds to challenge it,\u201d she said.\n\nFerguson, the Washington attorney general, said Thursday that it\u2019s not the executive branch, but the court, that gets to decide whether the revised order is different enough that it should not be covered by the previous restraining order.\n\n\u2018\u2018It cannot be a game of whack-a-mole for the court,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018That [temporary restraining order] we\u2019ve already obtained remains in effect.\u2019\u2019\n\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.
