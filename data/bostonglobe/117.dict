Nonetheless, Democrats and some interest groups say they will challenge the order all the same.\n\nThere were numerous ways in which this order was different:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n-- The mere presentation of the executive order was different. Instead of President Trump issuing a surprise order himself in front of reporters on a Friday afternoon, he signed it in private without any press inside of the Oval Office on a Monday morning.\n\n-- Instead of catching his own cabinet members and members of Congress off guard, three members of his cabinet held a scheduled press conference defending and explaining what the order would do. The appearance of Trump\u2019s secretaries of state and homeland security along with his attorney general took place after an hour-long background call with reporters. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he had spent hours talking to members of Congress ahead of the press conference.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

When his first executive order was announced, Jeff Sessions had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, and a holdover from the Obama administration was the acting attorney general. She dismissed the order, and then she, too, was dismissed.\n\n-- In terms of substance, the second order appeared to be more thought-out to avoid some sticky and confusing situations. The first executive order banned green card holders from returning to the United States; the second one allows it. The first executive order banned those coming from Iraq, which meant that even those who aided American troops were barred from entry; the second one removes Iraq from the list of countries banned. The first executive order had a religious test that gave preference to Christians; the second one does not.\n\n-- This executive order will also be implemented differently. The first executive order was to be implemented immediately, which created confusion among homeland security officials. This order will become in ten days, on March 16. This, in theory, will provide more time to clear up rules and instructions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitically, Trump is not admitting any mistakes with the first executive order and Democrats have already said they feel the same way about the second travel ban as they did about the first. Legally, the ACLU has already said they will challenge this order in court.\n\nBut unlike last time, no one was caught off guard.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
