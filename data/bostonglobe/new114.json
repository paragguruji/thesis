O\u2019Malley, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston, sent a letter to parishes underscoring the church\u2019s support for immigrants and refugees, calling upon all Catholics to heed Pope Francis\u2019s warnings against \u201cthe globalization of indifference.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the critical role immigrants have played historically and continue to play in the American Catholic Church, and the worldwide church\u2019s commitment to standing with newcomers and those fleeing violence and hardship in their homelands.\n\n\u201cJust as we are a country of immigrants, so too we are a church of immigrants,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter, which the archdiocese said was read aloud to parishioners at churches throughout the archdiocese this past weekend, was among a series of actions O\u2019Malley has taken to speak up for immigrants following two executive orders from President Trump last month clamping down on refugee resettlement and immigration.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The same day, he published an opinion essay in the Globe lamenting the \u201ctone, style, and frenzied pace\u201d of the orders. O\u2019Malley said the orders produced \u201castonishment and confusion\u201d here and abroad.\n\nIn the letter to parishioners, the cardinal cited his own experience working with undocumented immigrants from the early days of his priesthood, when he spent years in Washington, D.C., serving people fleeing violence in Central America. He said he has \u201cseen up close the pain and suffering visited upon families who are forced by circumstances to live in the shadows, always fearful of discovery and economic ruin.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley said he understood the need for immigration reform, but said he thought most Americans saw immigration as a crucial building block of American society.\n\n\u201cAlthough many Americans are frustrated by a broken immigration system and others are fearful of the threat of terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote, \u201cI believe that most people in this country recognize that we are a nation of immigrants and that we have an established history of assimilating people of different languages, religions, ethnicities into the magnificent mosaic that is America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted that immigrants contribute to the economy and government by paying taxes \u2014 \u201c$1.36 billion in [Massachusetts] state income taxes and $1.28 billion in local property taxes\u201d \u2014 and by doing, often, \u201cthe hardest work for the least pay.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley sought to reassure Catholic immigrants, \u201cespecially families in the most precarious situations,\u201d that the church stands with them and would \u201cwork hard to promote solutions to the challenges that you face.\u201d\n\nHe added that Pope Francis\u2019s first journey as pope was to call attention to the plight of refugees on the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n\n\u201cKnow that you are constantly in our thoughts and prayers,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote. \u201cYou are not alone. You are an important part of our family, and your church will not cease to advocate on your behalf.\u201d\n\nLisa Wangsness can be reached at lisa.wangsness@globe.com", "authors": ["Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["pope", "trump", "wake", "immigrants", "ban", "taxes", "orders", "immigration", "catholic", "support", "cardinal", "expresses", "omalley", "church", "letter"], "summary": "\u201cJust as we are a country of immigrants, so too we are a church of immigrants,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\nThe same day, he published an opinion essay in the Globe lamenting the \u201ctone, style, and frenzied pace\u201d of the orders.\nO\u2019Malley said the orders produced \u201castonishment and confusion\u201d here and abroad.\n\u201cKnow that you are constantly in our thoughts and prayers,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote.\nYou are an important part of our family, and your church will not cease to advocate on your behalf.\u201dLisa Wangsness can be reached at lisa.wangsness@globe.com"}
