Some happened. Some didn\u2019t.\n\nBut who got arrested?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal immigration officials won\u2019t say, even though some experts say a little-noticed clause in President Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 executive order appeared to make most immigration arrest and court records public for the first time.\n\n\u201cI see no legal barrier to that [information] being disclosed now,\u201d said Mary Ellen Callahan, a lawyer and the former chief privacy officer for the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThere\u2019s no prohibition about them being public anymore.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Officials say they are protecting immigrants\u2019 privacy.\n\nBut critics say the agencies are also shielding themselves from public scrutiny \u2014 a serious concern because they are jailing immigrants and trying to deport many of them to dangerous lands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, the Globe called on Trump to make all immigration arrests and court records available to the public, just as they are in the criminal system, after the newspaper documented the hazards of federal secrecy. In a campaign speech last year, Trump cited a Globe report that showed immigration officials secretly released thousands of criminals in the United States because they were unable to deport them. Then officials misled Congress about how often the criminals reoffended.\n\nThe Globe has also found that the dangers extend well beyond criminals, to sick immigrants jailed without a hearing, to the dozens who have died in detention, and the thousands held in remote immigration jails far from legal aid and families.\n\nStill, some people are worried about making immigration arrests open to the public \u2014 Callahan among them. Some fear that people might harm immigrants or seek to embarrass them.\n\nCallahan says Trump\u2019s order strips privacy protections from immigrants too broadly. \u201cSection 14 eviscerates it,\u201d she said.\n\nSection 14 is a paragraph in Trump\u2019s executive order that says that the Privacy Act applies only to those covered by the 1974 law: Green card holders and US citizens \u2014 so it wouldn\u2019t quite go as far as the Globe had requested. \u201cAgencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information,\u201d the order says.\n\nThe Trump administration has not confirmed that the clause makes arrest and court records public \u2014 and immigration agencies aren\u2019t rushing to figure it out, in stark contrast to their lightning-quick enforcement of the travel ban that Trump issued two days later. Officials swiftly canceled 60,000 visas and stranded travelers at airports worldwide, unable to board planes to come to the United States.\n\nAsked if immigration court records are now public, spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said on Jan. 27 that officials were evaluating Trump\u2019s executive orders \u201cto implement them as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think they have any legal foundation for their withholding of information.\u2019 Jessica Vaughan, Center of Immigration Studies director of policy studies\n\nNothing had changed two weeks later, she said.\n\nBryan Cox/Immigration and Customs Enforcement/AP Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Atlanta raided a home earlier this month.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Shawn Neudauer said the Homeland Security agency is also \u201ccurrently determining how to best implement policies and guidance to carry out the executive order.\u201d\n\nCustoms and Border Protection hasn\u2019t yet released the names of any detainees, either. A spokesman said they were \u201cawaiting a modified privacy policy.\u201d\n\nEven people who favor stricter immigration enforcement say they hope Trump\u2019s executive order will increase transparency.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have any legal foundation for their withholding of information,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center of Immigration Studies. \u201cThe agencies are clearly being directed to release more information on people who are subject to immigration enforcement.\u201d\n\nOthers say they hope the transparency, if put into effect, will also include protections for asylum seekers and others who fear for their lives.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU of Massachusetts welcomes The Boston Globe\u2019s call for increased transparency in the immigration enforcement system,\u201d said executive director Carol Rose. \u201cWhile protections must exist for the privacy of asylum seekers and other vulnerable individuals, a presumption of openness is consistent with the Constitution, the common law, and the interests of democracy.\u201d\n\nFederal officials\u2019 refusal to provide information has frustrated people on all sides of the immigration debate.\n\nFor instance, when President Barack Obama severely limited ICE\u2019s power to deport immigrants in 2014, nobody knew that the policy protected Renato Cordeiro-DeCampos, who returned to the United States after being deported in 2007, a federal crime. He was later arrested for alleged crimes in Massachusetts, some minor. ICE officials said they didn\u2019t detain him because he wasn\u2019t a priority under Obama\u2019s rules.\n\nHe is now: This month police arrested him for allegedly sexually assaulting two 13-year-old girls on Cape Cod. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nAlthough Trump has pledged to fully enforce immigration laws, his administration is facing questions about civil rights violations out of public view.\n\nThe ACLU has been trying to get the names of immigrants detained and deported under Trump\u2019s travel ban so that they can represent them in a class-action lawsuit in Eastern New York.\n\nA judge ordered the government to provide the names to the civil-liberties organization, but it hasn\u2019t yet.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has said he is intensifying immigration enforcement, but according to ICE, as of Feb. 4, some 41,068 immigrants were detained, a slightly lower number than the month before Obama left office (41,533).\n\nRaids last week led to the arrests of 680 more immigrants nationwide, and officials said that most of the immigrants were criminals. But without additional information, that is impossible to verify.\n\nOfficials said nobody was arrested in Massachusetts as part of the raids. But lawyers say that is not the full story.\n\nCarlos Estrada, a Boston immigration lawyer, said two clients were arrested in early February in a predawn raid at a house in Dorchester. He said they have no criminal records, but were in the house when ICE arrived looking for someone else.\n\nAnother immigration lawyer, Talia Barrales, said she thought immigration records should be public so that the American people will know how Trump is really enforcing the laws.\n\nBut she warned that the troubles with the immigration system started earlier. She has a client from Latin America who has been detained in Georgia for 1.5 years, before Trump took office, after fleeing domestic violence.\n\nThousands have protested Trump\u2019s policies, but nobody protested that, she said. \u201cWhere have they been?\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-19", "type": "article"}
