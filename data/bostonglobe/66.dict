As of Monday, 10 students have applied for the scholarship, college officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWheaton is a global institution that is dedicated to improving the world by advancing knowledge and sharing it,\u201d Wheaton College President Dennis M. Hanno said in a statement. \u201cThe current executive order on immigration endangers our ability to deliver on that mission.\u201d\n\nCurrently, two out of the 1,650 students at the Norton school hail from one of the seven countries, said spokesman Michael Graca.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Gosselin, vice president and dean of admission and student aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese students have faced hardships unlike anything we could imagine and will need significant assistance to make acquiring an education possible,\u201d Gosselin said. \u201cWe believe it is our responsibility as contributors to global education to make this commitment.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
