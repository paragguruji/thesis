A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nTrump, who started the day off with six tweets, also asserted that \u201cbig problems\u201d at the nation\u2019s airports were not caused by his executive order \u2014 and were caused, at least in part, by \u201cthe tears of Senator Schumer.\u201d\n\nOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nprotesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nA Delta systems outage Sunday night led to departure delays and cancellations of at least 150 Delta flights. However, the chaos started Saturday as protesters packed some of the country\u2019s major airports to demonstrate against the executive order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, became emotional at a press conference Sunday while denouncing the order as \u201cun-American\u201d and vowing to fight it.\n\nTrump also announced in a tweet that he had decided who he would nominate for the open seat on the US Supreme Court. He wrote that he would make that announcement live at 8 p.m Tuesday.\n\nHe concluded with what appeared to be a nod to the uproar caused by the immigration order and a pivot back to his protectionist economic message.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
