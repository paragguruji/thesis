The appeals court ruling keeps the Seattle judge\u2019s restraining order in place until further proceedings can be held.\n\n\u201cYes! Excellent,\u201d said Susan Church, one of the Boston lawyers leading a similar lawsuit in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a great decision,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that we could\u2019ve wanted.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

She was one of 16 state attorneys general from across the country who filed court briefs supporting the Seattle judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cTonight, the Ninth Circuit upheld the principle that no president is more powerful than our Constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cMy office challenged this reckless and discriminatory executive order to protect the residents, economic vitality, and basic values of Massachusetts. I stand with state attorneys general united in our commitment to hold this administration accountable to the laws and the people of this country.\u201d\n\nCarol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, added, \u201cThis is very good news for all the people, the families, the businesses disrupted, all the lives that have been impacted by the recent Trump ban on immigration from majority Muslim nations.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to a police association Wednesday, Trump said \u201cterrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the appeals court said the government did not detail these risks \u2014 and why they would warrant a ban that disrupted hospitals, colleges and businesses nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the court said.\n\nOn Thursday, and the Ninth Circuit decision, Trump tweeted \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nVincent DeVito, who chaired the president\u2019s campaign in Massachusetts, sought to downplay the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe \u2026 decision is not a ruling on the merits. It is merely a temporary continuation of the\u201d restraining order, said DeVito, a lawyer and partner at the law firm Bowditch & Dewey, who said he was speaking for himself and not as a member of the administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLegal minds can greatly differ; so, different justices would have made a different decision,\u201d he added.\n\nThe proceedings in San Francisco were being closely watched in Boston, where immigrants\u2019 rights and civil liberties lawyers were among the first in the nation to file a court challenge to Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nThe Jan. 27 order barred visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from the US for 90 days, halted the entire refugee program for 120 days, and kept out Syrian refugees indefinitely. Though there was initial confusion about the president\u2019s policy and who would be affected, officials later said that the restrictions would not apply to people with green cards.\n\nAdvocates reported hundreds if not thousands of people were stranded at airports worldwide, including at Logan International Airport.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Jan. 29, less than two days after the president announced his executive order, two judges in Boston agreed to issue a temporary restraining order halting the president\u2019s travel ban. The judges\u2019 order prevented US Customs and Border Protection agents from deporting or detaining immigrants who had lawful visas before the president\u2019s ban went into effect, and the judges\u2019 order instructed the federal agents to alert airlines that passengers would be free to enter the country.\n\nThe judges\u2019 order was so broad that immigrants\u2019 rights advocates began telling people with valid visas that they should fly into Logan International Airport, regardless of their final destination in the US, because the temporary restraining order made clear they could not be deported or detained.\n\nBut the victory was short-lived. A week later, on Feb. 3, US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton \u2013 after receiving court briefs and hearing oral arguments \u2013 rejected a request to extend the restraining order. The judge found that the president had a likelihood of success in the case \u2013 one of the key factors in deciding whether to issue a restraining order \u2013 because the president has broad authority over immigration policies that outweigh any constitutional protections that visa-holders may have. The judge also found that immigrants who had not been in the country had no rights to the visas at all.\n\nThe ruling did not address the long-term outcome of the case, and it only meant that the restraining order in Boston would expire.\n\nLess than two hours after Gorton released his ruling, however, US District Judge James L. Robart issued a restraining order in Seattle in a lawsuit brought by the state of Washington, which claimed that the president\u2019s ban had an adverse affect on immigrants who live and work in that state, as well as the state\u2019s tourism industry. Robert found that immigrants could have some claim that the ban was discriminatory, and that they would suffer irreparable harm if the restraining order was not granted \u2013 a separate standard for considering a restraining order.\n\nRobart applied his ruling nationwide, saying the country should have a uniform immigration code. The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit appellate court.\n\nLocal advocates and lawyers cheered Robart\u2019s ruling. Though their victory in Boston had been short-lived, they argued, it started a series of court challenges that forced the government to scale back parts of its order, such as the restrictions on lawful permanent residents. They also argued that the local suit led to further court scrutiny of the travel ban, and eventually, to the Ninth Circuit decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really strongly worded decision,\u201d said Kerry Doyle, a lawyer involved in the Boston case. \u201cIt\u2019s really heartening to see our third branch of the government really stand up for the Constitution and see its role in reining in the extreme overstep by the executive.\u201d\n\nShe said the Ninth circuit supported its ruling with a litany of Supreme Court decisions, a sign that this appeals ruling is national in scope.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision written with an eye toward Supreme Court law,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cTo me it shows that they really made an effort to show the national implications of the ruling.\u201d\n\nChurch said that the appeals court ruling is a significant victory, but noted that the government may appeal. She urged visa-holders to proceed with caution, especially if they want to leave the country.\n\nRose, of the ACLU, noted however that the appeals court was clear in stating that the courts have the right to check the president\u2019s powers, in spite of Trump\u2019s claim that he has final say on immigration matters.\n\n\u201cThis well-reasoned opinion shows that the president is not above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever far presidential executive power extends, it does not extend to violating the Constitution, which the president has been sworn to uphold.\u201d\n\nMarielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, also celebrated the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today acted, as the courts are supposed to, as a necessary check on the blatantly unconstitutional overreach President Trump made in issuing this unlawful and un-American executive order,\u201d she said. \u201cThis decision means, for now, that people seeking refuge from horrific conditions will not be turned away, that families torn apart by this discriminatory policy can reunite, and that America can continue to benefit from the contributions of immigrants who have long fueled the engines of innovation and helped our communities thrive.\u201d\n\nMilton Valencia can be reached at milton.valencia@globe.com .
