Refugees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the devastating civil war in Syria rages on, many Cambridge residents have expressed their desire to welcome some of the country\u2019s 4.8 million refugees into their neighborhoods and homes. But well-meaning residents and local politicians have hit a brick wall \u2014 not President Trump\u2019s travel ban, but the city\u2019s high cost of living and the limited capacity of local government to address an international crisis.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

He won passage of legislation calling on city officials to determine Cambridge\u2019s capacity to take in Syrian refugees and then provide those families with the housing and support they would need.\n\nBut when peace commissioner Brian Corr \u2014 the local official charged with promoting \u201cpeace and social justice within Cambridge and in the wider world\u201d\u2014 began reaching out to refugee resettlement agencies and government officials, he was told, politely, no thanks.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and got a lot of e-mail information. Long story short . . . Cambridge is not the place where refugees get resettled,\u201d Corr said.\n\nWhere refugees end up is largely at the discretion of the State Department and nine resettlement agencies nationwide. From 2014 to 2016, 233 Syrian refugees arrived in Massachusetts. More than half went to Lowell, Springfield, or West Springfield, according to State Department records. None wound up in Cambridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial support is limited for new arrivals. Representatives of the State Department and Massachusetts resettlement agencies said they consider two factors when placing refugees, in addition to family ties.\n\n\u201cThe key factor is a combination of cost of living and employment opportunities that will allow them to become economically self-sufficient quickly because the support that the federal government provides is extremely limited,\u201d said Jeffrey Thielman, president and CEO of the International Institute of New England, the area\u2019s largest resettlement agency.\n\nEach refugee receives a one-time stipend of $2,075 from the federal government, and nearly half of that goes to the resettlement agency to help finance their work, according to a State Department spokeswoman. Agencies sometimes provide refugees additional cash assistance, and some refugees can receive $428 per month from the state for up to 18 months.\n\nSuch small sums don\u2019t go far in Cambridge, where two-bedroom apartments rent for around $3,000 a month. That\u2019s twice as expensive as housing in Springfield or Lowell.\n\nThroughout Greater Boston, inexpensive housing options are few and shrinking. Thielman said the only places in the area where his agencycan find housing for refugees are shared units for single individuals in Lynn or Dorchester \u2014 places where they can pay $350 or less in rent per month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorr reported his findings to the Cambridge Council at a hearing in October 2015, and from his perspective, the city\u2019s hands were tied. But Mazen urged administrators to try to settle just one or two families as a powerful symbol for the community. He said he knew the high cost of living in the city would pose a challenge, but he\u2019s disappointed city officials did not pursue further action.\n\n\u2018\u2019\n\n\u201cThe idea is to do our part by resettling any number of families \u2014 including one family \u2014 to show our commitment to the city, to show it can be done, to show we are paying attention, that we\u2019re having the conversation,\u201d Mazen said.\n\nBut the chances of this have grown increasingly slim since a recent Supreme Court decision allowed part of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect, lowering the ceiling on refugee admissions to 50,000 and effectively barring refugees without family ties from coming to the United States for 120 days.\n\nDespite this, efforts to house refugees continue in Cambridge. Lydia Marik, who lived in Central Square until recently, started an online survey in 2015 to gauge interest among local residents in taking refugees into their homes \u2014 with the idea of eventually petitioning resettlement authorities to send their clients to Cambridge. Over 300 people across the Boston area have signed up since then, indicating a capacity to house 776 refugees.\n\nBut while resettlement agencies rely on donations and volunteers, they don\u2019t endorse this host family approach.\n\n\u201cFor the refugee families, the ideal situation is to be placed in permanent housing the day they arrive,\u201d Thielman said.\n\nAnd with refugees putting down roots elsewhere, Cambridge residents have turned to other ways to help. They organized clothing drives and poster campaigns, and started an advocacy group, \u201cCambridge Support for Syrian Refugees.\u201d At the World Refugee Day event last month, they donated money and supplies to a Boston-area agency.\n\nBut Marik, at least, has not let go of the idea that Cambridge might one day house displaced Syrians. When she heard about a new initiative by Airbnb that allows hosts to offer their spare rooms to refugees for free, she pulled up the 300-person list she had started gathering two years before and sent them a link.\n\n\u201cNow that there\u2019s a hope for [the list] to be more than symbolic, it\u2019s so exciting,\u201d Marik said.\n\nFollow her on Twitter @ClaireParkerDC\n\nClaire Parker can be reached at claire.parker@globe.com", "authors": ["Claire Parker", "Globe Correspondent"], "publish_date": "2017-07-05", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["state", "housing", "cambridge", "refugee", "local", "welcomes", "families", "resettlement", "city", "refugees", "agencies", "resettled"], "summary": "Cambridge is not the place where refugees get resettled,\u201d Corr said.\nWhere refugees end up is largely at the discretion of the State Department and nine resettlement agencies nationwide.\nRepresentatives of the State Department and Massachusetts resettlement agencies said they consider two factors when placing refugees, in addition to family ties.\nAgencies sometimes provide refugees additional cash assistance, and some refugees can receive $428 per month from the state for up to 18 months.\nBut while resettlement agencies rely on donations and volunteers, they don\u2019t endorse this host family approach."}
