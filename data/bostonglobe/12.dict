He said he is pleased the court did not allow all aspects of the order to take effect.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

Markey, a Democrat, said in a statement that he hopes the court strikes down the executive order.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Supreme Court decision reaffirms President Trump\u2019s over-reach by trying to enact a defacto Muslim ban,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cI hope that the Supreme Court will ultimately rule as the lower courts have that this travel ban is unconstitutional and un-American.\u201d\n\nMayor Martin J. Walsh emphasized the city\u2019s commitment to religious tolerance in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cIn Boston, immigrants and their families will always be valued members of our community,\u201d he said. \u201cOur nation is rooted in the freedom to practice one\u2019s faith and we should continue to welcome people, regardless of their religion or country of origin. I look forward to a resolution of the travel ban by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nUS Representative Seth Moulton, a Salem Democrat, said in a statement the ban threatens national security.\n\n\u201cThis Muslim ban is simply unconstitutional, and I\u2019m hopeful that the Supreme Court will strike it down for good,\u201d his statement reads. \u201cNot only does it go against American values, but it also plays right into the hands of our enemies, and puts our troops\u2019 lives and our country\u2019s national security at risk. We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies.\u201d\n\nUS Representative Joe Kennedy III, a Brookline Democrat, said in a Monday statement that the travel ban \u201cwill not keep our people safe, only make our country weak. It should be struck down.\u201d Congressman Michael Capuano, also a Democrat, took issue with the court\u2019s decision to allow part of the order to proceed.\n\n\u201cArbitrarily barring entrance from six countries \u2013 four of which are involved in bloody, brutal civil wars \u2013 is not American in spirit,\u201d Capuano said in a statement. \u201cIf the Supreme Court feels the need to hear full arguments on this unjust Executive Order in the fall, I accept that. However in the meantime, the President\u2019s travel ban should have been stayed completely.\u201d\n\nUntil Monday, two lower court rulings had blocked the ban in its entirety. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit argued that the order was animated by religious discrimination, citing Trump\u2019s campaign statements calling for a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Trump had overstepped presidential authority.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed both decisions to the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in October.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "type": "article"}
