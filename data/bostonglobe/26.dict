Phil Roe, R-Tenn., said.\n\nThe speaker did warn lawmakers to expect protests in their districts and possible backlash.\n\nRep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., said Ryan stressed that the order is similar to legislation Republicans have backed in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re looking at eight years of a legacy that we\u2019re essentially undoing,\u2019\u2019 Ross said.\n\nSaid Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y.: \u2018\u2018The speaker was very out in front today reminding our conference this is something we should be embracing.\u2019\u2019\n\nTop congressional leaders of Trump\u2019s party were left to find out the same way the general public did: from news reports as Trump signed the order.\n\n\u2018\u2018I guess one of you guys probably told me about it. Thank you for that,\u2019\u2019 Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Monday.\n\nThen, as lawmakers struggled to gather details for constituents about the temporary halt to all refugee admissions, as well as a travel and immigration ban for those coming from seven Muslim-majority nations, at least one prominent GOP senator was told that the State Department had been instructed not to communicate with Congress.\n\n\u2018\u2018There\u2019s not a lot of answers as of today. In fact my staff was told the State Department as of today was ordered not to talk to Congress about this issue,\u2019\u2019 said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \u2018\u2018That cannot be a permanent position, we expect answers here fairly soon.\u2019\u2019\n\nNext followed the surprising news, first reported by Politico, that the administration\u2019s repeated claims that Hill Republicans were involved in drafting the executive order apparently referred to staffers on the House Judiciary Committee who acted without the knowledge of GOP leadership.\n\nEach new revelation set off alarm bells on Capitol Hill where Republicans, eager to give Trump the benefit of the doubt barely a week into his presidency, are confronting repeated bouts of chaos of the administration\u2019s own making. The failure to consult with lawmakers ahead of time on the immigration executive order set the stage for high-profile Republicans to criticize the measure once it started attracting widespread controversy \u2014 and so they did, though House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have remained largely supportive.\n\nAnd the administration\u2019s decision to make a major foreign policy move with no notice to Congress raised questions about how well the Trump White House will work with Capitol Hill to push through a massive legislative agenda that includes repealing and replacing Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, overhauling the tax code and building a border wall. Although many Republicans remained optimistic that the failures amounted to growing pains for the new administration, congressional relations under the Trump administration seemed to be off to a sour start.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think they understand, let me put it that way, that this was not handled in the most productive manner,\u2019\u2019 Corker said. \u2018\u2018My guess is next time they attempt to do something that is far-reaching like this there'll be a lot more communication.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s order pauses America\u2019s entire refugee program and indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria. Federal judges in New York and several other states issued orders that temporarily block the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Trump\u2019s travel ban took effect. Trump fired the Justice Department\u2019s acting attorney general Monday after she refused to defend the order in court, replacing her with someone who would.\n\nThroughout the day Monday, as confusion continued at home and abroad over the scope and implementation of the order, White House officials led by press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Hill Republicans were involved in drafting the order and were aware of it beforehand. Yet top aides to House GOP leaders repeatedly disputed that assertion, leaving it unclear what Spicer was talking about.\n\nFinally late Monday, confirming some details of a report in Politico, the House Judiciary Committee said that some staff members had been \u2018\u2018permitted\u2019\u2019 to lend their expertise on immigration to the Trump transition team. Yet leadership was not aware, and earlier in the day committee officials had said that the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, was not consulted on drafting the executive order, so the staff effort appeared to take place behind the backs of top House Republicans, an unusual circumstance.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
