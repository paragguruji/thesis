His order also vastly expanded the list of U.S. family relationships that refugees and visitors from six Muslim-majority countries can use to get into the country, including grandparents and grandchildren.\n\nIn its appeal Friday night, the Justice Department said Watson\u2019s interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on what family relationships qualify refugees and visitors from the six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S. \u2018\u2018empties the court\u2019s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just \u2018close\u2019 family members, but virtually all family members. Treating all of these relationships as \u2018close familial relationship(s)\u2019 reads the term \u2018close\u2019 out of the Court\u2019s decision.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly the Supreme Court can decide these issues surrounding the travel ban, the Justice Department said. \u2018\u2018Only this Court can definitively settle whether the government\u2019s reasonable implementation is consistent with this Court\u2019s stay,\u2019\u2019 it said.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

There was no timetable for the Supreme Court to act, but the administration sought quick action to clarify the court\u2019s June opinion.\n\nThe justices now are scattered during their summer recess, so any short-term action would come in written filings.\n\nThe administration has lost most legal challenges on the travel ban, which applies to citizens of Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travelers with a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with a person or an entity in the U.S. The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.\n\nThe Trump administration defined the relationships as people who had a parent, spouse, fiance, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the U.S.\n\nWatson enlarged that group to include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nHawaii Attorney General Douglas S. Chin, who sought the broader definition, said Thursday\u2019s ruling \u2018\u2018makes clear that the U.S. government may not ignore the scope of the partial travel ban as it sees fit.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough,\u2019\u2019 Chin said.", "authors": ["Alicia A.
