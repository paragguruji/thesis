Daily flights to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando will be pared to five per week.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Like an earlier ban that also included Iraqi citizens, it has been blocked from taking effect by the courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmirates said the flight reductions will affect five of its 12 US destinations, with the first cutbacks starting next month.\n\n\u2018\u2018The recent actions taken by the US government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting, and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the US,\u2019\u2019 the carrier said in a statement.\n\nEmirates does not provide financial data for its US operations or individual routes, but said it had seen \u2018\u2018healthy growth and performance\u2019\u2019 until the start of the year. Since Trump took office Jan. 20, however, there has been \u2018\u2018a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our US routes, across all travel segments.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt said it was responding as \u2018\u2018any profit-oriented enterprise would\u2019\u2019 and will use the capacity freed up by the culled routes elsewhere on its network.\n\nThe Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, accounted for 14 percent of the $22.75 billion in revenue Emirates pulled in during the fiscal year through the end of March 2016.\n\nRobert Mann, an aviation consultant, said business travel between the United States and Middle East has clearly been hurt by the ban on gadgets, while the attempted visa bans have put a damper on leisure travel from the targeted countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018Neither factor is a good thing for the Middle Eastern carriers who are primarily affected,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAndrew Lannon, a Canadian attorney based in Dubai, arrived in Fort Lauderdale for vacation on an Emirates flight Wednesday and said passengers had to check their electronics, which made the 18-hour flight difficult because he couldn\u2019t work.\n\nPassengers were told upon landing that they would have to wait on the plane for an hour while their bags were checked, but were then let off after 20 minutes, Lannon said, adding that it took another hour for most passengers to clear customs.\n\nKevin Mitchell, head of the Business Travel Coalition in the United States, said all of the Gulf carriers are probably losing business because of the security measures and attempted travel bans, and for consumers, \u201cit means higher prices, fewer choices, less connectivity.\u2019\u2019\n\nLike its smaller Gulf rivals Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, Emirates has ramped up its US presence and recently launched a service to Newark via Athens.\n\nSeveral big US carriers and their pilot unions have bristled at the Gulf airlines\u2019 US push, accusing them of flooding the market with capacity while receiving billions of dollars of unfair government subsidies.\n\nEmirates and its Gulf rivals deny the allegations.\n\nDespite a lobbying and public relations campaign, the US carriers were unable to persuade the Obama administration to block further expansion by Gulf airlines. But US airline executives made a pitch to restrict their access during a White House meeting with Trump earlier this year.\n\nThe US travel industry, already fretting that the ban on travelers from Muslim-majority nations is affecting travel generally to the United States, expressed fresh concern after Emirates\u2019 announcement, however.\n\n\u2018\u2018The aftermath of 9/11 taught us that we can\u2019t take either global understanding or US market share for granted,\u2019\u2019 said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president of the US Travel Association. \u2018\u2018Every limiting security message needs to be offset by a sincere welcome to legitimate, lawful travelers.\u2019\u2019", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-04-19", "type": "article"}
