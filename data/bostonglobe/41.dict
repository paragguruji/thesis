The U.S. then shared those benchmarks with every country in the world and gave them 50 days to comply.\n\nThe citizens of countries that refused could now face travel restrictions and more stringent screening measures that would last indefinitely, until their governments complied.\n\nTrump last week called for a \u2018\u2018tougher\u2019\u2019 travel ban after a bomb partially exploded on a London subway.\n\n\u2018\u2018The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u2019\u2019 he tweeted.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of overstepping his authority and violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protections against religious bias. Trump had called for a \u2018\u2018total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u2019\u2019 during his campaign.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-24", "type": "article"}
