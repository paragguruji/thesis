Yet the president\u2019s tweets play up something more visceral than any legal brief: the night of blood and terror that left eight dead in London and many questions about British security lapses. Attacks in Kabul and Tehran add to a sense of worldwide chaos tied to Muslim extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFear of terrorism is out of proportion to actual risk, and there\u2019s no evidence a travel ban would reduce the probability of another attack in the United States. But perception matters, and Trump is a master at milking it for his own agenda. \u201cHe could be setting it up (with the Supreme Court) so it\u2019s a political argument: If there\u2019s a terrorist attack, it\u2019s your fault,\u201d said Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which went to court to fight Trump\u2019s first travel ban on grounds that it constituted an unconstitutional \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\n@realdonaldtrump Twitter account FIRST TWEET -- for06travelban from national -- (image source: trump twitter account) --- President Trump lashed out at his own Justice Department Monday for seeking the Supreme Court\u2019s backing for a \u2018\u2018watered down, politically correct version\u2019\u2019 of the travel ban he signed in March instead of pursuing a broader directive that was also blocked by the courts. In a series of early morning tweets, Trump urged the Justice Department to ask for an \u2018\u2018expedited hearing\u2019\u2019 at the high court and seek a \u2018\u2018much tougher version\u2019\u2019 of the order temporarily blocking entry to the U.S. from a half-dozen majority Muslim countries. He called the courts, which have blocked both versions of the travel ban, \u2018\u2018slow and political.\u2019\u2019 If there\u2019s a method to Trump\u2019s Twitter madness, Rose notes that he hasn\u2019t coordinated it with his own lawyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect,\u201d she said. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

After the London attack, Trump posted a series of tweets referring to his revised ban as \u201ca watered-down politically correct version\u201d and calling for a \u201cmuch tougher version\u201d in the future. That conflicts with arguments of Justice Department lawyers, who say the Supreme Court should only consider the actual language of the executive order, without second-guessing Trump\u2019s Twitter-expressed goals or motivations.\n\nGeorge Conway \u2014 the husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who withdrew his name from consideration for a top Justice Department position \u2014 made headlines when he tweeted that while Trump\u2019s tweets may make some people \u201cfeel better,\u201d they won\u2019t help the travel order get the five votes the president needs on the Supreme Court, and \u201cthat is what actually matters. Sad.\u201d\n\nYet Trump may get the votes he needs, for legal reasons as well as some political ones. If so, it won\u2019t be the first time real-world concerns influenced a high court ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts famously found a way to uphold Obamacare because he didn\u2019t want to upend a major executive initiative, not to mention cause millions of Americans to lose health insurance coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs explained in The New York Times, it takes four votes to grant the Supreme Court review sought by Trump. The government also wants the court to set aside the rulings that block the travel ban. It takes five votes to do that. \u201cThis order has been the subject of passionate political debate,\u201d the government\u2019s brief states. \u201cBut whatever one\u2019s views, the precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s national security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order and this constitutional moment.\u201d\n\nDo Supreme Court justices really want to deny Trump\u2019s authority to call the shots on national security and immigration policy? If anything bad happens, Trump will be happy to do what he always does \u2014 pass the buck right to them.\n\nIt takes real courage to stand up to real fear-mongering.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-07", "type": "article"}
