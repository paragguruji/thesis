The administration has given itself a Thursday deadline for implementing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmilaji, 35, moved to Canada this month to pursue his master\u2019s degree at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. He said it\u2019s unfortunate he had to withdraw from Brown, but \u2018\u2018bad things happen and you have to adapt.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s still working with his mentors at the Ivy League school as he tries to reopen a large underground hospital for women and children in northwest Syria. He plans to get specialists at Brown to train hospital staff online and answer their questions about complicated cases.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

He\u2019s working with Canadian doctors to establish safe health facilities in Syria, train medical workers and connect hospitals. The group formed the Canadian International Medical Relief Organization.\n\nAlmilaji received a letter last week from the governor general of Canada stating that he\u2019s a recipient of the Meritorious Service Medal. The governor general is the queen\u2019s representative in Canada and recognizes exceptional individuals on her behalf and on behalf of all Canadians. The other co-founders of CIMRO, Mark Cameron and Jay Dahman, are also receiving the medal.\n\nAlmilaji was earning a master\u2019s degree in public health at Brown University when the travel ban first went into effect in January. He went to Turkey for a brief trip after the fall semester and got stuck overseas while his pregnant wife remained in the U.S.\n\nThey were reunited in Toronto this month and are expecting a baby girl in August.\n\nCourtesy of Khaled Almilaji via AP Khaled Almilaji with his wife, Jehan, in Toronto.\n\nThis week\u2019s Supreme Court order partially reinstated the ban, allowing the administration to block travelers from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen unless they can prove a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with a person or entity in the United States. The court\u2019s guidance said that a student admitted to study at an American university would fit that exception.\n\nAlmilaji travels to Turkey to oversee projects in Syria. He said he was told by lawyers that if he did return to the United States, it would be unwise to leave again.\n\n\u2018\u2018It would take away my basic rights of movement and seeing my family and the work that I love and commit to, to my people,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s really unfair.\u2019\u2019\n\nCanada, he said, affords him guaranteed experience and knowledge to pursue his work in a better way.\n\nAlmilaji has launched an advocacy and awareness campaign, Care4SyrianKids, with Brown classmates. When Syria is stable enough, he wants to return and work on preventing diseases and other health problems.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-28", "type": "article"}
