But lawyers who had filed the suit said they did not know that the visas had already been revoked, under the now-public State Department memo.\n\nLawyers said they expect to seek a new restraining order based on a federal court ruling Tuesday in Los Angeles that barred the Trump administration from revoking the visas of people from the seven countries, among other provisions. A hearing in theBoston case is scheduled for Friday, and lawyers said they will raise concerns about the memo then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, a State Department official said the department revoked the visas at the request of the Department of Homeland Security after Trump\u2019s order to ban people from the seven nations for 90 days. Visa holders from those countries who are already in the United States are not affected, and the ban does not apply to people with diplomatic visas.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the inspector general at Homeland Security announced it will review Homeland Security\u2019s implementation of the president\u2019s executive order.\n\nThe inspector general plans to \u201creview DHS\u2019 adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel\u2019\u2019 and would consider \u201cincluding other issues that may arise during the course of the review.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order Friday affects a wide swath of people. The order also halted refugees worldwide from entering the United States for 120 days \u2014 with an exception for 872 people this week. The order also barred Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nIn the days since the order was issued, federal officials have sought to clarify who is affected by it and have said that some people from those countries will still be allowed into the country on waivers.\n\nGreen Card holders, for example, are not affected by the order, the White House said Wednesday. Iraqis who worked with the US military and government will also be allowed to enter the United States under a special visa program, according to the State Department.\n\nTrump defended his order on Twitter Wednesday, a day after his Homeland Security secretary said it was \u201cnot, I repeat, not, a ban on Muslims.\u201d During his campaign, Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the order was a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d to review the visa-vetting system. He said federal officials will analyze the current system over the next 30 days and then provide foreign countries 60 days to cooperate with the government\u2019s national security requirements.\n\n\u201cThis way we can ensure the system is doing what it is designed to do, which is protect the American people,\u201d Kelly said Tuesday. \u201cThis analysis is long overdue and strongly supported by the Department\u2019s career intelligence officials.\u201d\n\nIn the court fight, the ACLU of Massachusetts and others argue that the president\u2019s ban is unconstitutional and clearly discriminates against Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn other words: if an executive order looks like a Muslim ban, acts like a Muslim ban, and has been talked about as a Muslim ban, then it\u2019s probably a Muslim ban,\u201d the ACLU argued in a filing Wednesday.\n\nThey and others filed the lawsuit late Saturday in Boston that led to the seven-day halt on Trump\u2019s order \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t clear until Wednesday that the court\u2019s ruling did not have the weight the lawyers hoped it did.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Zara Rejaee, a US citizen originally from Iran who serves as a radiation control officer for the state Department of Public Health, said her 21-year-old cousin Arash Azari Matin had hoped to return to the United States based on the Boston ruling. After a semester at Los Angeles Pierce College, he went home for winter break to see his parents and has been blocked from returning. He has a student visa to attend the $26,000-a-year school.\n\nAfter the Boston ruling, she said he tried to book a flight to Boston with multiple airlines but was told no.\n\n\u201cThey said we\u2019re not going to let anybody with an Iranian passport board the plane,\u201d Rejaee said, meaning the airlines.\n\nSamira Asgari, 30, said the same thing happened to her. An Iranian infectious disease scientist in Switzerland who had lawfully obtained a visa to conduct research at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, she was twice prevented from boarding a flight, she said in a separate lawsuit filed Wednesday.\n\nThe Boston judges\u2019 ruling in the ACLU suit prohibited federal officials from detaining or deporting immigrants and refugees with valid visas or green cards or forcing them to undergo extra security screenings based solely on Trump\u2019s order. The judges also instructed Customs and Border Protection to notify airlines overseas that they were allowed to put immigrants on US-bound flights.\n\nLawyers who filed the lawsuit in Boston vowed to continue fighting in court. The initial lawsuit was filed on behalf of two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professors, Mazdak Pourabdollah Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam, who were interrogated at Logan upon flying back into the country. The married couple are green card holders from Iran who were later released.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the ACLU of Massachusetts named six more plaintiffs in that lawsuit, including five Iranian citizens and Oxfam America, an international aid organization based in Boston. Attorney General Maura Healey has also attempted to sign on to the ACLU suit.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs also filed an expanded complaint raising concerns that immigrants with visas to study or work in the United States are being prevented from coming into the country. The new complaint also says immigrants in the United States with visas are now unable to leave because they fear they will not be allowed to return.\n\nThe executive director of ACLU of Massachusetts also questioned the timing of the public release of the State Department memo.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU of Massachusetts believes the timing and release of the Department of State\u2019s memo is deeply suspicious \u2014 and raises more questions than it answers,\u201d said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.\n\nOver the weekend, tens of thousands of people protested at airports and in cities across the country. Trump also fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, for refusing to enforce Trump\u2019s order. Her replacement ordered the Justice Department to defend it in court.\n\nFollow her on Twitter @mariasacchetti", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
