Exempt from the ban were those able to prove a \u201cbona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\u201d such as family, employers, or educational institutions. Grandparents were among the family members who were not granted exemptions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the brief, Healey asserted that people who are deciding whether to work or study in the US will \u201ctake into account whether their close family members will be able to visit them.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

A niece whose foreign aunt was like a mother to her could not bring that aunt to witness and celebrate her wedding. And an orphaned child would not be permitted to receive a visit from the uncle who took care of her financial and emotional needs after her father\u2019s untimely death.\u201d\n\nAlso supporting the brief were New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, a Honolulu judge rejected Hawaii\u2019s bid to curtail the travel ban, saying that the state could directly ask the Supreme Court to clarify its ruling. Hawaii responded late Friday by asking the courts to issue an injunction.\n\nAimee Ortiz can be reached at aimee.ortiz@globe.com .
