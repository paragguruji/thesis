Here\u2019s a look at what they\u2019ve said, gathered from public statements, tweets, and comments to local media.\n\nMAINE\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins called the order \u201coverly broad\u201d and said implementing it will be \u201cimmediately problematic.\u201d Specifically, she said, \u201cit could interfere with the immigration of Iraqis who worked for American forces in Iraq as translators and bodyguards \u2014 people who literally saved the lives of our troops and diplomats during the last decade and whose lives are at risk if they remain in Iraq.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndependent Senator Angus King said through a spokesman that Trump\u2019s actions \u201cdon\u2019t protect us but actually compromise our nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nRepublican Representative Bruce Poliquin was noncommittal about the new policy.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

This order is so ill-considered that it is even barring Iraqi civilians who have provided essential assistance to the U.S. mission,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocratic Senator Maggie Hassan said the order \u201cruns counter to the fundamental values that make America the greatest country on earth.\u201d She said: \u201cIt will also make us less safe. We must always be working to strengthen the vetting process for all entryways into the United States, but discriminating against individuals on the basis of their religion will only harm our national security interests.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Carol Shea-Porter called on President Trump to reverse his order. \u201cI condemn President Trump\u2019s decision to reject fundamental American values,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocratic Representative Annie Kuster tweeted on Sunday that American should be a \u201cbeacon of hope around the world. Urge @realDonaldTrump to honor the values of inclusion that make us truly great.\u201d\n\nVERMONT\n\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic Representative Peter Welch issued a joint statement, saying they deplored the president\u2019s action. \u201cBy imposing a blanket ban on entire nationalities of men, women and children facing horrific violence and devastation, he has allowed fear to triumph over compassion and common sense, they said.\u201d\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren denounced the plan, proclaiming, \u201cWe will not turn away children. We will not turn away families. We will not turn away people who try to help Americans.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Ed Markey said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cfly in the face of our nation\u2019s history as a beacon to those seeking a better life in America. . . . \u201cBuilding a border wall, detaining families and children at our border, and turning back asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution are un-American policies and are antithetical to our time-honored values.\u201d\n\nAnd on Sunday Markey called on the new secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, to denounce and rescind the order.\n\nDemocratic Representative Richard Neal tweeted that the travel order is \u201cwrong, divisive and contrary to America\u2019s core values.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocratic Representative Jim McGovern tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump: This is not how we keep America safe. We must end the #MuslimBan now.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Niki Tsongas tweeted that the travel ban caps a \u201cweek of detrimental actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocratic Representative Joseph Kennedy III, who attended the Sunday protest in Copley Square, tweeted: Solidarity & strength at #CopleySquare today.\n\nDemocratic Representative Katherine Clark called the order \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocratic Representative Seth Moulton said Trump\u2019s policies \u201cput our troops\u2019 lives at risk, empower our enemies, and do not put America first.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Mike Capuano noted that no refugees from any of the countries targeted on Trump\u2019s list have committed terror acts on US soil.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Representative Stephen Lynch called Trump\u2019s action \u201ca shameful violation of our Constitution. We are better than this.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative William Keating said \u201cAmerica is both stronger and truer to its beliefs by rejecting the Trump administration\u2019s executive order which discriminates against an individual religion or nation.\u201d\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nDemocratic Senator Jack Reed said, \u201cAs Americans, we must keep faith with the Constitution & reject Trump\u2019s religious test on refugees before it spreads.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said, \u201cWe all lose when America loses its standing as a place for families fleeing war & persecution to find peace & a chance to build a new life.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative David Cicilline said Trump has \u201cchosen to cruelly demonize refugees\u201d to \u201cgain a short-term political victory.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative James Langevin tweeted: \u201cWe can\u2019t allow democracy to be compromised.\u201d\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy was unequivocal: \u201cThe law is clear. The #MuslimBan is illegal. I will introduce a bill this week to immediately overturn this dangerous, hateful order.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal urged Trump on Twitter to reverse course: \u201cOnly real solution \u2014 President Trump tear up this immoral order.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative John Larson called Trump\u2019s order \u201ccruel and un-American.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Joe Courtney called the order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Rosa DeLauro ridiculed Trump for hosting a screening of the movie \u201cFinding Dory\u201d at the White House over the weekend. \u201cFinding Dory? Maybe @realDonaldTrump should focus on finding compassion.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative James Himes cheered the work of the ACLU and others challenging Trump\u2019s order. \u201cLights against the darkness!\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic Representative Elizabeth Esty noted the timing of Trump\u2019s order, on Holocaust Remembrance Day. \u201cThat our nation issued a #MuslimBan & abandoned families fleeing terror on Holocaust Remembrance Day will forever stain our history.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
