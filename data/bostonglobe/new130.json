This order is about religious tests, and the United States does not impose religious tests, period.\n\nIt is illegal. It is against the Constitution. And it is against the very foundations of our democracy.\n\nLawyers across this country have dropped everything and are doing God\u2019s work fighting for justice.\n\nAnd right here in Boston, we have already got a stay on the president\u2019s order. Can we hear it for the Massachusetts ACLU?\n\nBut we will not stop fighting until this executive order is tossed in the dust bin of history where it belongs.\n\nWe will not stop fighting for our Constitution, and for our constitutional principles.\n\nWe will not let Donald Trump chip away at the very heart of our democracy.\n\nSo from right here in Boston, let\u2019s say it to people all across Massachusetts, all across this country, and all around this world: we will not turn our backs on refugees and immigrants.\n\nWe will not give ISIS more material for recruiting based on religious hate.\n\nWe will stand for Massachusetts values, we will stand for American values, we will stand for human values.\n\nWe will not be divided by Donald Trump\u2019s hateful divisions. We will not.\n\nToday, we will stand together with our Muslim brothers and sisters and we will say an attack on one of us, is an attack on all of us.\n\nWe will fight back. We will fight back in the courts, we will fight back in Congress, and we will fight back across America.\n\nIt is an honor to be here with you. It is an honor to speak out with you. It is an honor to fight shoulder to shoulder alongside you.\n\nAmerica is a good country. America is a great country. America believes in the dignity of all human beings.\n\nWatch the full speech here:", "authors": ["Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["belongs", "dust", "right", "fight", "massachusetts", "elizabeth", "united", "bin", "trumps", "stand", "history", "donald", "order", "warren", "threat"], "summary": "Senator Elizabeth Warren rallied a crowd of thousands in Boston on Sunday, telling them that she would fight against President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial order for a travel ban.\n\u201cWe will not stop fighting until this executive order is tossed in the dust bin of history where it belongs,\u201d Warren said to raucous cheers.\n\u201cWe will not be divided by Donald Trump\u2019s hateful divisions.\nBut we will not stop fighting until this executive order is tossed in the dust bin of history where it belongs.\nWe will not be divided by Donald Trump\u2019s hateful divisions."}
