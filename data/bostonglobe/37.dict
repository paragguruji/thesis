In both instances, the affected works will be identified by labels stating either that the work was \u201cmade by an immigrant\u201d or \u201cgiven by an immigrant.\u201d The museum is inviting other institutions to join the project, offering similar labels for download at the museum\u2019s website.\n\nThe Davis initiative is one of a handful of related actions by museum professionals in opposition to the travel ban, which has been blocked by the courts. Earlier this month, the Museum of Modern Art in New York rearranged its fifth-floor permanent-collection galleries to exhibit works by artists from some of the affected nations. Late last month, the Association of Art Museum Directors issued a statement that it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that under the executive order \u201cartistic and scholarly collaborations could now be in jeopardy, just at the moment when cultural exchange and understanding are more important than ever.\u201d\n\nA portrait of George Washington by the Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertm\u00fcller will be among those temporarily removed from display.\n\nAmong the affected works at the Wellesley museum will be a portrait of George Washington by the Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertm\u00fcller. The painting, which was given to the museum by the Munn family, who immigrated to the United States from Sweden, will be removed from view over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-15", "type": "article"}
