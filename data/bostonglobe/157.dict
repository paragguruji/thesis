Leshin in hopes of aiding a PhD student and a postdoctoral fellow barred from reentering the United States.\n\n\u201cI am the president of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in the United States of America,\u201d Leshin wrote in the letters issued to the students stuck in Iran. \u201cI ask that anyone presented with this letter should provide [student\u2019s name] with safe passage to travel to the United States in order to continue his studies at WPI.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeshin\u2019s plea was among the many unusual steps that Massachusetts colleges were taking Monday as they scrambled to help students and academics whose careers and education have been thrown into chaos by President Trump\u2019s executive order clamping down on travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nFor a state that prides itself on drawing the brightest minds from around the world, the order was a particularly heavy blow, and its full impact was still being tallied, three days after Trump issued it with little guidance or warning.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

A third sister, Mahboubeh Asgari-Targhi, already works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\n\n\u201cWe are all so shattered,\u201d Ameneh said in a telephone interview Monday, after flying back to Glasgow, where she lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said she and Marzieh may now try to enter the United States through Canada, hoping officials there will allow them to fly on their visas that are designed for visitors participating in work-and-study exchange programs.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up,\u201d Ameneh said. \u201cWe will do our best to find a way.\u201d\n\nTheir sister said she was devastated the two were not allowed to join her at Harvard.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this ban is going to keep terrorists away from this country,\u2019\u2019 Mahboubeh said. \u201cI wish President Trump would put himself in our shoes.\u201d\n\nThe order was also sowing anxiety and upheaval for academics from the affected countries who are already working and studying in Boston.\n\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff Mass Arts students Anisa Hosseinnezhad, left and Samantha Corsini, yelled at Boston University student Nick Fuentes, a supporter of President Trump on Monday.\n\nNortheastern University said it was considering making campus housing available over the summer to 250 students from the seven countries affected by Trump\u2019s immigration order \u2014 concerned that, if they leave the country they won\u2019t be allowed back in.\n\nMany scholars and researchers said they would be unable to travel abroad for conferences, job interviews, or family visits out of those concerns.\n\n\u201cIt feels like being trapped in a prison,\u201d said Sadaf Atarod, a postdoctoral associate at Boston University\u2019s Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\nAtarod said her parents in Iran cannot visit because of Trump\u2019s order, and she cannot leave the country because her student visa only allows her to enter the United States once.\n\nAtarod, an Iranian who grew up in Dubai and the United Kingdom, said she rejected offers to work in the United Kingdom and Singapore and chose to come to Boston because the city is known as a global center of stem-cell research.\n\nNow, she said, she regrets that decision. \u201cWould I want to have a career here? Is it worth it?\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMIT officials said Monday they were still working to help two undergraduates who have been barred from the US because of Trump\u2019s order.\n\nThe university did not disclose where those students were from, although it said it has a total of 47 students from the affected countries \u2014 including 38 from Iran and five from Syria.\n\n\u201cThe executive order on Friday appeared to me a stunning violation of our deepest American values, the values of a nation of immigrants: fairness, equality, openness, generosity, courage,\u201d MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the campus community Monday.\n\nMIT urged students from the affected countries who are traveling abroad to return to Boston as soon as possible and fly directly to Logan International Airport.\n\nLogan is believed to offer greater protections for travelers because a decision issued Saturday by a federal judge in Boston barred US agents at the airport from detaining, deporting, or extensively interrogating travelers from the seven affected nations based on Trump\u2019s order.\n\nBoston University said it was seeking to help two research scholars from Iran who were expected in March but may not be able to travel to Boston and enroll, as scheduled.\n\nThe university said it is planning to make an immigration lawyer available to answer questions from anxious students and faculty at a town-hall meeting on Tuesday.\n\nAll told, BU said it has 102 students and 16 scholars from the affected countries.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
