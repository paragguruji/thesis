Today he\u2019s a lawyer, sitting at a chair and desk in an office that all once belonged to a Ford chief executive officer whose Lincoln Continental he used to park.\n\nMoughni sees the business case behind Ford\u2019s senior executives courting Donald Trump after the president spent months criticizing automakers for making cars in Mexico. Their silence through the weekend on Trump\u2019s order halting immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries was another matter, and he couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a product of what Trump is trying to ban,\u201d Moughni said. \u201cIt\u2019s careless. This is a country of immigrants.\u201d\n\nAutomakers are walking a tightrope as they court Trump, whose policies on clean-air standards, corporate taxes, and trade will affect their fortunes. They have to balance that against other considerations closer to home: The traditional three US automakers are based in Michigan, which backed Trump\u2019s surprise victory but also has a substantial Middle Eastern population troubled by his executive order on immigration.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

From 2005 to 2015, the state accepted 19,545 refugees from Iraq and Syria \u2014 two of the seven countries affected by Trump\u2019s ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople would say that if you landed here at 9 p.m., you can have a job at 9 the next morning,\u201d Ibrahim Kazerooni, the imam at Dearborn\u2019s Islamic Center of America, said in an interview. \u201cWe have many people in our community who work at Ford.

Bill Ford, a great-grandson of the founder Henry, has said he can always get a hold of Trump, or the president calls him. Fields, the CEO, visited the White House on back-to-back days last week to discuss jobs, fuel-economy standards, and even Oval Office decor.\n\nMuch of the auto industry was silent on the immigration order during the weekend. Mark Reuss, GM\u2019s executive vice president for product development, declined to discuss Trump\u2019s immigration policy during a fuel cell vehicles press conference Monday. Representatives for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co., and Honda Motor Co. declined to comment.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
