It appears to increase the odds that the fight over the order would end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump and his aides have argued that the Jan. 27 executive order will make the country safer. It has sparked protests in Boston and around the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a victory for Trump, US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton in Massachusetts refused to extend a temporary stay on the president\u2019s ban in Boston, saying Trump would likely succeed in the case on the grounds that he has broad authority over federal immigration laws.\n\nThe Boston case appeared to be more narrowly drawn than the ruling in Seattle.\n\nThe ACLU of Massachusetts and the American Immigration Lawyers Association\u2019s New England chapter said late Friday that while they were disappointed in the Boston ruling, they believed the rulings in Seattle and a separate one in New York would continue to halt Trump\u2019s travel ban nationwide.\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, in response to the Seattle ruling. \u201cWe live to fight another day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order blocked visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from the United States for 90 days, halted the entire refugee program for 120 days, and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nFederal officials disclosed Friday that nearly 60,000 visas \u2014 and perhaps as many as 100,000 \u2014 were revoked as a result of the ban, which Massachusetts officials said thrust hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses and colleges into turmoil. Professors, scientists, and doctors who left the United States were shocked to discover that they could not return home.\n\n\u201cWhile this Court is sympathetic to the difficult personal circumstances in which these plaintiffs find themselves, if they choose to leave the country, as nonresident aliens, they have no right to re-enter,\u201d Gorton said in the 21-page ruling.\n\nThe restraining order in Boston, issued in the middle of the night last weekend, expires early Sunday morning.\n\nThe government\u2019s lawyer made clear during the Boston hearing Friday that visa holders who live in the United States now may not be allowed to return if they leave the country.\n\nThe Massachusetts judge\u2019s swift ruling \u2014 just five hours after lawyers from the ACLU and state Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s office had argued in court that the ban discriminated against Muslims \u2014 marked a crushing defeat in a state that voted against Trump and rallied strongly against his Jan. 27 executive order.\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker, a Republican, and immigrant advocates intensified their opposition Friday to Trump\u2019s order, saying it affected companies and schools, including the University of Massachusetts, which has 300 students and 160 faculty and staff from the seven countries.\n\nIn addition, the Massachusetts Senate had passed a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s order, and the state\u2019s entire congressional delegation, all Democrats, had opposed the ban.\n\nLawyers said the restraining order cleared the way for several immigrants to return to the United States Friday to cheers and applause at Logan International Airport. But the celebration did not last.\n\nAfter the ruling, the ACLU of Massachusetts vowed to continue fighting the ban in court. The group called Trump\u2019s order \u201cillegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for the Department of Justice defended Trump\u2019s order in Boston federal court, saying the United States has broad powers over immigration laws and has the right to revoke visas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re essentially reading this as a Muslim ban, because that\u2019s what they want to see,\u201d said Joshua Press, the Department of Justice lawyer who defended Trump\u2019s order in court.\n\nHe reiterated that nothing in Trump\u2019s executive order explicitly banned Muslims, a point the ACLU challenged. When the judge asked if visa holders might be barred from reentry if they left the United States, Press said yes.\n\nHomeland Security issued a statement after the Boston ruling saying the order imposed a \u201c90-day pause\u201d on travel of citizens from the seven nations and reiterated it did not apply to green card holders, dual citizens, or people with diplomatic visas.\n\nOfficials said Trump\u2019s order allowed the government over the next 30 days to review which nations are failing to provide adequate information about their citizens who travel to the United States. Then the nations will be given 60 days to provide that information.\n\n\u201cPrincipally, the goal is to ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward the United States and its founding principles,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe Boston lawsuit and restraining order were among the first legal challenges to Trump\u2019s executive order, though other lawsuits have sprung up across the country.\n\nIn addition to the ruling in Seattle Friday, a judge in New York agreed to extend a restraining order to Feb. 21, and a federal judge in Los Angeles imposed a restraining order against the travel ban.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the Seattle ruling would affect visa holders hoping to travel to Boston. Homeland Security officials declined to comment.\n\nSupporters of immigrants who returned to Logan on a Lufthansa flight from Germany Friday said some had left the United States for work or travel or to visit family only to discover that they could not return.\n\nOn Friday, they were welcomed at Terminal E with signs, flowers, and applause, and US Representatives Joseph Kennedy Jr. and James McGovern.\n\nBanah Alhanfy, a citizen of Iraq, was the first passenger from a banned nation to arrive Friday, shortly before 2 p.m. She fell into arms of family members waiting in Boston.\n\nHer uncle, Aqeel Mohialdeen of Maine, hugged her tightly, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cAfter the executive order, the whole family didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said.\n\nAlhanfy said her visa had been issued later than those of her relatives and that they had arrived in the United States ahead of her. She had been barred from her original flight in Iraq due to the travel ban, but said she changed her destination to Turkey and traveled to Germany, where she boarded a Boston-bound flight.\n\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute student Behnam Partopour was met at the airport by theschool\u2019s president, Laurie Leshin, and McGovern, as well as a friend, Ehsan Keyvani, who held a sign that read, \u201cLet him come home.\u201d\n\nPartopour, who was also on the Lufthansa flight, met the media wearing a blue blazer and carrying a champagne-colored rose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Worcester more than two years. It is my second home,\u201d Partopour said.\n\nAlso returning Friday was Niki Mossafer Rahmati, an engineering student at MIT who had spent winter break in her native Iran.\n\n\u201cWe can all be glad that our affected undergraduates have overcome their immediate immigration difficulties and are back with us,\u201d MIT president L. Rafael Reif wrote Friday in an e-mail to the university community.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
