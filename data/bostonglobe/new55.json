It also asks the high court to lift a nationwide injunction issued by a federal judge in a separate Hawaii case. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers Hawaii, heard the government\u2019s arguments in that case last month, but has not yet ruled.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

The justices are scheduled to end their work at the end of the month. And the ban, if it is allowed to be enforced, is proposed as temporary, just to give the government 90 days to study and implement new vetting procedures. Acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall has said that the ruling in the Hawaii case has prevented the government from moving forward on those objectives.\n\nTrump on Jan.27, just a week after inauguration, issued the first travel ban executive order. It barred the entry of citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations (Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya), ordered a temporary halt to refugee arrivals and would have eventually given preference to those who were religious minorities in their countries, such as Christians.\n\nSeveral judges and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit shut it down.\n\nTrump vowed to go to the Supreme Court that time, too, but eventually issued a new order. That order, the subject of the 4th Circuit ruling, removed Iraq from the list, deleted references to religion and added national security rationales for the policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it was stopped by federal district judges in Maryland and Hawaii.\n\nIn the 4th Circuit, which covers Maryland, six judges agreed in full with an opinion by Chief Judge Roger Gregory that the national security rationale advanced by the president was simply pretext for unlawful animosity toward Muslims, and an attempt to make good on a campaign promise to bar Muslims from entry into the country.\n\nHe cited Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and statements made when he signed the executive orders, and said courts had an obligation to look beyond their seemingly neutral language.\n\nThe order \u2018\u2018speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination,\u2019\u2019 Gregory wrote. \u2018\u2018Surely the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment yet stands as an untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most cherished founding principles-that government shall not establish any religious orthodoxy, or favor or disfavor one religion over another.\u2019\u2019\n\nTwo of the judges agreed with the majority that the order likely violates the constitutional command that government not favor or disparage one religion over another. But they also said the order was not justified under the power that Congress gives the president by law.\n\nThat broad power says that \u2018\u2018whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens ... would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may ... suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants.\u2019\u2019\n\nCongress later added, though that \u2018\u2018no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\u2019\u2019\n\nJudge Barbara Milano Keenan said that Trump had made no finding that the citizens of the six countries provided a specific threat to the U.S. And Judge James Wynn Jr. said Congress did not give the president power to take action based on \u2018\u2018invidious discrimination.\u2019\u2019\n\nAll of the judges ruling against Trump were nominated to the appeals court by Democratic presidents. The three dissenting judges were nominated by Republicans, and said their colleagues had wandered into uncharted territory by relying on campaign statements to find an Establishment Clause violation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds - one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation\u2019\u2019 wrote Judge Paul Niemeyer.\n\nAnd the others said that the majority cast aside the enormous power that the president possesses to take actions that keep the country safe.\n\n\u2018\u2018The real losers in this case are the millions of individual Americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm,\u2019\u2019 wrote Judge Dennis Shedd.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Ann E.
