Trump walked across the South Lawn towards the White House on Sunday.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is preparing to sign a revised executive order temporarily barring the entry of people from certain Muslim-majority countries and halting the nation\u2019s refugee program.\n\nA White House official says plans to roll out the order are on track for Monday. The official insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the order ahead of the official announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new order has been in the works since shortly after a federal court blocked Trump\u2019s initial effort, but the administration has repeatedly pushed back the signing as it has worked to better coordinate with the agencies that it will need to implement the ban.\n\nTrump administration officials have said the new order aims to overcome the legal challenges to the first. Its goal will be the same: keep would-be terrorists out of the United States while the government reviews the vetting system for refugees and visa applicants from certain parts of the world.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

That follows pressure from the Pentagon and State Department, which had urged the White House to reconsider, given Iraq\u2019s key role in fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nAccording to a draft version of the new order outlined to lawmakers late last week, citizens of the other six countries will face the 90-day suspension of visa processing as the administration continues to analyze how to enhance vetting procedures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther changes are also expected, including making clear that all existing visas will be honored and no longer singling out Syrian refugees for an indefinite ban. Syrian refugees will now be treated like other refugees and be subjected to a 120-day suspension of the refugee program.\n\nThe new version is also expected to remove language that would give priority for religious minorities. Critics had accused the administration of adding such language to help Christians get into the United States while excluding Muslims.\n\nTrump signed his original executive order in late January, sparking confusion and anger as travelers were detained at US airports and barred from boarding flights at foreign airports.\n\nThe signing is expected to spark a new round of lawsuits and controversy.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-05", "type": "article"}
