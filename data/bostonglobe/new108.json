Technology Leadership Council. \u201cHe\u2019s had a series of significant defeats on this bad policy, and one of them got walked back a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany in Massachusetts said they would watch carefully to see how Trump implements the policy, and some remained concerned that the ban would damage the reputation of the United States \u2014 and Massachusetts \u2014 as a place to work and study.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

She said the policy \u201cundermines the rule of law and imposes serious harm on families, businesses, universities, and the medical community in Massachusetts and across the country.\u201d\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker reaffirmed his opposition to the travel ban, which he said would have \u201cdire consequences\u201d for the state. He said he is pleased the court did not allow all aspects of the order to take effect.\n\n\u201cThe good news . . . is many of the folks who come here for personal reasons, who come here to work, who come here to study, who come here for health care, who come here to serve as fellows at our great universities \u2014 it appears to us that those folks will continue to be able to travel freely to and from the United States, which is a great sign, and to and from the Commonwealth,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe do remain concerned, however, about some of the issues associated with refugee populations, and others who are seeking asylum.\u201d\n\nThe region\u2019s academic centers, including Harvard University, said their legal teams were studying the decision, but they reiterated that drawing from an international pool of students and faculty was crucial to their mission and helps to spur innovation, understanding, and scientific breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about tapping the world\u2019s best and brightest,\u201d said Jigisha Patel, assistant general counsel at Northeastern University, which has more than 250 students from targeted countries. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as a country that\u2019s not welcoming.\u201d\n\nFor the 31 students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute who are from the targeted countries, the Supreme Court decision is a relief, said David Bunis, a senior vice president and general counsel. WPI was among several universities challenging the ban in court.\n\nHowever, Bunis said, the ruling leaves many questions unanswered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill parents of these students be able to get a visa to visit their children?
