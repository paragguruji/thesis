Sarmiento, right, of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, addresses the media during a news conference in front of city hall with other immigration rights activists in Santa Ana, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2016. The organizations were voicing their support for the city becoming a sanctuary city.\n\nThe Trump administration is not done targeting immigrants for deportation \u2014 even those who are in the country lawfully.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post (and others, including The Wall Street Journal), the Trump administration is studying whether to deport legal immigrants already living in the country if they\u2019ve received some welfare benefits. The reports are based on drafts of executive orders circulating among Trump administration officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a policy, if enacted, appears to reflect a fundamental tenet of Trump\u2019s political doctrine: Immigrants are the ultimate political props, useful as scapegoats for an assortment of woes, including terrorism and chronic unemployment in depressed areas.\n\nThe president seems to have taken at face value the narrative coursing through right wing talk radio and blogs, that the foreign-born have nothing to contribute to the future of the country and are just here to steal welfare benefits.\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

Research shows that immigrants are less likely to use public assistance than are native-born citizens. And federal law already bars even many legal immigrants from tapping government benefits. Unauthorized immigrants and workers, or students on temporary visas, are generally not eligible to receive them at all, and green card holders are eligible only after five years. Besides, green card holders are generally working and paying taxes, so why shouldn\u2019t they be eligible for benefits?\n\nBut that\u2019s not all Trump is considering: Another leaked draft would severely limit work visas and micromanage foreign workers employed on US soil. (One example: It calls for site visits at companies that employ foreign workers.) It also instructs federal agencies to compile a report on \u201cthe steps they are taking to combat the birth tourism phenomenon,\u201d referring to the tide of foreign citizens Trump seems to believe have inundated America to give birth so their children will have US citizenship.\n\nIf enacted, the order that mandates deporting legal immigrants who have received welfare benefits will probably rip families apart. There are millions of so-called mixed-status families in the United States, with children who were born here to noncitizen parents. Using government benefits isn\u2019t a crime and, in some cases, like food stamps, the government actually encourages poor families who are eligible to use them. Trump\u2019s order would punish on-the-books immigrants who have followed the rules, and in some cases even followed the government\u2019s advice, an especially unfair policy for a president who claims to value legal immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining to Trump\u2019s threats, it\u2019s that they are already forcing a full-scale discussion about the true benefits of an immigrant-friendly nation. Trump-like thinking on immigration is not new, and, throughout the country\u2019s history, waves of xenophobia have eventually succumbed to policies that embrace immigrants. Trump\u2019s draft order is an assault on all immigrants, whether they use government benefits or not. But it is also an opportunity for another generation to relearn America\u2019s founding lesson: Immigrants make America great.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "type": "article"}
