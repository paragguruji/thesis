The court said the president\u2019s powers to limit immigration \u201care undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the opinion also signaled that some of the justices might believe Trump exceeded even that broad authority when he twice sought to impose a blanket ban on entry into the United States from particular, Muslim-majority countries.\n\nWith the limits imposed Monday by the court, the government\u2019s travel ban will be far more limited than the one he proposed in his first week in office and a later, revised ban.\n\nFor Trump, the court opinion is a rare legal victory after months in which the lower courts repeatedly chastised him for imposing a de facto ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nIn May, the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., said the president\u2019s revised order \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the court opinion would allow the department \u201cto largely implement the president\u2019s executive order.\u201d Trump used similar language in his statement, saying his travel ban would now \u201cbecome largely effective.\u201d\n\nCritics of the ban disputed those assessments. Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the opinion meant the ban would not apply to many people while the court case proceeds.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision could also lead to months of administrative and legal wrangling as consular officials try to determine which individuals are allowed to seek entry into the United States and which are barred by the opinion.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be monitoring all of that,\u201d said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nThe justices said the distinction should be easy to administer. \u201cIn practical terms, this means that\u201d the executive order \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas, who issued a partial dissent Monday that was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, warned that the court\u2019s opinion would \u201cprove unworkable\u201d for officials at consulates around the world and would invite \u201ca flood of litigation\u201d from people denied entry.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nBased on the dissent, those three justices are likely to vote in favor of the Trump administration. The court\u2019s four-member liberal bloc \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan \u2014 are likely to vote against it.\n\nThat leaves the ultimate fate of the ban in the hands of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions called the court\u2019s decision an \u201cimportant step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government\u201d and he expressed confidence that the court would uphold the president\u2019s travel ban in its entirety after it heard the case this fall.\n\nSome opponents of the travel ban said they worried about the fate of people who might be barred from entry into the United States in the meantime. \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling will leave refugees stranded in difficult and dangerous situations abroad,\u201d said Hardy Vieux, legal director of Human Rights First. \u201cMany of these individuals may not have \u2018bona fide relationships,\u2019 but have strong reasons to look to the United States for protection.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s revised order, issued in March, limited travel from six mostly Muslim countries for 90 days and suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days. The time was needed, it said, to address gaps in the government\u2019s screening and vetting procedures.\n\nTwo federal appeals courts had blocked critical parts of the order. The administration had asked that the lower court ruling be stayed while the case moved forward. The court granted part of that request in its unsigned opinion.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "type": "article"}
