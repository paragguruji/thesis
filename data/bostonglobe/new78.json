He praised the plaintiffs in the case for their willingness to join the litigation.\n\n\u201cWe are now shifting fronts in the battle against the Trump Administration\u2019s unjust actions,\u201d Segal said. \u201cAs pioneers of freedom here in Massachusetts, we will continue to work every day in the courts, in the state Legislature, and in our communities to defend and preserve liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttorney General Maura Healey, whose office had joined the Boston lawsuit, withdrew from the complaint earlier month and joined other states in a similar suit in Washington.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The two were later released.\n\nThe ACLU had won an emergency restraining order in a middle-of-the-night hearing that led activists to urge people affected by the ban to fly into Boston, because it was one of the few airports in the country protected by a restraining order.\n\nBut on Feb. 3., US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton refused to extend the temporary restraining order. Hours after Gorton\u2019s decision, however, a federal judge in Seattle issued a restraining order that applied nationwide to halt the ban, making the Boston case moot.\n\nA federal appeals court later upheld the Seattle judge\u2019s decision, which led the administration to issue a new order March 6. That order, which was slated to take effect March 16, has also been temporarily halted by courts in Maryland and Hawaii.\n\nMilton J. Valencia can be reached at milton.valencia@globe.com .
