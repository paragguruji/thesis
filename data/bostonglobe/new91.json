Meanwhile, protesters continued to gather at airports around the country, and Barack Obama weighed in with his first public comments since leaving office.\n\nIn refusing to defend the order, Yates issued a strong statement of dissent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\u201d Yates, a career federal prosecutor from Georgia, wrote in a letter to the agency\u2019s attorneys. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.\u201d\n\nTrump replaced Yates with Dana Boente, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who was named to his post by Obama. His temporary post as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official may last just a few days.\n\n\u201cI am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,\u201d the White House statement quoted Boente as saying.\n\nThe events immediately drew comparisons to President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Massacre,\u2019\u2019 when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and the deputy attorney general resigned rather than follow an order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Sessions\u2019 nomination Tuesday morning, which could set up a vote by the full Senate on Friday. Democrats have been calling for a delay on the vote, but they would need Republicans to join in that call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith world leaders, US diplomats, and the chief executive of Ford Motor Co. also criticizing the executive order on immigration, the White House defended the decision Monday by claiming the need for enhanced national security.\n\nJ. David Ake/Associated Press/File 2016 Acting attorney general Sally Yates, fired later Monday, said that she was not \u201cconvinced that the executive order is lawful.\u201d\n\nThe order, which was signed Friday, tested the powers of the presidency. Multiple federal courts, including one in Boston, ruled against parts of the directive in preliminary orders over the weekend. As members of Congress returned to Washington Monday, they called his moves unconstitutional, un-American, and poorly coordinated, raising sharp questions about the spirit behind the bans but also about White House competence.\n\nDemocrats were united in opposing Trump\u2019s order and introduced legislation to upend it. Republicans were more muted \u2014 particularly the House and Senate GOP leadership \u2014 but a growing number from the president\u2019s own party said he acted rashly and in a way that runs counter to his stated goal of making the country safe.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused the Trump administration of being in contempt of a court\u2019s temporary restraining order. Citing a case from California, Feinstein said the administration ignored a stay and sent a student intercepted in Los Angeles back to her home country even though she had a valid student visa.\n\nWhile introducing a bill to repeal Trump\u2019s executive order, she said that it not just violated bedrock American values but was executed so poorly that it sowed further \u201cchaos and confusion.\u2019\u2019 Government officials from high-ranking administration personnel to individual customs agents at the nation\u2019s airports struggled to apply the rules during the weekend.\n\nTrump lashed out early Monday, saying the news media was blowing the situation out of proportion. In the morning, he even falsely blamed Delta for the delays.\n\n\u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning,\u201d he wrote on Twitter at 7:16 a.m. \u201cBig problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage.\u201d\n\nThe computer issues occurred for about five hours on Sunday night, long after Trump\u2019s order was implemented and after those with green cards and visas were detained as they arrived at US airports.\n\nTrump also criticized Senate minority leader Charles Schumer for tearing up on Sunday when he stood with immigrants and called Trump\u2019s decision \u201cmean spirited and un-American.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears,\u201d Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with business leaders. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask him who is his acting coach.\u201d\n\nDuring an hourlong briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was peppered with questions about the executive order.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s going to be very proactive with protecting this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait until we get attacked and figure out how we can make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201d\n\nAsked about the abrupt imposition of the new restrictions, Spicer said there was no specific threat that prompted Trump\u2019s signing of the order.\n\nA key point of confusion was over foreigners who are permanent residents with green cards. Numerous green card holders were detained at airports Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that green card holders would not be affected, apparently walking back a controversial element of the executive order.\n\nBut Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said he was told by Department of Homeland Security officials that people with valid green cards still were being detained and then given a waiver if agents could determine they posed no threat to the United States.\n\nA spokesman for Obama said that the former president \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d He also indicated support for the protests.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany denounced the order, saying that it \u201cruns counter to the basic idea of international refugee aid and to international cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe necessary, resolute fight against terrorism in no way justifies a blanket suspicion against people of a certain faith \u2014 in this case Muslims \u2014 or a certain origin,\u201d Merkel said.\n\nSenator Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat, said his party is \u201c100 percent united in opposition to this executive order.\u201d\n\nMarkey and other Democrats are also calling on the Senate GOP leadership to delay a vote on Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, until he answers questions about the latest executive order.\n\nWhile Democrats charge that Trump\u2019s order violates the Constitution, Republican critics for the most part stopped short of that accusation. The harshest GOP attacks focused more on criticism that Trump\u2019s order goes against American values, puts the country at increased terrorist risk, and was poorly considered and crafted.\n\n\u201cI am deeply troubled by the appearance of [a] religious ban,\u201d Senator Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe use of an overly broad executive order is not the way to strengthen national security. I encourage the administration to partner with Congress to find a solution.\u201d\n\nSenator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said that he was worried about Iraqi pilots who are trained in Tucson, and he remained concerned over interpreters who have helped American troops.\n\n\u201cI worry a lot about our interpreters who literally put their lives in danger when they\u2019re not allowed to come to the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine said Trump should have worked with relevant agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Defense.\n\n\u201cThose are the entities whose advice he should have sought so that he could thoroughly vet the implications of the order,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked whether Congress should take action to revise the order, Collins said she hopes it will be worked out through the courts and the Trump administration.\n\nGlobe correspondent Tyler Pager contributed to this report.
