Above: Trump on Monday.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a series of Twitter posts Monday morning, President Trump may have irretrievably undermined his lawyers\u2019 efforts to persuade the Supreme Court to reinstate his executive order limiting travel from six predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nSaying he preferred the original travel ban, \u201cnot the watered down, politically correct version\u201d he had issued in March, Trump attacked both the Justice Department and the federal courts.\n\nThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court has asked people and groups challenging the executive order to file their responses to the government\u2019s briefs next Monday. Those responses will almost certainly rely on Trump\u2019s tweets in arguing that the justices should not revive the order.\n\nThe court will probably act on the government\u2019s requests in the coming weeks.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

He said they may help some people \u201cfeel better\u201d but won\u2019t help get five votes on the Supreme Court.\n\nLast week, lawyers in the solicitor general\u2019s office filed polished briefs in the Supreme Court. They urged the justices to ignore incendiary statements from Trump during the presidential campaign, including a call for a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nThe court should focus instead on the text of the revised executive order and statements from Trump after he had taken the inaugural oath to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution,\u201d the briefs said.\n\nTrump, his lawyers said, was now a changed man, alert to the burdens and responsibilities of his office.\n\n\u201cTaking that oath marks a profound transition from private life to the nation\u2019s highest public office, and manifests the singular responsibility and independent authority to protect the welfare of the nation that the Constitution reposes in the president,\u201d they wrote.\n\nOn Twitter early Monday, though, Trump appeared to say that the latest executive order was of a piece with the earlier one, issued in January, and with his longstanding positions.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nIn calling the revised order \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d Trump suggested that his goal throughout had been to exclude travelers based on religion. And in calling the revised order \u201cwatered down,\u201d he made it harder for his lawyers to argue that it was a clean break from the earlier one, which had mentioned religion.\n\nIn his posts, Trump seemed to betray a misunderstanding of how two branches of the federal government work. His criticism of the Justice Department was misplaced, as it works for him. He could have insisted that it defend his original order. It was Trump\u2019s decision, too, to issue the revised order.\n\nTrump also suggested the Supreme Court could impose a tougher version of his executive order: \u201cThe Justice Department should ask for an expedited hearing on the watered-down travel ban before the Supreme Court and seek a much tougher version!\u201d\n\nBut the court\u2019s role is limited to evaluating the lawfulness of the current order.\n\nInsulting judges is also generally a poor litigation strategy. But Trump also posted that \u201cthe courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s adversaries certainly welcomed his tweets.\n\n\u201cIt just adds to the mountain of already existing evidence that the government has had to ask the court over and over to ignore,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people and groups challenging the law.\n\n\u201cBlinding the courts to a reality that everyone else is aware of is never an attractive position,\u2019\u2019 Jadwat said, \u201cbut is especially problematic when you have to ignore in real time what\u2019s being said by the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nNeal K. Katyal, who represents Hawaii in a separate challenge to the order, said there was a yawning gap between Trump\u2019s tweets and his lawyers\u2019 filings.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s statements, before, during, and after his inauguration, continually demonstrate what his so-called travel ban is really about,\u201d Katyal said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising his story and his tweets don\u2019t match up with what the solicitor general has been trying to say in court.\u201d\n\nThere was also daylight between the president and his aides about what to call the executive order.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nBut his own staff members had insisted it was not a travel ban. Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, spent much of one early briefing telling reporters not to call it that. \u201cIt\u2019s not a travel ban,\u201d Spicer insisted.\n\nAt the time, John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, also rejected the phrase. \u201cThis is not a travel ban,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting system.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s posts came as Kellyanne Conway went on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and chastised the news media for focusing too much on the president\u2019s Twitter feed, calling it an \u201cobsession.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe revised executive order, which the president criticized Monday, took Iraq off the list of countries that would be affected and made clear that the restrictions did not apply to those who held green cards or valid visas. It also eliminated a provision that seemed to prioritize Christian refugees for entry.\n\nThe revised order, like the first, barred all refugees from entering the country for 120 days. It limited entry for 90 days for visitors from six countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nThe administration said it chose those six nations and Iraq from a list of \u201ccountries of concern\u201d identified in a law signed by President Obama in 2015. But experts have said that since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from any of those countries.\n\nMost acts of terrorism in the United States in the past 15 years were committed by American citizens or legal residents.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "type": "article"}
