They were coerced into giving up their immigrant visas, they argue, and quickly put on a return flight to Ethiopia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat figure was immediately disputed by the State Department, which said the number of visas revoked was roughly 60,000. Virginia Elliott, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department, said the revocation has no impact on the legal status of people already in the United States. If those people were to leave U.S. soil and try to return, the visas would no longer be valid.\n\nDuring the hearing in federal court in Alexandria, Erez Reuveni from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation, could not say how many people with visas were sent back to their home countries from Dulles in response to the travel ban. However, he did say that all people with green cards who came through the airport have been let into the United States.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

They and other plaintiffs in lawsuits around the country are being offered new visas and the opportunity to come to the United States in exchange for dropping their suits.\n\nVirginia Solicitor General Stuart Raphael said such a piecemeal approach was not sufficient, since it is not clear how many people were turned away at Dulles or other airports. The state had sought to join the suit, saying it impacted many state residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something very troubling about the way this is playing out,\u2019\u2019 Raphael said. \u2018\u2018While I am pleased that they are willing to whisk people back if they come to our attention, they won\u2019t come to our attention if we don\u2019t know who they are.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said, for instance, that Virginia officials have learned that a George Mason University student from Libya is stuck in Turkey due to the ban.\n\nJudge Leonie Brinkema allowed Virginia to join the Aziz brothers\u2019 suit.\n\nNoting that she presided over the case of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, Brinkema said she had never before faced such interest in a legal dispute. Other judges dealing with lawsuits against the order around the country, she said, have told her of similar experiences.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have never had so much public outpouring as I've seen in this case,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018This order touched something in the United States that I've never seen before. It\u2019s amazing.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor the order itself, she had some harsh words, though she said the president has \u2018\u2018almost unfettered\u2019\u2019 power in the realm of borders and national security.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s quite clear that not all the thought went into it that should have gone into it,\u2019\u2019 Brinkema said. \u2018\u2018There has been chaos . . . without any kind of actual hard evidence that there is a need\u2019\u2019 to revoke visas already granted. People had relied on their visas as valid, she said; families had expected to be reunited with loved ones.\n\nBringing back individuals who have sued after failing to get into the country is a good step, she said, but \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s far enough.\u2019\u2019\n\nOutside the courthouse, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said he was \u2018\u2018really pleased the judge recognized real harm is happening in Virginia.\u2019\u2019\n\nBrinkema declined to hold government officials in contempt for the way they handled travelers from the seven banned countries over the weekend, saying she did not know enough Friday to make that determination. Virginia had cited news reports and affidavits from lawmakers that, contrary to an order Brinkema issued last weekend, Customs and Border Protection officers denied immigrants access to lawyers.\n\n\u2018\u2018There were so many lawyers there willing to help, and not a single one got access,\u2019\u2019 Raphael said.\n\nReuveni said that security at Dulles bars lawyers from anything but telephone access to people in screening.\n\nBrinkema said she would expand the order and extend it another week but has not yet released the details.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
