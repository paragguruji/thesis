Those are the six countries whose citizens are banned from entering the United States unless they already have a visa or green card, under Trump\u2019s new order. But the travel ban will not immediately affect doctors already working here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit that comes with having people like doctors immigrate to the US. These doctors are not concentrated in rich parts of the country,\u201d said Mitra Akhtari, one of the project\u2019s leaders, who is pursuing a PhD at Harvard.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Immigrant doctors are often the mainstays of medical care in rural areas, with hospitals providing incentives, such as sponsoring visas or helping the doctors get status as permanent residents.\n\nThe young economists\u2019 analysis, released to coincide with the president\u2019s order, found a high concentration of doctors from the banned countries working in the Rust Belt and Appalachia. Those physicians handle 1.2 million patient visits per year in Michigan; 880,000 in Ohio; 700,000 in Pennsylvania; and 210,000 in West Virginia.\n\nThe five American cities with the highest share of doctors from targeted countries are Toledo and Dayton, Ohio; Detroit; Los Angeles; and Cleveland. The five specialties with the highest percentages of doctors from the six countries are cardiology, pathology, neurology, gastroenterology, and internal medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers estimated that just over 150 doctors from the banned countries work in Greater Boston. Eastern Massachusetts has a relatively low concentration of such doctors.\n\nA recent study in the journal BMJ suggests foreign-born doctors may provide better care than their American counterparts. The study found that older Medicare patients were less likely to die when cared for by foreign-trained internists.\n\nBut the travel ban has put teaching hospitals under pressure to reject medical students from the six nations when selecting residents for post-graduate training, for fear that Trump\u2019s immigration policies will bar the residents from entering the country.\n\nEven as revised Monday, the travel ban will disrupt medical education, according to the American College of Physicians, which represents internists. Fourth-year medical students will learn March 17 which residency program has accepted them and will need to start July 1. Dr. Nitin S. Damle, president of the internists\u2019 group, said the 90-day ban will not leave enough time for students to obtain visas. \u201cEach medical resident treats thousands of patients over the course of a year,\u201d Damle said, calling for an exception for medical residents.\n\nThe economists drew their data from Doximity, an online network with information about virtually every practicing physician in the United States. The students culled the physicians who earned medical degrees in the six countries and looked up the ZIP codes for their workplaces. The researchers limited their count to the 827,522 for whom they could obtain both medical school information and ZIP code.\n\nFour of the 10 people who worked on the analysis are immigrants, Akhtari said. She moved to the United States from Iran when she was 13 and is a naturalized citizen. The students did the analysis on their own, separate from their academic work, as a form of what Akhtari called \u201cdata activism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable to continue to go to protests week after week,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our way of trying to make a difference.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "type": "article"}
