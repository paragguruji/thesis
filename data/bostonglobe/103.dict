Few come from the seven affected countries, but some entrepreneurs worried about the precedent it might set. In addition to high tech and life sciences, foreign-born workers are vital to the construction, hotel, and restaurant industries.\n\nGeneral Electric Co. chief executive Jeff Immelt said in an internal blog post that employees and customers of the global giant in the banned countries are \u201ccritical to our success and they are our friends and partners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe stand with them and will work with the U.S. Administration to strive to find the balance between the need for security and the movement of law abiding people,\u201d Immelt wrote in the post, which the company provided to the Globe. \u201cWe will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue to GE and to the business community overall.\u201d\n\nImmelt is a Republican who is providing input to the administration about how to grow jobs in the manufacturing industry, but he criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Muslims ahead of the election as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that executives at Boston\u2019s largest company by revenue \u201cknow very little right now\u201d about the impact of the order.\n\nSimilar confusion reigned at some US airports over the weekend as several federal courts \u2014 including one in Boston \u2014 issued stays of Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nThat lack of clarity on its own represents a problem for companies, said Christopher Anderson, president of the Massachusetts High Technology Council.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of confusing questions regarding what the new rules are. Green-card holders, are they in or out? Visa holders, are they in or out?\u201d he said. \u201cThe way the White House is implementing this without giving it much thought ... is giving added distractions for global companies in Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. sent a note to employees Sunday saying the company was \u201cactively reviewing our travel policies and controls to help minimize any potential issues for our employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are opposed to any immigration policies and restrictions that target people based solely on their nationality and/or religious faith. Any immigration policy that hinders the diversity of people, faith, or thought hurts this country and our company,\u201d the note read.\n\nPaul English, founder of the travel site Kayak and chief executive of startup vacation booking service Lola, said he recently hired a Mexican national to develop Lola\u2019s app. He said the employee is now worried that if he goes home to visit his family, Trump \u2014 who has spoken harshly of Mexico\u2019s effect on the US economy \u2014 could sign an order preventing him from reentering the nation.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask yourself, what\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d English said.\n\nEven a small number of employees impacted by the executive order could have a big effect, said Mohamad Ali, chief executive of Boston-based Carbonite Inc. Ali said \u201ca small number\u201d of the data-backup company\u2019s 850 employees are from the countries on the list, and none was out of the country when it was implemented.\n\n\u201cThey have relatives [overseas] and it will impact their lives,\u201d said Ali. \u201cThey have now other things to worry about. ... If every company has a small percentage of employees where they now are going to do things differently or less effective, then that affects the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe ban\u2019s impact on Boston\u2019s future workforce is another concern, said Jim Rooney, CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. He worries that if students at the region\u2019s many universities are unable to return to the US from abroad, it will hurt companies\u2019 recruiting.\n\nTodd Dagres, a venture capital executive in Boston, said biotech companies will feel the effects of Trump\u2019s edicts because of the potential impact on students. \u201cThey rely on foreign students, PhDs, to develop their products,\u201d he said.\n\nSteve Kaufer, chief executive of Needham-based TripAdvisor Inc., said he is more concerned with the moral rather than economic implications of Trump\u2019s order. He published a statement on LinkedIn calling the ban \u201cnot only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.\u201d The executive order indefinitely halts entries to the US for Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing the worst global humanitarian crises of our time, and we are against this executive order not just because we are a global business with a diverse workforce, but because we are human beings and citizens who respect and love the fabric of our nation,\u201d he wrote.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
