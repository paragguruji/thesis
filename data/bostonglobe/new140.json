He learned that we have three coequal branches of government: the executive, which is the presidency; the legislative, which consists of the Senate and House of Representatives: and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, with the numerous federal appellate and trial judges. Under our theory of separation of powers, each branch, which is coequal in status, is supposed to check the other.\n\nWhen Alexis de Tocqueville came to America early in our history, he was looking for where sovereignty lay in the new Republic. He was used to the European system under which the king or parliament was sovereign. Here in America, he could not find a single sovereign; instead he discovered the process of sovereignty, entailing our complex system of checks and balances, with the ultimate sovereignty residing in the voters (of which there were very few back then). That is what we learned in high school civics. But after only a month in office, Trump has learned an important lesson that does not get taught in school \u2014 or even in many colleges and universities: Our system of checks and balances extends well beyond the three formal branches of government. It is far more complex and nuanced than we were taught.\n\nLet me catalogue some of the many institutions that now serve as checks and balances, especially on the president. Without a doubt our president is the single most important and powerful player in our government. There is no leader in the free world \u2014 no prime minister, no president, no chancellor, no king \u2014 who has anywhere close to the power that our president can wield through executive orders, vetoes, military actions, and more. But here are some of the institutions \u2014 both formal and informal \u2014 that serve as realistic checks on even this enormous power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe saw in the lawsuits filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota against the president\u2019s executive order on immigration that the states can serve as a check on the power of the president. This would have made Thomas Jefferson happy and Alexander Hamilton sad, but it is a new reality.\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

Holdovers are almost certainly responsible for some of the damaging leaks that have plagued the new administration. They can slow down presidential actions, at least for a while.\n\nAnd speaking of leaks, both the FBI and the CIA, although formally part of the executive branch, can serve as important checks on the White House by selectively leaking damaging intelligence information. Whistle-blowers also serve to check by exposing secrets. Before he became president, Trump praised WikiLeaks for disclosing information that was damaging to Hillary Clinton. Now, as president, he damns these \u201cillegal\u201d leakers.\n\nIntelligence agencies of foreign countries can also serve as checks on our president by threatening and/or disclosing damaging material. One of the reasons given for the firing of General Michael Flynn was the fear of blackmail by Russia.\n\nThen there are the conflicts within the White House itself \u2014 internecine palace warfare \u2014 that result in some members of the administration checking other members of the administration, both within the White House and by selective leaks to the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media \u2014 both traditional and social \u2014 serve as important checks. Those who live by tweets can be checked by tweets.\n\nChurches and religious leaders, in our most religious of Western nations, can check the excesses of presidential power by invoking eternal values. The values can promote both liberal and conservative ideologies.\n\nThe academy, through research, teaching, and advocacy, can serve primarily as a left-wing check on the right-wing tendencies of an administration.\n\nThere are other institutions as well \u2014 ranging from family, to friends, to businesses \u2014 that can check and balance a president.\n\nTrump is learning the hard lesson that in the world we now inhabit there are no perfect secrets. Everyone is listening to and recording everyone else, as General Flynn painfully learned. And he or she who has the recording holds the power to extort or coerce and check.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question is, is this a good or bad thing? It is both. It is good because it sends a powerful message to the most powerful person in the world that even he is subject to multiple checks and balances, that he cannot act with impunity, and that he will be held accountable for his actions, either in the court of public opinion or perhaps in the court of law. It is bad because some of these checking institutions are undemocratic and need to be checked themselves.\n\nSo welcome to the new world of multiple checks and balances. Like democracy itself, it is imperfect but better than its alternatives.\n\nAlan M.
