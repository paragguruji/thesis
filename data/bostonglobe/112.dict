Rainy this morning, tapering off gradually into evening, high 50s to low 60s. But wait'll you see what's coming this week. It's big, yellow, and barely recognizable.\n\nCommuter alert: The Spring commuter rail schedules go into effect next Monday, but you can pick up paper copies starting today at South Station, North Station, and Back Bay. Of course, this being the commuter rail, is the schedule worth the paper it's written on?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you were sleeping: North Korea boasted that it successfully launched a new type of missile over the weekend that could strike the US mainland and Pacific holdings ... The head of the UN World Food Program, speaking to reporters in Geneva this morning, complained that the media focus on Trump means that devastating famines in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are being ignored.\n\nHey, sport: Just when I'm ready to swear off the Sox, they give me another reason to do exactly that. Like yesterday. A 4-hour, 32-minute dreadfest against the Rays that resulted in an injured pitcher (Drew Pomeranz), more players in slumps (Andrew Benintendi), and an ugly loss, 11-2. They're off today, heading out of town.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

They better not be complacent, relying on the fact that every home team has won so far (8 p.m., TNT and 98.5 FM).\n\nPresident Trump heads over to the Capitol this morning to encourage Congress to keep investigating Russia. Wait, that was in my Trump dream last night. Never mind. He's actually going there to speak at the 36th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service. (Side note: here in Massachusetts, state and national flags will be lowered to half-staff in honor of the day.)\n\nLater, he'll have lunch with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed All Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the largest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump plans to name the replacement for fired FBI director James Comey this week after AG Jeff Sessions and deputy AG Rod Rosenstein interviewed eight candidates over the weekend. Dems are hopping mad that Sessions took part, given that the FBI is investigating Russian interference in the election, and the AG pledged to recuse himself from all things Russia. Guess not.\n\nHe's also expected to name Callista Gingrich, wife of Newt, as ambassador to the Vatican soon. But the divorced Newt -- who converted to Catholicism -- won't be able to accompany her to the Communion railing unless he already received annulments of his two previous marriages (yup, Callista is No. 3). Even if he didn't, he still could receive, according to Pope Francis' latest thoughts on the issue, if he engages in spiritual discernment searching for God's will and comes to the conclusion that he can be at peace with God. If there's anybody who would think they could discern God's will, it's Newt Gingrich. What may be more problematic for the Vatican are the two affairs he had during both of his first two marriages. Then again, Catholicism is all about forgiveness. Lucky for him.\n\nThe controversial Trump travel ban Part Deux is in another federal court today, this time in Seattle, where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments on whether to keep the current injunction that halts the ban in place. But there's another 17-month-old case also before the court that could profoundly affect the travel ban decision: Whether the feds violated the rights of Muslims in southern California when they sent undercover informants into mosques. Is one's religion a valid reason to make someone a suspicious person?\n\nCity and state officials gather at 1 p.m. in the Seaport District to announce Boston's latest big hotel: An Omni.\n\nThe UMass Law School in Dartmouth awards its first degrees this morning to 49 students. Commencement speaker is Morris Dees, founder and chief legal officer of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nWatch out if you're a very early or very late commuter over the Sagamore Bridge: The Army Corps of Engineers is doing maintenance and will shut down lanes so there will be just one in each direction from 8 tonight until 5 a.m. Tuesday (rain date is the same period from Tuesday night into Wednesday morning).\n\nLooks like the ransomware cyberattack has been effectively contained. Everyone was worried that when computers fired up this morning for the workweek, more problems would break out. But so far, so good. Well, as good as can be expected.\n\nThis is the week of the \"TV Upfronts,\" which is when the networks pitch their fall shows and schedule lineups to advertisers and reviewers. NBC and Fox are kicking things off today (with the other networks spread out during the week), with NBC getting the jump by telling reporters it's bringing back the \"Must-See TV\" slogan for its Thursday night lineup. That lineup will include the revival of \"Will & Grace\" (with the four originals) and a move for \"This Is Us\" from Tuesday to Thursday in an effort to spread the treacle around.\n\nFinally, another great job on your limericks in honor of National Limerick Day last Friday. Granted, some weren't original, but some were. I must have the most talented subscribers of any newsletter in the universe. And I never exaggerate.\n\nHere's a handful:\n\nDavid Kaufmann:\n\nThere once was a gal from Ontario\n\nWho carried on with an amateur lothario\n\nThis Valentino required no vetting\n\nIn the realm of smooching, hugs, and petting\n\nFor her sighs and coos were beyond compario.\n\nRichard Dunfey, who writes: My dad's fave ... his family owned the Parker House for many years, and I used to live there with him/mom back when the earth's crust was still cooling.\n\nThere once was a lady from Woods Hole,\n\nWho thought she would do something quite droll.\n\nTo a costume ball,\n\nShe wore nothing at all,\n\nShe backed in as a Parker House roll.\n\nDave Petersen:\n\nThere once was a lady named Teresa\n\nWho wrote stories as fine as Linguisa\n\nShe used Capitals and Dashes\n\nThat would flutter your lashes\n\nAnd make you smile just like the Mona Lisa.\n\n(Hate to disappoint you, Dave, but I ain't no lady.)\n\nBeverly Taylor:\n\nThere once was a president named Trump,\n\nWho somebody left at the dump!\n\nHe cried, \"I thought it was trash,\n\nYou can have him for cash.\n\nI've heard he owes millions, maybe billions!\"\n\n(Okay, this one kind of fell apart at the end, but we get the idea.)\n\nBarbara Kunkel of Harrington, Maine:\n\nThere once was a President Trump\n\nWhose ethics were all in his rump.\n\nHe couldn't make Comey\n\nHis personal homey\n\nSo he just took him down to the dump.\n\nI'm sensing a theme here ... more tomorrow.\n\nThanks for reading.
