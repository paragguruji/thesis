It was not clear which countries would be targeted under the new restrictions or exactly how many would be affected.\n\nIn the end, officials said that some of those countries added measures to improve security for passports and to better identify potential terrorist threats. Those countries will not be included in the new restrictions, said the officials, who would not be named describing the policy before its announcement.\n\nOfficials did not say how many countries \u2014 and which countries \u2014 might be affected, insisting the president had yet to make a final decision on how to proceed.\n\nA spokesman from the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss specifics of the agency\u2019s recommendation to the White House, which was delivered in recent days and first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration will ensure that the people who travel to the United States are properly vetted and those that don\u2019t belong here aren\u2019t allowed to enter,\u201d said Jonathan Hoffman, assistant secretary for public affairs at the department.\n\nTrump must still approve the new plan, but it appears to be similar to the kind the president tweeted about a week ago.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher, and more specific,\u201d Trump wrote after a crude bomb exploded on a London Underground train on Sept. 15.\n\nTrump\u2019s original ban blocked all travel to the United States by refugees as well as nationals of seven countries: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Iraq was later deemed to have improved its screening of potential travelers and was taken off the banned list.\n\nThe ban \u2014 put in place just days after the president\u2019s inauguration and without advance notice \u2014 caused chaos at airports around the country and prompted a torrent of criticism from immigrant rights activists, lawmakers in both parties, business executives, academic leaders, and diplomats from around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA furious legal assault on the president\u2019s travel ban delayed its implementation for months, as federal judges agreed with immigrant rights groups that the original ban unconstitutionally targeted a particular religion or exceeded the president\u2019s statutory authority to block immigration.\n\n\u2018The administration will ensure that the people who travel to the United States are properly vetted and those that don\u2019t belong here aren\u2019t allowed to enter.\u2019\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to take effect, with some significant restrictions, while the justices consider the merits of the case.\n\nThe changes to be announced this weekend could have a profound impact on the court case, complicating the review by the justices and potentially making parts of the case moot even before the oral arguments, which are scheduled for Oct. 10.\n\nThe original travel ban included restrictions on the entry into the United States of refugees from around the world. The new rules do not appear to alter the limits on refugees, leaving that question open for the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nThe justices are likely to seek new input from lawyers for the government and for the groups challenging the travel ban before arguments begin.\n\nTrump and his national security officials have argued from the beginning that the travel ban was intended to give the government time to ensure that terrorists are not able to enter the United States using travel documents for people on vacation or seeking temporary employment.\n\nCritics accused the administration of basing threat assessments of travelers solely on the religion of the majority of people who lived in the nations identified by the executive order.\n\nH.R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said Sunday that the president was weighing new restrictions in an effort to keep the American people safe.\n\n\u2018\u2018Well, this is something that we\u2019re looking at, is how to protect the American people better, how to ensure that we know who these people are who are moving,\u2019\u2019 he said in an interview with ABC.\n\nIf \u2018\u2018you can\u2019t screen people effectively to know who\u2019s coming into your country, then you shouldn\u2019t allow people from that country to travel,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "authors": ["Michael D.
