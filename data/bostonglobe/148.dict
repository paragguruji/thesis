Robart earned the ire of President Trump by issuing a temporary restraining order that blocked enforcement of the president\u2019s executive order for a travel ban.\n\nA \u201cso-called\u201d judge?\n\nA \u201cvery, very dishonest\u201d press failing to report on terrorist attacks for insidious reasons of their own, while spreading fake news and polls to fool the public?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm. Now what\u2019s that time-honored political rule?\n\nOh yes: Puppet-string Pinocchio presidents who fib in glass White Houses really shouldn\u2019t throw stones. After all, if there\u2019s anyone who deserves a \u201cso-called\u201d appended to his title, anyone whose morphing mendacities justify the adjective dishonest, it\u2019s one Donald John Trump.\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

Of course, Trump apparently doesn\u2019t believe in any sort of American exceptionalism. As we now know, he sees no moral difference between the country he misleads and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nThe action that occasioned Trump\u2019s denunciatory tweets was the temporary restraining order federal Judge James Robart, appointed by George W. Bush, issued on his travel ban. \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday. On Sunday, he was back on the Twitter attack, writing: \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, considering the deference usually accorded the president in this area, the Trump administration may well prevail in court. Still, there has to be some rational basis for government policy. And given its clumsily cobbled nature, the ban on travel from countries whose entrants have not been responsible for terrorism here, and the confused and chaos-creating way the administration rolled out this executive order, it\u2019s hard to see it as an intelligent response to real-world risk.\n\nIn seeming response to that setback, Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric. On Monday, he claimed the press purposely isn\u2019t covering terror attacks. Perhaps he\u2019s wondering why the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d that Kellyanne Conway told him about \u2014 and no, it wasn\u2019t a mere slip of the tongue \u2014 hasn\u2019t gotten more publicity.\n\nAbout the best possible spin one can put on the early actions of this humbug flea circus of an administration is that Team Trump is laying down markers that will later let him argue he tried to fulfill his absurd campaign promises. (The alternative: that the president is a political Captain Queeg.)\n\nConsider: Even if the courts block his travel ban permanently, the controversial episode will have made Trump look as though he were battling to carry out those commitments. And if part or all of the ban survives the court challenge, Trump could then make a few tweaks in current policy, claim that the big problems have been fixed, and pose as a getting-it-done executive.\n\nThe same is true of his executive order on his border wall. Trump no doubt knows he can\u2019t get Mexico to pay for the wall, but it\u2019s better to push ahead and pretend \u2014 and perhaps have Congress or the courts block him \u2014 than admit it was all so much palaver.\n\nBut though Trump\u2019s easily gulled loyalists may well buy all of that, most of America is now registering its disapproval. And \u2014 mirabile dictu \u2014 Trump\u2019s shameful attacks on the judiciary are even starting to rouse some Republicans not named John McCain, Lindsey Graham, or Susan Collins from their dogmatic slumber.\n\nAnd yet, given what we now know about this peevish, petulant, narcissistic president, a man seemingly incapable of admitting he\u2019s wrong, this is probably going to get a lot worse before it starts to get better.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
