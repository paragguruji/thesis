When he landed in March, he was among the last refugee foster children to make it into the U.S.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tianna Rooney has already bought the poster board for the sign she\u2019ll wave when the 16-year-old refugee boy her family is taking in arrives in the United States. Rooney knows the exact words of welcome she\u2019ll write on it, in the teenager\u2019s native language from the African country of Eritrea.\n\nBut Rooney\u2019s family is leaving the sign blank, for now. She and her husband, Todd, fear actually writing the words \u2018\u2018Welcome Home\u2019\u2019 could break her heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe foster son they\u2019re waiting for is part of a small, three-decade-old U.S. program for so-called unaccompanied refugee minors that has been halted by a series of new refugee bans and travel limits imposed by the Trump administration in the name of fighting terrorism.\n\nBy blocking the program, the U.S. travel bans have stranded more than 100 refugee children who were already matched to waiting American foster families. Without parents or other adult relatives, those kids are living on their own in countries of temporary refuge, in limbo while their U.S. foster parents hope for a court ruling that will allow the children to finish their journeys.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

The children must then pass U.S. security screenings and other requirements, and win a match with an American foster family or group home.\n\nBut a series of Trump administration orders, and court rulings interpreting them, are now barring refugees with no close family in the United States. That requirement shuts out the refugee children in the foster program, who have no relatives they can turn to anywhere.\n\nThe child refugees newly blocked from waiting American foster families include five Ethiopian sisters, ages 9 to 16. The girls lost both parents in 2009, and have faced abuse alone in the war zone of neighboring South Sudan and in Sudanese cities, said Jessica Jones, policy counsel for the Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Along with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Lutherans are one of two U.S. groups running the program on behalf of the U.S. State Department.\n\nOther waiting children include a 17-year-old couple originally from the Asian country of Myanmar and the baby they had together in a refugee camp, after fleeing attacks on their Rohingya religious minority in Myanmar.\n\nIn her home in another Detroit suburb, Sharon Martin, 64, has bought a crib for the young refugee family from Myanmar. But the children\u2019s books she bought, Martin said, are really for her. \u2018\u2018If they come, I can finally read to a child again,\u2019\u2019 Martin says.\n\nRefugee workers say the family faces forced return to Myanmar if their U.S. arrangements fall through.\n\nIn San Francisco, meanwhile, web designer Julie Rajagopal and husband Mike Gougherty, a senior planner for a regional ferry system, are two of the lucky ones.\n\nThe 16-year-old boy they are fostering also fled a lifetime of forced military service in Eritrea, at 13. When he landed in March, a slight youth coming off the plane in an ill-made tracksuit, he was among the last refugee foster children to make it into the U.S.\n\nRajagopal, 35, often had stayed up through the night calling government workers and charity officials in the faraway African hub of Cairo to speed her new foster son\u2019s paperwork.\n\nOn a clear day this summer, the teen strolled with the couple at a park overlooking San Francisco. In the city\u2019s hip Mission District, he blended seamlessly in a red sweater and shoes he carefully matched himself, and jeans he insisted on lovingly ironing with each wear.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brighton, the Rooneys and their 10- and 12-year-old sons stack new socks and T-shirts in the bedroom they\u2019ve set aside for the boy they nicknamed \u2018\u2018Five,\u2019\u2019 meaning the eagerly awaited fifth member of their family.\n\nTianna Rooney recently got out the poster board, thinking to work on the welcome sign. After a concerned look from her husband, she put it away.\n\n\u2018\u2018We want to think positive thoughts\u2019\u2019 that their foster son will come safely, Todd Rooney said. \u2018\u2018But without endangering ourselves. Without setting ourselves up for a heartache.\u2019\u2019", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-30", "type": "article"}
