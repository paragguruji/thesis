But the court said the government should let in travelers and refugees with a \u201cbona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\u201d without fully defining what that meant.\n\nThe administration defined it as immediate family members and in-laws, but not grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles. It also excluded refugees whose only tie to the United States was to the resettlement agency that was working to bring them into the country.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Watson of US District Court in Honolulu disagreed with that interpretation for both refugees and relatives, and the administration appealed to the Ninth Circuit. Justice Department lawyers argued that only parents, children, siblings and in-laws constitute close relatives. But the three judges of the appellate court upheld Watson\u2019s decision on Thursday.\n\n\u201cStated simply, the government does not offer a persuasive explanation for why a mother-in-law is clearly a bona fide relationship, in the Supreme Court\u2019s prior reasoning, but a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or cousin is not,\u201d the 37-page opinion said.\n\nThey also said that working with a resettlement agency meets the standard for a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship with an entity in the United States. Justice Department lawyers argued that a resettlement agency has a relationship with the government, which contracts with the agency to assist refugees, but does not have a formal relationship with the refugees themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said the agency would appeal the decision.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation.\u201d\n\nIn its June order, the Supreme Court rejected parts of earlier rulings by both the judge in Hawaii and the same appeals court.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-07", "type": "article"}
