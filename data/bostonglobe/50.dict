One of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful voices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive Llloyd Blankfein, told employees in a voicemail message Sunday night that the company did not support the new policy, which bars people from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. They include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nIndustry leaders\u2019 worries went beyond immediate efforts to explain the immigration situation to employees and customers, to questions about the future of the country as a magnet for investment and innovation.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Still, investors in neighboring nations are now worried about their ability to travel to the United States, Conway said, as are Muslims working at various companies in which TA invests.\n\n\u201cIt was the process, and the way the decision was made \u2014 emotionally, quickly, impetuously, not particularly well vetted \u2014 that\u2019s got people nervous,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chief executives at the roundtable meeting included Niraj Shah, the chief of online retailer Wayfair Inc., Putnam Investments leader Robert Reynolds, and Dr. David Torchiana, chief of the Boston hospital owner Partners HealthCare, among others.\n\nState Street said it was monitoring the situation closely. The financial giant, with about 32,000 employees, provides custody banking services and manages billions of dollars for pensions and other large investors around the world. It has an office in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, a country not included in the ban.\n\nState Street spokeswoman Anne McNally said it didn\u2019t appear that any of the company\u2019s employees or families had been directly affected.\n\nEven so, she said in a statement, \u201cWhile we appreciate the need for US border security and vigilance, we believe the order as currently stated can have serious negative consequences.\u201d\n\nThe consequences range from cutting off talent entering the country to shaking the confidence of clients and potential investors who have long considered the United States a safe haven. Indeed, executives interviewed Monday seemed to be holding out hope that the popular backlash to the immigration ban, along with the checks and balances of Congress and the courts, would steer the Trump administration to a different course.\n\nBain & Co., a Boston-based consulting firm with 7,000 employees globally, had about 100 people enrolled in a training session in Dubai over the weekend. Only a \u201chandful\u201d were at risk of being affected by the travel ban, said Russ Hagey, a partner and worldwide chief talent officer for the company. But news of the order \u201cdid certainly stir concerns among some of our staff,\u201d he said.\n\nHagey said the overall economic outlook remains positive, citing \u201crising consumer demand.\u2019\u2019 But, he added, \u201cUncertainty here is a risk to growth investment.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
