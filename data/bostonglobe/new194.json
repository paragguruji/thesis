She had wept when he issued the order, because it meant that her mother back home could not get a visa to come to the United States.\n\nAnd that predicament did not change even on Thursday, when Valenti became a US citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI should be able to see my family,\u201d said Valenti, a 35-year-old finance manager, eyes welling with tears, after she took the citizenship oath in Faneuil Hall as her daughter snoozed in a pink blanket nearby. \u201cTrump took that away from me.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

But immigrants say they were stunned that even green card holders \u2014 who are one step away from US citizenship \u2014 were temporarily detained or interrogated at airports from Boston to Los Angeles. On Wednesday, the White House finally clarified that the ban did not apply to green card holders.\n\nTrump\u2019s order blocked visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from the United States for 90 days, halted the entire refugee program for 120 days, and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nIn the chaotic aftermath of his order, nonprofits renewed their calls for eligible immigrants to apply for US citizenship. Nearly 52 percent of the 1 million immigrants in Massachusetts are naturalized citizens, and nonprofits estimate that thousands more are eligible but haven\u2019t applied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe only security from deportation, detention, or exclusion is citizenship,\u201d said Veronica Serrato, executive director of Project Citizenship, a nonprofit near Faneuil Hall that helps immigrants prepare for citizenship.\n\nSerrato said the nonprofit\u2019s telephones rang frequently after Trump\u2019s order, running about 23 calls a day, even more than before the November election, when applications soared. Last year, the group helped over 1,500 people apply for citizenship.\n\nAt the citizenship ceremony Thursday in Faneuil Hall, where revolutionaries, abolitionists, and suffragists once gathered to debate, the crowd was solemn. Typically the mood at citizenship ceremonies is festive, with immigrants waving American flags and joyfully snapping photos.\n\nBut under Trump, immigrants said, they were unsure how to feel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d said Yuly Mosca, a nursing student from Colombia who also became a citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal Judge Patti Saris sought to reassure the new citizens. She quoted lyrics from the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d after former Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, who grew up in the Caribbean. She spoke of the work it had taken to reach this point. She reminded them that the Constitution protects everyone.\n\n\u201cWe as a society cherish civil rights, including the civil rights of new Americans,\u201d she said to loud applause.\n\nWithout mentioning Trump, she urged immigrants to take heart in her own story. Her grandparents arrived from Russia with little money. They did not speak English. But now she is a federal judge.\n\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff Asa Valenti from Iran and her husband Paul checked on their 6-day old baby Amelia after the ceremony.\n\n\u201cSo in the context of the heated rhetoric, I imagine that some of you may have turned on the TV or opened a paper or read a blog and thought about whether the United States remains welcome to immigrants,\u201d Saris said. \u201cLet me assure you, it does.\u201d\n\nHer speech soothed Rana Zerzaba. The 32-year-old civil engineer and mother of two had expected to feel safe in America after fleeing violence in Iraq in 2012.\n\n\u201cEverybody died, every day, every morning,\u201d Zerzaba said. \u201cA lot of people want to feel safe here in the USA. We know the USA is for all people.\u201d\n\nBut she said the apparent targeting of Muslims made her afraid, whether it is wearing her gray hijab on the Red Line from Braintree to Boston or sending her 4-year-old daughter, who is autistic, to preschool.\n\n\u201cI am Muslim, but I am American,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel I am American. I feel no different.\u201d\n\nAfter nine years in the United States, Valenti felt the same mixed feelings after the citizenship ceremony. But she said she has wasted no time putting her new civic skills to work. She has contacted her federal representatives and written letters and was eager to speak to a journalist to tell her story.\n\nHer mother was supposed to apply in person for a visa on Feb. 27 and join Valenti and her husband in their Cambridge apartment in March.\n\nInstead, hours after her baby daughter was born \u2014 named Amelia, for the pilot Amelia Earhart, \u201ca strong woman,\u201d the consular office sent a text message cancelling her appointment. Last year, under President Obama, she received a visa within days.\n\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t get this.\u201d\n\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff Rana Zerzaba from Iraq stood as the judge acknowledged her.\n\nMaria Sacchetti can be reached at maria.sacchetti@globe.com", "authors": ["Maria Sacchetti", "Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["iran", "mother", "ceremony", "trump", "immigrants", "nerves", "faneuil", "united", "trumps", "frayed", "citizenship", "order", "valenti", "flags", "visa"], "summary": "In the chaotic aftermath of his order, nonprofits renewed their calls for eligible immigrants to apply for US citizenship.\nAdvertisement\u201cThe only security from deportation, detention, or exclusion is citizenship,\u201d said Veronica Serrato, executive director of Project Citizenship, a nonprofit near Faneuil Hall that helps immigrants prepare for citizenship.\nAt the citizenship ceremony Thursday in Faneuil Hall, where revolutionaries, abolitionists, and suffragists once gathered to debate, the crowd was solemn.\nBut under Trump, immigrants said, they were unsure how to feel.\nI feel no different.\u201dAfter nine years in the United States, Valenti felt the same mixed feelings after the citizenship ceremony."}
