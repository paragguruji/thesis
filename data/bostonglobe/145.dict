He said the new order was expected next week.\n\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

The new order will almost certainly trigger a fresh round of legal challenges on a topic that has riveted the nation and sparked turmoil around the globe over the past two weeks.\n\nThe original order barred Syrian refugees from the U.S. indefinitely, and blocked for 120 days all refugees fleeing their homelands claiming persecution or fear of violence. No citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen could enter the U.S. for 90 days. A successful court challenge brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota blocked implementation.\n\nKelly stressed that the order was just a pause to look into the vetting process in place in the seven countries in question. The measure will have a \u201cphase-in\u201d mechanism \u201cto make sure that people on the other end don\u2019t get on airplanes,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis again is just a pause, until we look at a number of countries, seven in particular, and look at their vetting processes, how reliable they are -- and I can tell you right now they\u2019re not very reliable -- and find ways to vet in a more reliable way,\u201d Kelly said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-18", "type": "article"}
