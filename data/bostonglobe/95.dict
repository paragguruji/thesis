She was one of the Boston lawyers who persuaded two local federal judges to issue a rare middle-of-the-night restraining order on Trump\u2019s January order.\n\n\u201cWe expect there will not be a crazy impact at all this weekend because the Department of State cable says anyone with a valid visa will not have a visa revoked,\u201d Church said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as crazy as last time, but it\u2019s not going to be simple either.\u201d\n\nThere are no nonstop flights coming in to Boston tonight from the six affected countries of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority. But travelers holding passports from those countries who are arriving from other airports could potentially be affected.\n\nAfter the January executive order \u2014 which also included Iraq \u2014 took effect, chaos ensued in airports across the country, including detentions and protests at Logan. Following the travel ban\u2019s legal block, the Trump administration issued a revised version in March, removing Iraq from the list and exempting green card holders.\n\nThat order was also blocked by federal courts in Maryland and Hawaii. On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed parts of the revised travel ban to go forward and are expected to hear arguments on the scope of the rest of the order in October. The court said the ban could not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a \u201cbona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the State Department defined the terms of a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d\n\nUnder the new set of guidelines, visas that have already been approved will not be revoked. But travelers from the six predominantly Muslim countries would only be eligible for entry and visas to travel to the United States if they can prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or sibling already in the United States.\n\nOther extended familial relationships, including fiancees, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law don\u2019t fit the criteria of \u201cclose family\u201d set forth by the Trump administration.\n\nPartial US travel restrictions go into effect today\n\nThose without bona fide relationships would be barred from entering the country for at least 90 days. Refugees without bona fide relationships would be banned for 120 days.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that most of the folks that are trying to get into the country have a bona fide relationship with a US person,\u201d said Matthew Segal , legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. \u201cThe hope is there will be no drama at the airport. . . . If the government abides by what the Supreme Court says, there won\u2019t be any problems. Those people will be allowed in.\u201d\n\nGreg Romanovsky, chair of the New England Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that local US Customs and Border Protection officials indicated to him that they were still awaiting guidance as of Thursday afternoon on how to handle the travel ban.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to see is going to be business as usual for the airport folks,\u201d Romanovsky said. \u201cThey were really not looking forward to having to verify each person\u2019s \u2018bona fide relationship\u2019 with the United States.\u201d\n\nRomanovsky was among the lawyers and advocates planning at Logan Thursday evening to see how the ban would be implemented.\n\nBoth Church and Segal said they continue to advise people from the affected nations not to travel outside of the United States if they are already here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky situation. Everything is rapidly changing with courts issuing decisions the way they\u2019ve been issuing them,\u201d Church said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
