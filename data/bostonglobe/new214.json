Bannon, President Trump\u2019s grenade-lobbing pugilist of a chief strategist, has a fitting nickname for his West Wing office: \u201cthe war room.\u201d\n\nBut more and more, war is being waged on Bannon himself. And it is unclear how much longer he can survive in his job.\n\nHis isolation inside the White House, after weeks of bitter battle with other senior aides aligned with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, appeared to grow even starker this week after Trump undercut Bannon in an interview and downplayed his role as the Trump campaign\u2019s chief executive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Steve,\u201d Trump told the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin in an interview Tuesday, explaining that Bannon was a latecomer to his presidential campaign. \u201cI am my own strategist,\u201d the president added, a pointed reference to what aides described as his growing irritation that Bannon is receiving credit for being the mastermind behind Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

But it was an unusually public rejection by a chief executive who generally keeps such criticism behind closed doors.\n\nOne person with firsthand knowledge of internal White House dynamics, who asked not to be identified given how tense the situation had become, insisted that no immediate changes were likely. But by openly criticizing Bannon, Trump has created a situation that makes it hard for the swaggering chief strategist to remain in place without appearing deeply undermined.\n\nAllies of Trump\u2019s say he has become more impatient with the infighting \u2014 and the overwhelming attention it is receiving in the media. In a lengthy conversation with Bannon this week, the president repeated his admonition that the chief strategist and his adversaries needed to \u201cknock off\u201d their back-and-forth sniping.\n\nTrump insisted as much in the Post interview, saying, \u201cSteve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will.\u201d His comments in private, people who have spoken with him say, have been more pointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBannon appears to now recognize the peril of his situation and has kept a low profile inside the White House while Kushner has been away with his family. He has told friends and associates, using his trademark military vernacular, that he understands he cannot throw bombs every day and needs to pick his battles carefully.\n\nHe had told several associates over the weekend that he believed that things had cooled off with Kushner. But the comments from the president suggested the truce is uneasy and might not last.\n\nBannon\u2019s allies have already begun discussing a post-White House future for him. Last Friday, Bannon\u2019s main political patron, the financier Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of Robert Mercer, a major Trump donor, holed up in her office at Cambridge Analytica in New York, discussing possibilities for Bannon should he leave, according to two people briefed on the meeting. Bannon served on the board of the data-mining firm until last summer.\n\nThe split between the hard-nosed Bannon and the far more reserved and soft-spoken Kushner has evolved into much more than a personality clash.\n\nFairly or not, Bannon, in the eyes of the president, has become tainted with the new administration\u2019s major losses: the controversial travel ban and the failed effort to pass an Affordable Care Act replacement. He was heavily involved in overseeing the drafting of the travel ban order. He played a limited role in the health care negotiations with congressional leaders but joined them at critical moments, taking a hard-line approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven Bannon\u2019s nature, he has objected to the advice of others inside the administration. Those include not only Kushner and his wife Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, but other advisers who share a similar, more moderate mind-set such as Gary Cohn, the chief economic adviser, and Dina Powell, a deputy national security adviser, most of whom believe the president should ease up on some of his hard-line campaign promises.\n\nBannon\u2019s removal from the White House would not come without political consequences, given his stature on the right. Conservative talk radio has already been abuzz with worry that \u201cthe Democrats,\u201d the epithet they use to describe the Kushner faction in the West Wing, were co-opting the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nStill, Kushner has some powerful allies inside the White House. The person with perhaps the most powerful voice \u2014 Ivanka Trump \u2014 has also soured on Bannon, according to several people familiar with her thinking.", "authors": ["Jeremy W.
