Walsh appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d Tuesday night.\n\nWalsh, a vocal critic of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, chatted with Trevor Noah about the Patriots and the immigration crisis that\u2019s roiling the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoah asked Walsh about why the mayor wants to help undocumented immigrants stay in the country.\n\nWalsh said that with 28 percent of Bostonians being immigrants and 43 percent of residents being first-generation Americans, it\u2019s the proper stance.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

I just think it\u2019s the wrong thing,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Washington \u201ctruly wants to deal with fixing immigration,\u201d Walsh said, then Republicans and Democrats need to come together on reform.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way you do it, not by putting out threats,\u201d Walsh said rebuking Trump\u2019s threats to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take money away from a major city like Boston, and other cities across America, you\u2019re doing damage to the economy and you\u2019re hurting the economy,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nAccording to Walsh, Boston receives about $500 million in federal funding: $100 million goes towards schools, $25 million to public safety, $25 million to other programs, and $280 million goes towards housing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole list of what we have,\u201d Walsh said.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that\u2019s gonna step up, and if you want to work on immigration, that\u2019s fine, do it, but bring in the leaders, the Republicans and Democrats and the Congress and the Senate to come up with some reforms here and some fixing, don\u2019t threaten people,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cTwo days later we come out with a refugee ban, we\u2019re blocking at the airports around America. . . . You can\u2019t stereotype, saying everyone who comes from a Muslim country or from the seven countries on the list is a terrorist. They\u2019re not terrorists. They\u2019re good hard-working people.\u201d\n\nNoah praised Walsh\u2019s stance, calling it a tough position to be in because Walsh hails from one of the few US cities to be struck by terrorism.\n\n\u201cMany people can speak, but very few people actually come from a city where they have been the victims of a terror attack,\u201d Noah said.\n\nAsked what his response would be to people who question how Walsh plans on protecting them, Walsh stated his belief that the key lies in intelligence.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make investments, make investments in TSA, make investments in border patrol, make investments in areas that we keep the bad people out once we throw them out.\n\n\u201cMy police department in Boston, we\u2019re not going to be immigration police,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cHowever, if we find somebody that commits a serious crime, we don\u2019t want them in our city. We\u2019ll get them through our system, and then we\u2019ll deport them, they should be deported.\u201d\n\nWalsh said it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a problem with immigration, mentioning that Congress has failed to act for nearly a decade.\n\n\u201cWe took an oath of office . . . to fix a problem, and that\u2019s what Washington has to do right now,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThey have to stop blaming people, stop changing the topic, stop trying to hide under the diguise of terrorism and undocumented immigration, and really address the issues moving forward.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the segment, Noah congratulated Walsh on the Patriots\u2019 spectacular win at Super Bowl LI.\n\nBringing up the Patriots\u2019 parade, which according to Walsh was attended by about 1 million people, Noah asked, \u201cWhy do people still come out? You\u2019ve won it so many times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cause it\u2019s No. 5 and the whole country hates us and they hate Tom Brady,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThey think he\u2019s really handsome, but they hate him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hate when they\u2019re that good,\u201d Noah said.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked to comment on the Walsh interview by the Boston Herald\u2019s Adriana Cohen. Spicer spoke at the daily briefing about the president\u2019s move to strip funding from sanctuary cities.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the president\u2019s executive order is pretty clear.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a concern about the safety of the American people and how we let people come into this country and, second, with respect to the American taxpayer.\n\n\u201cThe president is going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to Washington\u201d and ensure it is \u201cspent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens,\u201d he said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
