People pouring in. Bad!\u2019\u2019\n\nThe appeals court asked those challenging the ban to file written arguments by 3 a.m. EST Monday, and Justice Department lawyers to reply by 6 p.m. EST. The court could then schedule a hearing, or rule whether the ban should remain on hold.\n\nIn the meantime, people who had been stranded in legal limbo rushed Sunday to fly back to the United States. Some successfully reunited with family members, while others \u2014 particularly those whose visas were physically taken or marked as invalid \u2014 ran into roadblocks trying to board planes overseas.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport in Virginia, immigration lawyers could be heard on phones, arguing with airline representatives to let their passengers board as some seemed confused over the various court rulings and what they meant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal courts in New York, California, and elsewhere have blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented. The lawsuits now range from the District of Columbia to Hawaii.\n\nThe Trump administration has been steadfast in its support of the executive order, which it says is necessary for national security reasons, and the president tweeted his disdain for the judge in Washington state who put a stop to it.\n\n\u2018\u2018The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u2019\u2019 Trump wrote Saturday.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u2018\u2018Meet the Press\u2019\u2019 that White House officials felt Trump was \u2018\u2018operating within his authority as president, both under the Constitution, and under clear statutory law.\u2019\u2019\n\nPence defended Trump\u2019s personal attack on US District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle, who blocked the travel ban nationwide, saying the president\u2019s remarks did not risk undermining the bedrock principle of the separation of powers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s reference on Twitter to the \u201cso-called judge.\u201d Pence said: \u201cWell, look, the president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government. And we have a long tradition of that in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judge\u2019s actions in this case,\u201d Pence added, \u201cmaking decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it\u2019s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country.\u201d\n\nLegal analysts have said the president does have broad authority to set immigration policy, though civil liberties advocates have countered that the order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims, with no real national security purpose.\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to prevail,\u2019\u2019 Pence said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll accomplish the stay and will win the case on the merits. But again, the focus here is on the safety and security of the American people.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Sunday television talk shows, some Republicans in Congress took issue with comments by the president, particularly his description of Robart as a \u2018\u2018so-called judge.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t understand language like that,\u2019\u2019 said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have so-called judges, we don\u2019t have so-called senators, we don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. . . . So, we don\u2019t have any so-called judges, we have real judges.\u2019\u2019\n\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said: \u2018\u2018We all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\u2019\u2019\n\nMcConnell went on to offer a broader critique of Trump\u2019s executive order than he had previously: \u2018\u2018We all want to try to keep terrorists out of the United States. But we can\u2019t shut down travel. We certainly don\u2019t want Muslim allies who have fought with us in countries overseas to not be able to travel to the United States. We need to be careful about this.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile several judges have ruled against the administration\u2019s ban, the case now before the Ninth Circuit is perhaps the most significant one. It stems from a lawsuit by the states of Washington and Minnesota, which alleged the immigration order was \u2018\u2018separating families, harming thousands of the states\u2019 residents, damaging the states\u2019 economies, hurting state-based companies, and undermining both states\u2019 sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.\u2019\u2019\n\nRobart temporarily halted the ban Friday. Then two Ninth Circuit judges, William C. Canby Jr., appointed by Jimmy Carter, and Michelle Taryn Friedland, appointed by Barack Obama, denied the Justice Department\u2019s request on Sunday to immediately restore it.\n\nThe Justice Department could have gone straight to the Supreme Court, but a department spokesman said it would not do so. \u2018\u2018With the fast briefing schedule the appeals court laid out, we do not plan to ask the Supreme Court for an immediate stay but instead let the appeals process play out,\u2019\u2019 spokesman Peter Carr said.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, predicted the matter would be decided by the Supreme Court. \u201cThe president is not a dictator,\u201d Feinstein said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nLeon Fresco, a deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said he was \u2018\u2018surprised that there is this exuberance to immediately rescind the executive order,\u2019\u2019 particularly given the timing issues.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, which barred refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, was temporary. Refugees were banned for 120 days, the others for 90 days, save those from Syria, whose travel to the United States was blocked indefinitely. The order was purportedly designed to give the administration time to formulate a plan for on how to vet those emanating from countries with terrorist activity.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is perplexing why the government wouldn\u2019t want to simply, at this point, maintain an orderly process in one court, as opposed to fighting it out all across the country in different courts, and working its way to the Supreme Court,\u2019\u2019 Fresco said.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s ban were immediately reinstated, that might spark chaos similar to what occurred when it was first rolled out Jan. 27. The State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas. When people began landing at US airports, Customs and Border Protection officers detained more than 100 and deported some, sparking protests and lawsuits.\n\nIt was unclear Sunday whether officials had a plan to avoid a repeat of that outcome, though much would depend on specifically what was ordered by a court, and when.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that, because of Robart\u2019s ruling, it was suspending enforcement of the executive order entirely, and the State Department restored those visas that had been provisionally revoked.\n\nRead the appeals court\u2019s ruling", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "Robert Barnes", "Washington Post"], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["socalled", "judges", "ban", "expects", "court", "order", "house", "president", "united", "department", "trumps", "states", "reinstated", "white"], "summary": "Protesters who object to President Trump\u2019s travel ban held signs Sunday in Hong Kong in front of the US consulate.\nIn the meantime, people who had been stranded in legal limbo rushed Sunday to fly back to the United States.\n\u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have so-called judges, we don\u2019t have so-called senators, we don\u2019t have so-called presidents.\nWe certainly don\u2019t want Muslim allies who have fought with us in countries overseas to not be able to travel to the United States.\nIf Trump\u2019s ban were immediately reinstated, that might spark chaos similar to what occurred when it was first rolled out Jan. 27."}
