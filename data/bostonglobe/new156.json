The legal action was filed against Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, and Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest to tell the story of people with lawful visas attempting to enter the United States only to be turned away, and it comes as the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts argued in a separate lawsuit that the US government has failed to comply with the restraining order. A hearing on the ban is slated for Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsgari\u2019s lawsuit makes the following allegations:\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Epstein Trainee Award for Excellence in Human Genetics Research in October 2015. She had been recruited, the lawsuit said, to work under Soumya Raychaudhuri, a scientist at the Brigham, on a project focusing on tuberculosis.\n\n\u201cIt was hoped that this research would further the collective understanding of translational medicine, and lead to the development of safer and more effective drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nAsgari says she applied for her visa in November, and resigned from her position in a genomics laboratory in Switzerland, arranged to lease her apartment, and on Jan. 25 received confirmation from the US Embassy in Switzerland that her visa had been approved. It was issued Friday, and she made immediate arrangements to fly to Boston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that day, Trump issued an executive order halting all refugees from coming to the United States for four months, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prevented citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Syria \u2014 from entering for three months, even if they had valid visas.\n\nAsgari was not aware of Trump\u2019s order, and on Saturday completed the first leg of her journey to Boston, traveling aboard a Lufthansa Airlines flight from Zurich to Frankfurt.\n\nBut when she arrived at the gate to board a flight from Frankfurt to Boston, she was turned away, according to the lawsuit. A person at the gate who identified himself as a representative of the United States told Asgari she was ineligible to board because of the executive order issued hours earlier. Meanwhile, according to the lawsuit, other travelers with visas were being detained at Logan International Airport.\n\nThe detentions led to an emergency lawsuit filed by immigration lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union. US District Judge Allison Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Judith Dein issued a temporary order preventing the government from detaining or deporting anyone with a valid visa, and they ordered Customs and Border Protection officials to alert airlines that people flying into Logan with valid visas should not be detained or deported.\n\nAsgari, according to the lawsuit, believed she would have been protected by the restraining order, and she booked a new flight direct from Zurich to Boston. She would leave Monday and arrive Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, according to the lawsuit, a Swiss Air Lines representative called her to tell her she would not be permitted to board the flight. Asgari said she tried to explain the restraining order, but had no luck. She arrived at the airport gate anyway, and an airline representative told her she could not board. She showed the judicial order, only to be turned away.\n\nMeanwhile, Asgari\u2019s lawyers in the United States had tried to tell Customs and Border Protection agents she could board the flight, to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe do not read the court\u2019s order to require such action,\u201d a Department of Justice lawyer allegedly told one of the lawyers, according to court documents.\n\nAsgari remains in Switzerland, \u201cunable to commence work at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit asks that she be allowed to enter the United States.\n\nMaria Sacchetti can be reached at maria.sacchetti@globe.com .
