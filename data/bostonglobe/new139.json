O\u2019Malley and included Governor Charlie Baker and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.\n\n\u201cIt is just very important that our people see us sit down at the table as friends,\u201d the cardinal told the group, according to the archdiocese\u2019s official publication, The Pilot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cardinal, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston, expressed support for immigrants and solidarity with the Muslim community, which has been reeling since the announcement last week of executive orders temporarily banning refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Muslim leaders are worried about policies they liken to \u201cMcCarthyism 2.0,\u201d said Yusufi Vali, executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of initiatives, in which the community is painted with broad strokes as one of suspicion, along with Hispanic and Latino communities, are enormously detrimental,\u201d said John Robbins, executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Committee on American-Islamic Relations, who attended the gathering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting, held in a wood-paneled room at the cathedral\u2019s rectory, began with readings from the Bible and the Koran, those who attended said.\n\n\u201cGovernor Baker often meets with community and faith leaders across the Commonwealth and appreciates hearing a diverse range of viewpoints from all communities,\u201d Lizzy Guyton, the governor\u2019s communications director, said in a statement.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order issued Jan. 27 temporarily banned refugees from coming into the country, as well as immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen; all are Muslim majority countries.\n\nThe order had sparked protests across the country, and lawyers for immigrants filed lawsuits in several federal courts, including in Boston, where an emergency restraining order was granted early Sunday morning that stopped the order from being enforced here.\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge will weigh whether to extend the restraining order and will hear other arguments in the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department, in their first filing in response to the Boston challenge of the immigration ban, argued Thursday that there is no need to extend the emergency restraining order, because none of the plaintiffs can claim that the ban is causing them irreparable harm. All of the plaintiffs listed in the ACLU\u2019s suit challenging the ban are in the United States.\n\nThe federal lawyers also laid out the basis of their case: that the executive branch has \u201cbroad power to control the admission of aliens into the United States\u201d and therefore, the plaintiffs are unlikely to ultimately succeed \u2014 one of the standards required for a restraining order. Besides, the lawyers said, the ban is temporary, meaning that the plaintiffs listed in the ACLU\u2019s suit can simply wait until the ban expires before attempting to travel outside the country.\n\nThe Boston case was one of several that civil liberties groups and immigration lawyers filed across the country on behalf of immigrants with permanent legal status or lawful visas who were prevented from entering the country and, in some cases, detained at airports. Other immigrants with lawful visas say they now cannot leave the United States because they would not be allowed to reenter.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ACLU of Massachusetts added six more plaintiffs to the case, including three Iranians who are lawful permanent residents; two Iranian nationals who have been living here on student visas; and Oxfam, a Boston-based international aid organization, which says the president\u2019s order prevents them from bringing employees and associates into the United States to speak to policy makers about the organization\u2019s work in other countries.\n\nOn Thursday, US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, who is overseeing the case, allowed Attorney General Maura Healey to intervene as another plaintiff in the case, on behalf of other residents and institutions in the state who, she argues, are also affected by the ban.\n\nThough similar lawsuits are playing out nationwide, the proceeding in Boston is among the more advanced. In New York on Thursday, a judge extended a restraining order there. Government lawyers said they plan to seek to have the case dismissed, but they had not laid out their arguments as extensively as in the case in Boston.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Gorton granted The Boston Globe\u2019s request to give people electronic access to documents filed in the case. He had earlier barred the posting of the documents on the federal court\u2019s electronic court docket network, as is routinely done in civil and criminal cases in federal courts.\n\nThe Globe argued for traditional public access to the documents because the lawsuit challenging the travel ban raises profound constitutional issues of acute public interest. Gorton agreed.\n\nThe Globe has also asked that Gorton allow the public proceedings in the civil case to be recorded on video, even though cameras are banned in federal courthouses.\n\nBoston was one of 14 courthouses that participated in a pilot program to allow the recording of hearings in civil proceedings. That request has not yet been addressed.\n\nJohn R. Ellement and Lisa Tuite of the Globe staff contributed to this report. Milton Valencia can be reached at Milton.Valencia@\n\nglobe.com .
