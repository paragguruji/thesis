The move came after the Supreme Court partially restored President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that was widely criticized as a ban on Muslims.\n\nVisas that have already been approved will not be revoked, but instructions issued by the State Department Wednesday said that new applicants from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen must prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the United States to be eligible. The same requirement, with some exceptions, holds for would-be refugees from all nations that are still awaiting approval for admission to the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be close relationships, according to the guidelines that were issued in a cable sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates late on Wednesday. The new rules take effect at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday, according to the cable, which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nAs far as business or professional links are concerned, the State Department said a legitimate relationship must be \u2018\u2018formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading\u2019\u2019 the ban. Journalists, students, workers or lecturers who have valid invitations or employment contracts in the U.S. would be exempt from the ban. The exemption does not apply to those who seek a relationship with an American business or educational institution purely for the purpose of avoiding the rules, the cable said. A hotel reservation or car rental contract, even if it was pre-paid, would also not count, it said.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

Dubai-based Emirates said in response to questions on the travel ban Thursday that it \u2018\u2018remains guided by the US Customs and Border Protection on this matter.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe carrier reminded passengers that they \u2018\u2018must possess the appropriate travel documents, including a valid US entry visa, in order to travel.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court partially lifted lower court injunctions against Trump\u2019s executive order that had temporarily banned visas for citizens of the six countries. The justices\u2019 ruling exempted applicants from the ban if they could prove a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with a U.S. person or entity, but the court offered only broad guidelines \u2014 suggesting they would include a relative, job offer or invitation to lecture in the U.S. \u2014 as to how that should be defined.\n\nSenior officials from the departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security had labored since the decision to clarify the ruling and Wednesday\u2019s instructions were the result. The new guidance will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling on the matter. Arguments before the justices will not be held until at least October, so the interim rules will remain in place at least until the fall.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump ordered the refugee ban and a travel ban affecting the six countries, plus Iraq. He said it was needed to protect the U.S. from terrorists, but opponents said it was unfairly harsh and was intended to meet his campaign promise to keep Muslims out of the United States.\n\nAfter a federal judge struck down the bans, Trump signed a revised order intended to overcome legal hurdles. That was also struck down by lower courts, but the Supreme Court\u2019s action Monday partially reinstated it.\n\nThe initial travel ban led to chaos at airports around the world, but because the guidelines exempt previously issued visas, similar problems are not expected. After a judge blocked the original ban, Trump issued a scaled-down order and the court\u2019s action Monday further reduced the number of people who would be covered by it. Also, while the initial order took effect immediately, adding to the confusion, this one was delayed 72 hours after the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nUnder the new rules, would-be immigrants from the six countries who won a coveted visa in the government\u2019s diversity lottery \u2014 a program that randomly awards 50,000 green cards annually to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States \u2014 will also have to prove they have a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with in the U.S. or are eligible for another waiver or face being banned for at least 90 days. That hurdle may be a difficult one for those immigrants to overcome, as many visa lottery winners don\u2019t have relatives in the U.S. or jobs in advance of arriving in the country.\n\nGenerally, winners in the diversity lottery only need prove they were born in an eligible county and have completed high school or have at least two years of work experience in an occupation that requires at least two other years of training or experience.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
