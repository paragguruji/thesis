He said that it is \u2018\u2018entirely possible\u2019\u2019 that dangerous people are now entering the country with the order on hold \u2014 as Trump has said via Twitter \u2014 and that officials might not know about them until it is too late.\n\n\u2018\u2018Not until the boom,\u2019\u2019 he said when asked if he could provide evidence of a dangerous person coming into the country since the ban was suspended.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

That stands somewhat in contrast to Trump\u2019s recent assertion to Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly that the implementation was \u2018\u2018very smooth.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018In retrospect, I should have \u2014 this is all on me, by the way \u2014 I should have delayed it just a bit, so that I could talk to members of Congress, particularly the leadership of committees like this, to prepare them for what was coming, although I think most people would agree that this has been a topic of President Trump certainly during his campaign and during the transition process,\u2019\u2019 Kelly said.\n\nKelly later said, though, that most of the confusion is attributable to court orders and occurred not among Customs and Border Protection officers, but protesters in airports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly\u2019s comments came as a federal appeals court panel was preparing to hear oral arguments on whether Trump\u2019s ban should be reinstated. The hearing marks a critical juncture for the president\u2019s directive, which a lower federal court judge in Washington had ordered suspended last week.\n\nKelly said that he was not criticizing any judge but that their considerations were \u2018\u2018academic\u2019\u2019 and possibly in a \u2018\u2018vacuum.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018I have nothing but respect for our judges, but they live in a different world than I do,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nKelly also cast the Trump directive as a mere \u2018\u2018pause\u2019\u2019 that would allow US officials to assess vetting procedures, and he said they were not contemplating expanding it beyond the seven affected countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nThe opposition to the measure is mounting. On Monday, 10 former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials; nearly 100 Silicon Valley tech companies; more than 280 law professors; a coalition of 16 state or district attorneys general; and a host of civil liberties and other organizations formally lent their support to the legal bid to block Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nThe high-ranking diplomatic and security officials \u2014 among them former secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former CIA director Leon Panetta, former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael V. Hayden \u2014 said there was \u2018\u2018no national security purpose\u2019\u2019 for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018Since September 11, 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order,\u2019\u2019 the group said. \u2018\u2018Very few attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001, have been traced to foreign nationals at all.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe appeals court panel will have to consider whether Trump exceeded his authority and violated the First Amendment and federal immigration law, and whether his order imposes irreparable harm on those it affects. The three judges hearing the matter are William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Obama.\n\nThe states of Washington and Minnesota argued in a filing Monday that reinstating the ban would \u2018\u2018unleash chaos again\u2019\u2019 by \u2018\u2018separating families, stranding our university students and faculty, and barring travel.\u2019\u2019\n\nJustice Department lawyers countered that noncitizens outside the United States have \u2018\u2018no substantive right or basis for judicial review in the denial of a visa at all,\u2019\u2019 and that, at most, the lower court judge should have limited his ruling to \u2018\u2018previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter the appeals court rules, either side can ask the Supreme Court to intervene. The Supreme Court, though, remains one justice short, and many see it as ideologically split 4 to 4. A tie would keep in place whatever the appeals court decides.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
