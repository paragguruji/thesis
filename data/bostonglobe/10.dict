The decision upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii who found the administration\u2019s view too strict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Stated simply, the government does not offer a persuasive explanation for why a mother-in-law is clearly a bona fide relationship, in the Supreme Court\u2019s prior reasoning, but a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or cousin is not,\u2019\u2019 the ruling said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court said in June that President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can be enforced pending arguments scheduled for October. But the justices said it should not apply to visitors who have a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with people or organizations in the U.S., such as close family ties or a job offer.\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

The judge in Hawaii overruled that interpretation, expanding the definition of who can enter the country to the other categories of relatives.\n\nThe Hawaii judge also overruled the government\u2019s assertion that refugees from those countries should be banned even if a resettlement agency in the U.S. had agreed to take them in.\n\nLawyers for the government and the state of Hawaii, which challenged the travel ban, argued the case in Seattle last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeputy assistant attorney general Hashim Mooppan ran into tough questions as soon as he began arguing the government\u2019s case, with Judge Ronald Gould asking him from \u2018\u2018what universe\u2019\u2019 the administration took its position that grandparents don\u2019t constitute a close family relationship.\n\nJudge Richard Paez similarly questioned why an in-law would be allowed in, but not a grandparent.\n\n\u2018\u2018Could you explain to me what\u2019s significantly different between a grandparent and a mother-in-law, father-in-law?\u2019\u2019 Paez asked. \u2018\u2018What is so different about those two categories? One is in and one is out.\u2019\u2019\n\nMooppan conceded that people can have a profound connection to their grandparents and other extended relatives, but from a legal perspective, the administration had to draw the line somewhere to have a workable ban based largely on definitions used in other aspects of immigration law, he said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-09-07", "type": "article"}
