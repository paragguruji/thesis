Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nHere\u2019s a little bit about Robart\u2019s background:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was nominated for a federal judgeship by George W. Bush in 2003 and confirmed by the Senate 99-0 in 2004. At that time, both Senator Ted Kennedy of Mass. and Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont sat on the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sen Orrin Hatch of Utah, the then-Chairman of the committee, said this to Robarts, and judges Juan Sanchez and Diane Sykes, who were also up for confirmation:\n\n\u201cAnd then, you know, the Presidents sometimes put up legislation or put up suggestions or act in executive ways that sometimes are unconstitutional. So it is important to have an honest, decent judiciary to correct those ills. And I am counting on all three of you to be humble, good, honorable, intelligent judges who will help us to have the best, continue to maintain the best judiciary in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nRobarts garnered some national attention in a ruling last year. In a case by the Obama administration against the Seattle police force for using excessive force, Robart said \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the quote:\n\n\u201cAccording to FBI statistics, police shootings resulting in deaths involve 41 percent black people despite being only 20 percent of the population living in those cities. Forty-one percent of the casualties, 20 percent of the population \u2014 black lives matter.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
