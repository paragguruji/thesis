Vayghan initially was sent back to the US after the implementation of President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Travelers from seven majority Muslim nations were speeding to reach the United States on Saturday after a federal judge put a temporary stay on President Trump\u2019s executive order blocking their entry, according to airlines and lawyers.\n\n\u2018\u2018Everybody is rushing to get here,\u2019\u2019 said Shahin Fallah, a lawyer working with visa holders from Iran. \u2018\u2018My sister is a travel agent in Iran. She told me she\u2019s received a lot of calls.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther lawyers said they expect a crush of travelers in the coming days from the affected countries because Trump has promised his administration will challenge the order issued by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday night.\n\nImmigrant advocates said they were encouraging travelers from the seven countries to get on planes as soon as possible, given the uncertainty surrounding the stay.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

No one knows how long the window will last,\u2019\u2019 said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project in New York.\n\nHeller said her group was preparing packets of information that travelers could present to authorities. The documents explain their rights to travel to the United States in case they encounter any problems.\n\nSeveral airlines announced they would allow travelers from the affected nations to board flights after the State Department said Saturday it was restoring visas that had been revoked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAir France, Emirates Airlines, Iberia, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian Airlines, and Etihad Airways, the national carrier of United Arab Emirates, said they would allow passengers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen to board flights to US cities if they had valid documents, according to news agency reports.\n\nSirine Shebaya, a civil rights attorney representing travelers flying into Dulles International Airport, said she had received reports that some travelers were getting on flights. \u2018\u2018People are being allowed to board from Tehran,\u2019\u2019 Shebaya said.\n\nThe Iranian family of 4-month-old Fatemeh Reshad learned that it would be allowed to travel from Dubai to Portland, Ore., so the baby can have open-heart surgery.\n\nShe was in line for a tourist visa, but it was abruptly canceled last week after Trump\u2019s immigration order was announced.\n\nIranian doctors told the child\u2019s parents weeks ago that she needed at least one urgent surgery \u2014 and maybe several \u2014 to correct serious heart defects, or she will die, according to her uncle, Samad Taghizadeh, a US citizen who lives in Portland.\n\nThe International Refugee Assistance Project intervened to get a government waiver for Fatemeh.\n\nAt the international arrivals terminal at Dulles International Airport on Saturday, two people were on hand to greet travelers from the affected countries. Dressed in star-spangled tights and holding welcome signs, Cindy Tomlinson, 44, and her 7-year-old daughter found the terminal quiet.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are both very dismayed about the order,\u2019\u2019 Tomlinson said.\n\nAt John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, lawyers volunteering to help travelers affected by the immigration order were stationed at the arrivals areas of its various terminals.\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re tracking all flights. Those from Asia, the Middle East, or Europe are the ones we\u2019re focusing on,\u2019\u2019 said Camille Mackler, director of legal initiatives for the New York immigration Coalition who is coordinating the legal effort at JFK.\n\nIn addition to monitoring flights, the lawyers also were contacting people who had called the group\u2019s hot line earlier in the week to see if those travelers who were stopped from traveling by Trump\u2019s ban were now making their way to the United States.\n\nLate Friday, a handful of people flew into Los Angeles International Airport from Iran, but none were affected by the ban, said a group of immigration attorneys who had set up a volunteer booth in a terminal to offer free legal services to foreign nationals detained at the airport.\n\n\u2018\u2018The only people that I know of that arrived today were green-card holders from Iran \u2014 they were all very expeditiously passed through,\u2019\u2019 said Alanna Holt, an immigration attorney from Los Angeles.\n\n\u2018\u2018They are rolling out the red carpet for them today because of everything that\u2019s happened,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHowever, Customs and Border Protection officials on Friday night did detain several travelers arriving from other countries.\n\nDetainees included a green-card carrying Afghan family with young children that was held for over five hours. Authorities also held a 23-year-old woman from Ukraine.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
