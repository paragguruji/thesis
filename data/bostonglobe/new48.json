If the appeals court reinstated Trump\u2019s ban, the states said, the \u2018\u2018ruling would reinstitute those harms, separating families, stranding our university students and faculty, and barring travel.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe technology industry also has weighed in against the ban, contending it would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees. Tech giants like Apple and Google, along with Uber, filed their arguments with the court late Sunday.\n\nThe next opportunity for Trump\u2019s team to argue in favor of the ban will come in the form of a response to the Washington state and Minnesota filings. The 9th Circuit ordered the Justice Department to file its briefs by 6 p.m. Monday. It had already turned down a Justice request to set aside immediately the Seattle judge\u2019s ruling, which put a temporary hold on the ban nationwide.\n\nThe government had told the appeals court that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, an assertion that appeared to invoke the wider battle to come over illegal immigration.\n\nCongress \u2018\u2018vests complete discretion\u2019\u2019 in the president to impose conditions on entry of foreigners to the United States, and that power is \u2018\u2018largely immune from judicial control,\u2019\u2019 according to the government.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, predicted the appeals court would not have the last word. \u2018\u2018I have no doubt that it will go to the Supreme Court, and probably some judgments will be made whether this president has exceed his authority or not,\u2019\u2019 she said on Fox News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 Muslim-majority countries that the administration said raise terrorism concerns. The State Department said last week that as many as 60,000 foreigners from those seven countries had had their visas canceled. After the decision by the Seattle judge, the department reversed course and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had valid visas.\n\nThe department also advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order would now be allowed in.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump\u2019s order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \u2018\u2018suspended any and all actions\u2019\u2019 related to putting in place Trump\u2019s order.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "john", "ban", "appeals", "state", "court", "order", "minnesota", "secretary", "trumps", "president", "opposition", "states", "expresses", "department", "kerry"], "summary": "Former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright have joined former national security officials under President Obama in a statement opposing President Donald J.
