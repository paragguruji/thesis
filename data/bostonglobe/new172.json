And in the long term, academics said, Trump\u2019s ban will hamper their research and hurt the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly ill-judged and likely counterproductive,\u201d said Richard Lester, a professor and associate provost for international activities at MIT, who attended the pre-rally gathering Sunday. \u201cOur community is here because they are contributing research and new knowledge creation that benefits this country.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

It is integral to all we do,\u201d Faust wrote, noting that nearly half of the university\u2019s deans are immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1,500-word letter also said the university will hire its first Muslim chaplain at Memorial Church.\n\nThere are about one million international students in the United States, including a combined 17,354 from the countries affected by the ban, according to the latest data from the Institute of International Education, from the 2015-16 academic year.\n\nThere are 59,000 international students in Massachusetts, the majority from China, India, South Korea, Canada, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne official who works at the Department of Homeland Security in New England said attempts to get information from the agency\u2019s top officials had been challenging, making it hard to provide answers to those affected.\n\n\u201cThis is not who we are, this is not what we signed up to do, and this is not the United States,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because officials have been told not to speak with the news media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least two MIT students, one from Iran and one from Syria, were not allowed into the United States when they tried to travel back to campus Saturday, campus officials said. Doctoral student Tiziana Smith, who studies civil and environmental engineering, said one of her Iranian classmates made it back just in time.\n\n\u201cIf she had just come back two days later, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to come back,\u201d said Smith, on her way to the Copley Square rally with a sign that said \u201cNo ban. No wall.\u201d\n\nBeyond their lab mates and colleagues, professors worried the ban will hamper the academic community\u2019s ability to attract talent from abroad and discourage researchers in the United States from traveling abroad.\n\nAt MIT, 43 percent of faculty are internationally born and 42 percent of graduate students are international. To illustrate the diversity, one MIT researcher said that in her lab of 30 people, only three are US citizens. Three have Iranian passports.\n\nAt Harvard, Iranian doctoral student Mitra Akhtari said the past two days were among the worst in her life. Akhtari said she and her family came to the United States from Iran in 2001, six months before the 9/11 attacks. She is now a US citizen.\n\n\u201cWe faced a lot of discrimination. We were called terrorists. But nothing, honestly, hurt as much as the last two days,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not by individuals. This is by institutions of the United States.\u201d\n\nAkhtari said she was heartened by the support she said she and other Iranians received from the Economics Department chairman, David Laibson, who urged the department to attend the rally Sunday.\n\nOther Boston-area students have not been allowed back into the United States, including Behnam Partopour, an Iranian fourth-year PhD student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\n\nPartopour said he lived in Worcester for three years, working as a research assistant at WPI before he left for Germany last summer for a research project. He then returned to Iran to wait for his US visa and had a plane ticket to return to the United States this week.\n\nNow he doubts he will be able to board the plane. Several other Iranian students told the Globe Sunday that they were barred from boarding flights to the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried because I don\u2019t know when I would be able to see people who I love again. I just want to go back and continue my work,\u201d Partopour said in an e-mail Sunday.\n\nTwo Iranian professors at UMass Dartmouth who had flown to Paris for an academic conference were detained Saturday at Logan Airport but released three hours later, after an intervention by lawyers.\n\nOnce they were safely home, the university released a stern statement denouncing the ban.\n\n\u201cWe want to be clear that we believe the executive order does nothing to make our country safer and represents a shameful ignorance of and indifference to the values that have traditionally made America a beacon of liberty and hope,\u201d wrote UMass Dartmouth\u2019s interim chancellor, Peyton R. Helm, and provost Mohammad Karim.\n\nA UMass spokesman said the five-campus system has other faculty and students abroad but is not sure whether they will be affected when they attempt to reenter the country.\n\nAt MIT, the lobby of Building 7 cleared out quickly after the crowd headed to Sunday\u2019s rally. In wandered a professor who came late.\n\nDrazen Prelec, who teaches economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said the least the president could have done was give warning so professors could have planned their travel accordingly.\n\n\u201cThere is really no silver lining here,\u201d he said.\n\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com .
