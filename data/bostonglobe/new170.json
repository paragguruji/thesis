Massachusetts could be hit particularly hard because the state is home to some of the world\u2019s leading teaching hospitals as well as smaller community hospitals that typically depend on a large pool of foreign medical talent.\n\nThe concern over Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 particularly his restriction on travel from seven majority Muslim countries \u2014 has added an unusual amount of anxiety to the upcoming \u201cMatch Day,\u2019\u2019 when medical students learn which hospital has accepted them to a residency program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how programs are going to react, and it\u2019s part of why everybody is very stressed and very on edge right now,\u201d said Kelly Thibert, president of the American Medical Student Association.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Pinsky, chief executive of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a nonprofit responsible for vetting international medical students. \u201cBut, frankly, it\u2019s very pragmatic from a program director\u2019s perspective and their concern about patient care.\u201d\n\nDr. Darrell G. Kirch, chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said \u201chospitals are being given an impossible choice\u201d between hiring the best candidates, regardless of nationality, and ensuring they have residents ready to care for patients in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis has served our country so well,\u201d he said of the system used to funnel foreign medical graduates into the United States, \u201cand it\u2019s a tragedy that it\u2019s being disrupted by uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know national security is a priority, but I think health security \u2014 having the best physicians possible \u2014 is also part of our security as a nation,\u201d Kirch said.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 licensed physicians in the United States who graduated from medical schools in the seven countries listed in Trump\u2019s executive order, according to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Many work in poor rural and urban areas, under a federal program that lets foreign doctors remain in the country if they provide care in underserved communities.\n\nOverall, nearly 1 in 5 physicians in the United States is foreign born, an influx that has helped the nation cope with a doctor shortage, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration order was suspended by a federal court, and he has said he will propose a new policy this week. His administration has not given any indication that it intends to carve out a waiver for medical students as part of the new policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctors said Trump\u2019s initial order, issued Jan. 27, has already cast a shadow over the highly competitive system used to vet 20,000 foreign medical students based on test scores, interviews, and recommendation letters.\n\nUnder the system, hospitals submit lists of their preferred candidates, and medical students submit lists of the hospitals where they want to work. Both have until Wednesday to finalize their preferences.\n\nThen a nonprofit group, The National Resident Matching Program, uses an algorithm to pair the two groups, and announces the results on \u201cMatch Day,\u201d March 17. Residents typically work for thee years in a hospital, logging 75 to 80 hours a week, often on the overnight shift.\n\nMedical residents from abroad will need to quickly obtain visas to enter the country, adding to the pressure on hospitals to discount them during the application process.\n\nDr. Jatin M. Vyas, who directs the internal medicine residency program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said he received 3,700 applications for 45 residency positions this year. About 250 medical graduates were interviewed, and his final list of candidates, he said, includes one doctor from Iran and one from Iraq \u2014 two countries named in Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position where we\u2019re willing to take the risk right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are simply looking for the best talent.\u201d\n\nBut the order is not only affecting students from the seven countries, Vyas said.\n\nMedical school students from India, Pakistan, and Canada have been e-mailing him, he said, to urge him not to rank them lower because they are not coming from Trump\u2019s list of targeted countries.\n\n\u201cWhat that has told me is there a lot of students who are very worried that they may not be able to train\u201d in the United States, Vyas said.\n\nDr. Michael F. Collins, chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said he is hoping that hospitals do not penalize qualified foreign medical graduates, given how much they contribute to the country.\n\n\u201cIt seems a shame to me that students who have completed their studies and done their work and are attractive applicants would not be listed because of an uncertainty cast by the executive order,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it would seem a shame to me that the next Nobel Prize winner wouldn\u2019t be offered a spot because of this order.\u201d\n\nMichael Levenson can be reached at michael.levenson@globe.com.", "authors": ["Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-02-21", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["executive", "foreign", "trump", "reject", "medical", "hospitals", "hospital", "united", "trumps", "pressure", "work", "feel", "order", "students", "policy"], "summary": "Hospitals are under intense pressure to reject qualified international medical students applying for residencies in the United States because of fears that President Trump\u2019s immigration policies may bar the students from entering the country, educators and hospital administrators say.\nMassachusetts could be hit particularly hard because the state is home to some of the world\u2019s leading teaching hospitals as well as smaller community hospitals that typically depend on a large pool of foreign medical talent.\nTrump\u2019s immigration order was suspended by a federal court, and he has said he will propose a new policy this week.\nHis administration has not given any indication that it intends to carve out a waiver for medical students as part of the new policy.\nUnder the system, hospitals submit lists of their preferred candidates, and medical students submit lists of the hospitals where they want to work."}
