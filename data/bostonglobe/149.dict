As a fig leaf, he also threw in North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 nations that are not majority Muslim but hardly founts of travel to America \u2014 trumpeting his resolve to foil terrorism.\n\nThis fools no one beyond his most fervent followers. Bereft of domestic successes, Trump seeks to assuage his base by embracing an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy drenched in xenophobia. In the past weeks, Trump has affirmed his indifference to democracy and people beyond our shores, embracing legislation that sharply limits legal immigration; entertaining a further choke hold on admitting immigrants; renouncing our commitment to humanitarian ideals abroad; and rejecting pleas to help refugees from war and bloodshed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a tragedy for countless others \u2014 and for us. Without surcease, Trump is attacking that which defines America at its best: its identity as advocate for democracy and refuge for the oppressed.\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have now discarded democracy and human rights as pillars of American foreign policy. Such sentiments, they assert, impede America in pursuing its self-interest. Their message to the subjugated and endangered is stark: Unless it serves Trump\u2019s transactional worldview, their plight \u2014 no matter how miserable \u2014 does not concern us.\n\nGet Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: From the Globe's must-read columnist, an extra offering each week of opinion and ideas.

But no president before Trump has rejected them outright. Repeatedly, he is most drawn to autocracy and autocrats, including the dictatorial and murderous Vladimir Putin \u2014 about whose interference in our own democracy Trumps remains silent.\n\nBlind to history and oblivious to strategy, Trump\u2019s myopic machismo endangers America\u2019s security. In a dangerous world our most willing and reliable allies have always been democracies that honor human rights: They have joined our military and diplomatic coalitions, shared intelligence in the struggle against terrorism, helped us subdue pandemics, and served as our closest trading partners.\n\nIn contrast, the violent extremism we fight together thrives where repression and corruption flourish. Uncritically supporting autocrats stokes anti-Americanism, squandering our moral capital and diminishing our influence on repressive regimes that breed aggression, instability, and human suffering. Our burgeoning global unpopularity does not evince Trump\u2019s strength, but his foolishness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNor does espousing human rights mean imposing American values. Throughout history, brave men and women have risked everything in the hope of securing those same rights. Nelson Mandela was not promoting America\u2019s agenda; he suffered imprisonment so that black South Africans would suffer no more. Our shame lies in how long we failed to support him.\n\nWe must not let Trump shame us now. Thus we must also defend another hallmark of our better selves: America\u2019s historic role as refuge for the endangered and oppressed.\n\nTrump\u2019s renewed Muslim ban is a cynical effort to placate his base. Most appalling is his indefinite ban on refugees from Syria\u2019s slaughterhouse, a genocidal horror that condemns hundreds of thousands of civilians to death, hunger, trauma, and catastrophic injury. To all this Donald Trump\u2019s America has turned its back.\n\nBut not just on Muslims \u2014 or Syrians. As Trump regaled its General Assembly with threats to North Korea\u2019s leader, the United Nations continued imploring the world to shelter 1.2 million refugees from conflict and persecution. But Trump told the General Assembly that he wants to prevent refugees from resettling in the United States. He supports legislation to cut legal immigration by half, and proposes capping refugee admissions at 45,000 per year, a far cry from Barack Obama\u2019s goal of 110,000. Meanwhile Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s chief adviser on immigration, is urging a ceiling of 15,000 \u2014 roughly half the number of refugees created each day \u2014 subordinating humanitarian urgency to Trump\u2019s nativist agenda.\n\nThis is morally inexcusable. Those whom Trump shuns include children bereft of family, and survivors of rape, torture, and religious persecution. Contrary to his assertions, our vetting program for refugees is stringent and safe.\n\nCountries that shelter these refugees \u2014 severely straining their resources \u2014 include those, like Jordan, critical to regions where we deploy American troops and seek to counter terrorism. Our willingness to emulate them enhances our national security by affirming America\u2019s own humanitarian commitment. Beyond that, it is imperative to welcome those \u2014 including Muslims \u2013 who risked their lives to oppose terrorism and assist American efforts. Here compassion and self-interest converge.\n\nOur openness to the oppressed tells the world that we are worthy of emulation, not enmity. Our strength derives not merely from those who are Americans by accident of birth, but from those who made a free and cherished choice. Trump\u2019s rhetoric notwithstanding, our economy grows with their help \u2014 as confirmed by a study from the Department of Health and Human Services that the administration rejected.\n\nWe cannot let him redefine the world\u2019s richest country by his poverty of spirit.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-10-02", "type": "article"}
