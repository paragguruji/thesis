It helps them in their life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Emami, who holds an Iranian passport, says the project is in jeopardy after President Trump signed an executive order in late January to temporarily ban people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. As the battle over the travel ban works its way through court appeals, she finds herself among a cohort of foreign-born artists in Boston who say their work and lives could be significantly disrupted by the travel ban, which \u2014 if upheld \u2014 could bar them from returning to the United States if they left for work or to visit family. The ban was temporarily suspended after a Friday ruling by US District Judge James Robart.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Emami, a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Iran this summer to continue the project, so all my plans are, I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re nowhere. I don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

I have a business to run. I am not prepared to be exposed to bad treatment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMFA director Matthew Teitelbaum said that the uncertainty created by the ban raised the \u201cchilling notion\u201d that some arts organizations may alter the sort of programming they\u2019re willing to offer.\n\n\u201cMaybe some institutions will just avoid doing certain kinds of programming, or not engage in certain conversations because the uncertainty is too great from a planning point of view,\u201d said Teitelbaum. \u201cThat will be truly disappointing, and in the end it will be a great loss for the cultural diversity we stand for.\u201d\n\nArtsEmerson, which often presents the work of international theater troupes, including artists from the Middle East, is still studying how the ban could affect the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very confused moment,\u201d said David Dower, co-artistic director of ArtsEmerson. \u201cWhen we\u2019re presenting international [acts], we have to go through the immigration system. . . . It\u2019s already been challenging, and now it\u2019s going to be more challenging.\u201d\n\nHe added that ArtsEmerson was currently considering two pieces for the 2017-18 season that involve artists from the affected countries.\n\n\u201cUnless [the ban] is rescinded, or expires outright, we cannot do those,\u201d Dower said in a follow-up e-mail. \u201cBut just as influentially, not knowing the realities for those artists and shows NOW means we would be having to risk losing the shows down the line.\u201d\n\nInstitute of Contemporary Art director Jill Medvedow said that although the travel ban does not affect any public programming scheduled at the ICA over the next few months, she was \u201cconcerned that site visits and planning could be impacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt and learning have no borders,\u201d Medvedow said in a statement to the Globe. \u201cOur work depends greatly on the exchange of scholarship and ideas from around the world.\u201d\n\nFor some foreign-born local artists, the ban could affect not only their chances to work internationally, but also their ability to stay in the United States once their visas expire. Emami, whose visa is set to expire after she graduates this May, said she\u2019s been working on an application for a new visa since September.\n\n\u201cMy attorney tells me that everything is on hold and we can\u2019t go forward for three months,\u201d said Emami. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get another visa, then I\u2019ll have to leave the country.\u201d\n\nRoya Amigh, a mixed-media artist from Iran, said she has received similar advice from her attorney.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what my plan is,\u201d said Amigh, who was in the middle of applying for a new visa when Trump signed the order. Amigh, who graduated with an MFA from Boston University in 2012 and has had solo shows in Boston, said the ban has thrown into question whether she\u2019ll be able to travel for an upcoming international show. But that anxiety pales beside her fear at being forced to leave the United States.\n\n\u201cThat would be a disaster,\u201d said Amigh, who also teaches at Brookline\u2019s Michael Driscoll School. \u201cIf I go back to Iran I don\u2019t know what will happen to me. I don\u2019t know what will happen to my career.\u201d\n\nAmigh\u2019s situation is familiar to Farzaneh and Bahareh Safarani, twin Iranian sisters who received MFAs last year from Northeastern University. The Safaranis, multimedia artists who\u2019ve had solo shows in Boston and Iran, say they are filing paperwork to have their visa applications expedited, but are also exploring other options.\n\n\u201cWe are applying to every program in London or Canada for PhD programs,\u201d said Farzaneh, who, along with her sister, has a visa that expires in May. \u201cWe\u2019d have to start our lives again.\u201d\n\nEmami, who said she\u2019s been thrilled with the expressive freedom she\u2019s found in the United States, said she now felt trapped.\n\n\u201cI came here and I thought, this is my chance,\u201d said Emami. But \u201cif my family cannot come to visit me. If I cannot go back to continue my project. I feel like I\u2019m in a prison, but I came here for freedom.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
