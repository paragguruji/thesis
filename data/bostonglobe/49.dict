It said the travel ban was intended \u2018\u2018to permit an orderly review and revision of screening procedures to ensure that adequate standards are in place to protect against terrorist attacks.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrial judges around the country, including in Boston, have blocked aspects of Trump\u2019s executive order suspending travel from seven mostly Muslim countries and limiting the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump. That ruling, from Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, blocked the key parts of Trump\u2019s order. Robart\u2019s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred to enter the United States, and it inspired an attack from Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security.\n\nOn Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Robart\u2019s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs. The court declined, instead asking for more briefs.\n\nThe appeals court\u2019s order Saturday night was issued by Judge William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by Barack Obama. The third judge on the panel, Judge Richard R. Clifton, was appointed by George W. Bush.\n\nNow that the requested briefs have been filed, a ruling from the appeals court should follow soon. It will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe two states\u2019 appellate brief, filed early Monday, said Trump \u201cunleashed chaos by signing the executive order.\u201d\n\nOther states have joined the fray. Hawaii, which had filed a separate lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s order, moved to intervene Sunday. The next day, 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a brief supporting Washington and Minnesota. Massachusetts was among them, along with California, New York, and Virginia.\n\n\u201cIf this court were to grant a stay,\u201d the supporting brief said, \u201cit would resurrect the chaos experienced in our airports beginning on the weekend of Jan. 28 and 29, and cause harm to the states \u2014 including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201d\n\nIn a brief filed Saturday, the administration argued Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security.\n\nIn response, lawyers for the two states said that was not plausible, as it would mean that the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, it could prove difficult to find the necessary five votes at the Supreme Court to undo a lower court order; the Supreme Court has been at less than full strength since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death a year ago. The last immigration case that reached the justices ended in a 4-to-4 tie.\n\nBut the travel ban expires in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before a higher court takes up the issue. The administration could change it in any number of ways that would keep the issue alive.\n\nThe Supreme Court bench also could be full, with a new ninth justice on board, by the time the court is ready to hear arguments. If Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s nominee for the court, is confirmed this spring chances of a tie vote would disappear.\n\nOn Saturday, the administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious bias, even though Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the administration\u2019s brief said, would violate the separation of powers.\n\nWashington and Minnesota said \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201d\n\nThey added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it won\u2019t enforce that part of the order.\n\nQuestions about permanent residents are not moot, the states said; the administration could again change positions.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey joined a coalition of 16 attorneys general in filing a brief in San Francisco opposing the immigration ban. The attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia argued Trump\u2019s order would have an adverse effect on the states as well as the interests of each state\u2019s residents and institutions, such as universities and businesses whose students and employees would be affected. \u201cWe now all stand together in facing concrete, immediate, and irreparable harms from the executive order,\u201d the states argued.\n\nHealey said Monday that \u201cno president or administration is more powerful than our laws and our Constitution. As state [attorneys general], it is our job to hold this administration accountable and stand for the interests of our states and our residents.\u201d\n\nSeveral former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration against the ban Monday, including John Kerry, secretary of state under Obama, and Madeleine Albright, who had the position in the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cWe view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d the declaration said.\n\nAfter the Seattle court ruling, the State Department said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 could travel to the United States if they had valid visas.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
