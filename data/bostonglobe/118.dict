Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditional signatories included Brown president Christina Paxson, Dartmouth president Philip J. Hanlon, Tufts president Anthony P. Monaco, and Brandeis president Ron Liebowitz.\n\nThe higher education leaders said Trump\u2019s order \u201cspecifically prevents talented, law-abiding students and scholars from the affected regions from reaching our campuses. American higher education has benefited tremendously from this country\u2019s long history of embracing immigrants from around the world.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

We welcome outstanding Muslim students and scholars from the United States and abroad, including the many who come from the seven affected countries.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has faced a strong backlash from the order, which has prompted lawsuits and widespread protests across the country since it took effect on Jan. 27.\n\nIt halted all refugees from coming to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prevented citizens of seven majority Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Syria \u2014 from entering for 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has defended the order as a necessary measure to protect the nation from terrorism, saying in a recent statement that \u201cwe will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border.\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s letter, the college presidents said they understood the need to protect national security.\n\n\u201cThe vetting procedures already in place are rigorous,\u201d they wrote. \u201cImprovements to them should be based on evidence, calibrated to real risks, and consistent with constitutional principle. Throughout its history America has been a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom in the world. ... This executive order is dimming the lamp of liberty and staining the country\u2019s reputation. We respectfully urge you to rectify the damage done by this order.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "type": "article"}
