But he was unable to fly back to Boston when President Trump suddenly banned travel from Iran and six other predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe experience shook Hosseini, making him feel as though the instability he had left behind in Iran was taking root in the country he had revered as the preeminent place to do graduate studies.\n\n\u201cNow, I cannot plan for my future in the United States,\u201d said Hosseini, who is 26 and back in Amherst after the order was temporarily lifted by a judge. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem for me and, at this moment, I don\u2019t know if I can bring my wife here or not.\u201d\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

But it has also ensnared a highly educated community of Iranian scholars, researchers, and professionals who, over the last century of immigration, have risen to the top echelons of Boston\u2019s academic, health care, and high-tech institutions.\n\nMany were drawn by the promise of greater social and political freedom and better access to labs and technical equipment. They are the kinds of immigrants that politicians of both parties generally say they want to encourage. Most come here legally and ultimately work in science, engineering, and mathematics, fields that are integral to the economic health of the country.\n\nNow, many question whether to remain in the United States or take their skills elsewhere, raising the specter of an exodus from some of the state\u2019s leading universities and medical centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey love America,\u201d said Pardis Sabeti, an Iranian-born Harvard professor of evolutionary biology and immunology who has five students of Persian heritage working in her infectious disease lab. \u201cBut this changes the relationship. They\u2019re wondering: Does America love you back?\u201d\n\nIranians have a long tradition of studying in the West, beginning in the 19th century, when many attended European universities, said Steven Ditto, the author of a report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on the Iranian quest for US education.\n\nThe tide shifted to America in the 1960s and \u201970s, as growing Iranian oil revenues and a Cold War defense relationship with the United States brought more students to this country, Ditto said.\n\nBy 1975, Iranians comprised the largest group of foreign students in the United States, he said. The 1979 Islamic Revolution slowed the influx, but the numbers have increased gradually over the past several years.\n\nAs of November, 14,200 Iranians were studying at US colleges, including about 660 in Massachusetts, making the state the fourth-largest home to Iranian students, behind California, Texas and New York, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMore than 80 percent study at the graduate level, the highest percentage of any country that sends students to the United States, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nMore than 75 percent study science, technology, and engineering, also the highest percentage of any group of foreign students. National Science Foundation surveys suggest 89 percent plan to remain after graduation, the highest \u201cstay rate\u201d of any country.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else,\u201d said Siavash Zamirpour, a 19-year-old Harvard freshman and US citizen who plans to become a doctor like his father, an orthopedic surgeon who emigrated to Houston 15 years ago. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to feel welcome in a country if the official stance is, we don\u2019t really want people from that country coming into the US.\u201d\n\nDitto predicted the ban will not deter Iranians from enrolling in American universities, just as they have through sanctions, nuclear tensions, and the 2009 protests that demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe staff Mohsen Hosseini was a PhD student in electrical engineering at Umass Amherst who was unable to return to the US after going back home to Iran for his wedding.\n\n\u201cThese people ostensibly have been living under a religious autocracy for 25-plus years, so they have a sense of being patient and seeing things through,\u201d he said.\n\nIranians are also used to waiting for visas because the country is classified by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, Ditto said.\n\n\u201cIranian students are already subjected to the most stringent tools the government has, in terms of checking who they are and what their research interests are,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump argues his travel ban will stop \u201cpotential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart.\u201d But between 1975 and 2015, no Americans have been killed by acts of terrorism committed on US soil by citizens of Iran or the six other countries affected by his order, according to the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely disheartening to have your identity be the only definer of your character and have that be denigrated and debased at such a high level,\u201d said Kian Sani, a 20-year-old Harvard junior whose father is Iranian. \u201cMy life goal, now more than ever, is to educate others about the rich culture Iran has to offer, how friendly we are, and how welcoming we are.\u201d\n\nHouchang E. Chehabi , an Iranian-born professor at Boston University who came to the United States in the 1970s to get a doctorate in political science at Yale, took a more pessimistic view. He predicted fewer Iranians will come to this country if they sense Trump may take further steps to clamp down on them and others from majority Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a general sense of being singled out, which is all the more painful in that we\u2019ve done so well in this country,\u201d Chehabi said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a general sense of anxiety.
