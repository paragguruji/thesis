Dinner at Shojo in Chinatown or Erbaluce in Bay Village was also off the table. Throughout the area \u2014 and the nation \u2014 restaurants closed in solidarity with striking workers on a Thursday declared a \u201cDay Without Immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe strikes and closures underscored the importance of immigrants in the restaurant industry. Nearly a quarter of all people employed by restaurants are foreign-born, and about 30 percent of businesses in the restaurant and hotel sector are immigrant-owned, census figures show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRumors of ICE raids in local kitchens have rippled throughout the community, and restaurateurs are taking to social media to discuss how they can protect their businesses and the workforce that makes them run. Nationally, celebrity chefs such as Jose Andres, Mario Batali, and Tom Colicchio are speaking out, opening the door for others in the industry to do the same in the face of President Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on immigration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible situation that certainly will impact our industry,\u201d says Babak Bina, whose BiNA Family Hospitality group runs Lala Rokh, Bin 26 Enoteca, and jm Curley, all in Boston. An immigrant himself \u2014 his family fled Iran in the late 1970s \u2014 he has had thousands of employees in his 35 years in the business.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

The Trump administration has vowed to lower the overall number of immigrants entering the country, starting most notably with a controversial ban on travel from seven countries.\n\nIf enacted, restrictions would reduce the number of people coming to the United States by at least 30 million over the next half-century, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s already complaining about not being able to find enough skilled line cooks and sous chefs and servers,\u201d said Josh Lewin, co-owner of Juliet in Somerville, who estimates 30 percent of his restaurant\u2019s roughly 20 employees are foreign-born. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about impacting the key demographic that fills those lower-level positions, which would affect the real foundation of the workforce.\u201d\n\nJuliet \u2014 along with Bon Me, the Tip Tap Room, and a handful of others \u2014 is one of the Massachusetts restaurants that have joined a national Sanctuary Restaurants movement. Participants have a zero-tolerance policy for xenophobia; many display signs or decals stating their support.\n\nUnlike sanctuary cities, this does not mean a refusal to enforce federal immigration laws. The status is not legal but symbolic, Lewin acknowledges. \u201cWe want our people to know that our attitudes haven\u2019t changed even if they feel like some of the American attitudes around them have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe appreciate them for who they are: hard-working, productive members not only of our restaurant, but of our community.\u201d\n\nMany local restaurants have held fund-raisers to support nonprofits on the forefront of the fight. On Inauguration Day, Mei Mei food truck and restaurant ran an event called \u201cNeed a Drink?\u201d in which proceeds from alcohol sales went to organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. Chef-owner Irene Li is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant who moved to the United States after fleeing the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAnd earlier this month, more than two dozen Massachusetts coffee shops and cafes participated in a weekend-long national fund-raiser for the ACLU.\n\nThe concern isn\u2019t limited to the kitchen. Restaurateurs also warn that if farms, orchards, and dairies across the country are targeted for arrest and deportation activities, it could mean labor shortages and rising food prices.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Northern California, and I can tell you straight-up that white people don\u2019t pick grapes unless it\u2019s a charming part of their honeymoon,\u201d said Tiffani Faison, chef-owner of Sweet Cheeks and Tiger Mama in Boston. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just who works in the restaurant industry. It\u2019s who\u2019s picking grapes in Napa and strawberries in Southern California and apples in Sebastopol.\u201d\n\nNationwide, restaurants employ nearly 2.3 million foreign-born workers, or 8.4 percent of immigrants in the US labor force. The Massachusetts Restaurant Association estimates the state has 15,250 restaurants collectively employing 330,000 people. That\u2019s one of every 10 jobs, not including indirect employment such as food suppliers.\n\n\u201cWhat restaurants have been looking for is no different than what we were looking for from President Obama and previous presidents: a solid immigration policy,\u201d said MRA president Bob Luz \u2014 one that \u201cgives direction and a clear avenue for hard-working folks who want to come to the US and start a new and different life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already have an employee shortage,\u201d he added. If legal avenues for immigrants to enter the country begin to close, \u201cthat\u2019s going to suffocate us more and more.\u201d", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
