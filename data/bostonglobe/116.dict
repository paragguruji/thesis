Bean is among the companies concerned with President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning travel from seven countries and halting the nation\u2019s refugee program.\n\nPolitico reports that the Maine-based duck boot business\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Smith, issued a memo last week to staff saying L.L. Bean is \u201ccommitted to help our affected employees in any way possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecent national policy changes, while dominating the headlines and sparking a wide-range of opinion, are also creating confusion and concern within our family of great employees,\u201d he wrote, according to the report.\n\nAs of last summer, about 12,000 Somalian refugees had resettled in Maine, including 7,000 in Lewiston, where L.L. Bean operates a manufacturing facility. Somalia is one of the countries named in Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day\u2019s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Bean boasts that it won an award in 2007 for hiring members of the Somali community during the holidays.\n\nSmith\u2019s memo comes just weeks after L.L. Bean was forced to defend itself from calls to boycott its products because Linda Bean, a company heiress and board member, had donated to a political action committee supporting Trump.\n\nIn response to the boycott, L.L. Bean said it does not make political endorsements or donations. The issue was amplified a few days later by Trump himself, when he offered his support to the company in a tweet, causing L.L. Bean to again say it does not take political positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Politico, Smith acknowledged in the memo that the company had tried to avoid politics.\n\n\u201cWhile we have gone to great pains over the past few weeks to distance ourselves from an unfortunate and unwanted political situation, there have been some more recent developments that have prompted me to share some thoughts and direction,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMany regional and national companies have criticized Trump\u2019s executive order. The order is currently on hold due to a temporary restraining order issued last week by a federal judge in Seattle.\n\nA spokeswoman for L.L. Bean did not respond to a request for comment from the Globe.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
