On Thursday, it will have been 90 days since the president issued his first travel ban aimed at residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nAnd that day, unlike the traditional 100-day mark, isn\u2019t an arbitrary juncture to assess the president\u2019s record. The executive order itself set 90 days as the initial time frame for the ban. When it was announced, Trump said the travel ban was intended to buy time, to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d and allow the administration to craft its new, double-secret, extreme vetting.\n\nThe administration didn\u2019t get its ban. But it has had its 90 days. If the Trump administration really intended to toughen vetting standards, nothing about any of the court orders striking down the ban has stopped it from delivering on that promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the administration\u2019s failure to make any meaningful changes to entry procedures in that time merely confirms what was obvious when it first started causing chaos at airports in January: The ban was for show, a publicity stunt that accomplished nothing and was probably never intended to.\n\nGet Truth and Consequences in your inbox: Michael A.

Trump\u2019s own words during the campaign, when he promised to ban Muslims from entering the country, helped opponents of the ban prove its illegally discriminatory intent.\n\nAnd the stunt came at a cost \u2014 measured in cancelled travel to the United States, lost business, disrupted lives. Most of all, it weakened whatever remained of America\u2019s moral standing in the world.\n\nThis being Trump, though, we probably haven\u2019t heard the last of the travel ban. If the president has proved anything, it\u2019s that he always needs someone other than himself to blame if something goes wrong. In the event of a terrorist attack in the United States, it\u2019s disturbingly easy to imagine the president blaming the federal courts who blocked his travel ban.\n\nIt will be up to his political opponents to make the case, as loudly as possible, that Trump has had all the time he wanted to figure out what the hell is going on and make any necessary changes. The fact the president and his administration now have so little to show for it not only reinforces doubts about the ban\u2019s motives all along, but also removes any excuse Trump might try to offer for any failures that occur on his watch.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-04-25", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["bigotry", "travel", "administration", "trump", "ban", "days", "intended", "verdict", "trumps", "president", "90", "looks"], "summary": "Protesters carry rafts, signifying the struggle of refugees, during a protest in New York City in March against the Trump administration's proposed travel ban and refugee policie.\nThe hoopla surrounding the upcoming 100th day of President Trump\u2019s administration obscures a much more damning milestone in the young presidency.\nOn Thursday, it will have been 90 days since the president issued his first travel ban aimed at residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nThe executive order itself set 90 days as the initial time frame for the ban.\nBut it has had its 90 days."}
