But research groups at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital were among those who lost incoming scholars to the travel ban.\n\nLate Saturday at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, immigration lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts filed a suit on behalf of two associate professors from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who are Iranian nationals. According to the suit, Mazdak Pourabdollah Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam had been detained at Logan International Airport for three hours that evening under Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Other schools didn\u2019t provide tallies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe order went into effect Friday night and affects travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, including green card holders. US Customs and Border Protection officials didn\u2019t respond to messages, but a spreadsheet created by an MIT professor to track those affected nationwide had 120 to 130 entries by Saturday afternoon.\n\nMost were Iranian nationals and included people who hold green cards, immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, and dual citizenships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating. It is disrupting people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Hazhir Rahmandad, the MIT professor who created the spreadsheet and shared it on social media.\n\n\u201cWe have PhD students who are in trouble. We have a lot of graduate applicants that we might not be able to get. We have colleagues who are stranded. Some people we might be recruiting for our faculty positions might consider the US to be untenable,\u201d said Rahmandad, who was born in Iran and naturalized as a US citizen in 2010.\n\nHe said his parents, who hold green cards, had planned a visit from Iran to celebrate birthdays for their grandchildren, twins who are turning 2.\n\n\u201cAt a personal level, this is not the country that I knew and I trusted and I have adopted as my new home,\u201d Rahmandad said. \u201cI lived through the Iran-Iraq War and I don\u2019t think I was as stressed as what I\u2019m facing these days. It\u2019s so far from our values.\u201d\n\nAmong others whose plans were disrupted was Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a scientist from Iran, who was planning to come to Boston with his wife to work at a research laboratory specializing in cardiovascular disease at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nNow his visa has been suspended for three months.\n\n\u201cMany Iranians are successful persons in the field of science and trade in US. We are peaceful people and we are out of political games,\u201d Saravi, 30, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWe learn, research, work for development of our country and help to improve the public health of global populations. . . . I am so sorry for this decision.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas Michel, a cardiologist who hired Saravi to work in his lab, got the news Friday. He said the travel ban is jeopardizing the country\u2019s position in the scientific community.\n\n\u201cSo many people who have been trained in science in this country have gone on to do amazing things in the US and their home countries,\u201d Michel said. \u201cThat is being undermined.\u201d\n\nSamira Asgari of Iran was blocked from coming into the country.\n\nSamira Asgari, an Iranian who holds a doctorate from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland, was traveling to Boston to begin working on a tuberculosis project at a Harvard Medical School laboratory \u2014 but she and her boyfriend were turned away at the Frankfurt airport.\n\n\u201cThey took me a few meters away and took my passport and told me my visa\u2019s not valid,\u201d Asgari said in a Skype interview. \u201cI told him I do have a valid visa, but he told me that it doesn\u2019t matter. I asked him, \u2018What can I do now?,\u2019 and he told me to go home.\u201d\n\nShe would have worked under Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri, a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who told the Globe he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe that somebody with a visa with her standing would be denied entry.\u201d\n\nAsgari was granted a J-1 Visa to work in the United States, Raychaudhuri said. She was also awarded two years of research funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation.\n\n\u201cI was really ready to go,\u201d Asgari said. \u201cI had done everything right.\u201d\n\nAt Logan Airport, immigration lawyers hung fliers offering free legal assistance to people affected by Trump\u2019s actions. They were joined by Attorney General Maura Healey, US Senator Elizabeth Warren, and demonstrators who held proimmigration signs with messages such as, \u201cNo Ban\u201d and \u201cNo Wall.\u201d\n\nHealey called Trump\u2019s order unconstitutional, saying his actions violated the rights of immigrants who have already been vetted and have a legal right to return to the United States.\n\nChurch said the restriction on green card holders is especially onerous because those people have already gone through extensive interviews and background checks.\n\nPeople who enter through the US Refugee Resettlement Program are processed at six airports in places such as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, but not in Boston, she said.\n\nNortheastern\u2019s president, Joseph E. Aoun, and several other school officials sent an e-mail to members of the university community saying they should feel safe there.\n\n\u201cWe, the leadership of the university, stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you \u2014 students, faculty, and staff,\u201d the e-mail said.\n\nDean Cavaretta, the former state director of the Trump campaign, said the executive order is not intended to rid the country of students and other people who have positively contributed to the economy. He hopes Massachusetts residents will \u201ctake a breath\u201d and give the Trump administration time to create a process for allowing legal residents while keeping the country safe.\n\n\u201cI recognize the disruption and inconvenience this is going to cause especially for a multicultural and highly academic state like Massachusetts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we know enough about President Trump to know that he can be bold and he\u2019s going to see this through.\u201d\n\nAt Boston University, neuroscience major Raya Bidshahri, 21, said the travel ban means her parents won\u2019t be able to come from Iran for her graduation in the spring. Bidshahri was born in Iran, but her family has a permanent residence in Dubai.\n\nShe said her parents worked tirelessly so she could attend school in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re devastated that this has taken such a turn,\u201d said Bidshahri, who plans to move to Canada after graduation to establish an education business with others.\n\nNael Hafez, a Syrian-born American citizen who lives in Concord, said the executive order is \u201ctearing families apart.\u201d\n\nHis cousin, a legal resident who lives in Watertown, traveled to Syria in November to take care of his sick mother. He is supposed to return in February, but his family is worried he\u2019ll be stopped at the airport.\n\n\u201cI happen to be a veteran, and this is not the country that I fought for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was 11 years old when I raised my right hand and took the first oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. Many Americans have never sworn in, and for my allegiance and for my patriotism to be questioned because of where I was born, that\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The scene at the Logan Airport protest.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "type": "article"}
