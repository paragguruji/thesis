In a lengthy cable sent to embassies and consulates around the world, officials said that extended family connections would not be sufficient to evade the president\u2019s ban on entry. Parents, including in-laws, are considered \u201cclose family,\u201d but grandparents are not, for instance. Stepsiblings and half-siblings will be allowed, but not nieces or nephews.\n\nOn Thursday night, Hawaii filed a court challenge to the limitations on the family relationships.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Civil rights groups vowed to challenge what they said was a renewed attempt by Trump to keep Muslims out of the country.\n\n\u201cIt remains clear that President Trump\u2019s purpose is to disparage and condemn Muslims,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, adding that the government\u2019s new ban on entry \u201cdoes not comport with the Supreme Court\u2019s order, is arbitrary, and is not tied to any legitimate government purpose.\u201d\n\nOne week after taking office, Trump shut down travel from seven mostly Muslim countries, including Iraq, and blocked entry by all refugees, saying that a \u201cpause\u201d was necessary to evaluate the vetting of visitors from places that the government deemed dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics assailed that first order as a veiled attempt to make good on Trump\u2019s campaign promise to impose a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d After courts blocked it, the president issued a modified order directed at six countries, not including Iraq. That order was blocked as well, with federal appeals courts ruling that it discriminated based on religion, in violation of the First Amendment, and exceeded the president\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nThe decision Thursday by the administration to revive and aggressively enforce another version of the president\u2019s travel ban is certain to keep the intense debate about America\u2019s borders going into the Supreme Court\u2019s fall term, when the justices are scheduled to decide the legal fate of Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict entry by particular groups.\n\nOfficials said they were determined to \u201cmeet the intent of the presidential directive\u201d within the boundaries set by the Supreme Court, which issued an interim opinion when it agreed to consider the issue in its next term.\n\nHours before the new guidelines went into effect Thursday evening, officials predicted little of the chaos that engulfed airports in January, when the president issued his original travel ban. This time, officials said, people already booked to travel to the United States would be allowed to enter. And they made it clear that legal permanent residents were not affected by the ban.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s newest move could prompt another wave of litigation as advocates for those trying to enter the United States ask courts to halt enforcement of the ban. Already, lawyers in Washington have filed a lawsuit asking the court to allow the entry of refugees with no \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nOther lawyers representing people who have been blocked from visiting the United States described the government\u2019s actions as mean-spirited.\n\n\u201cAllowing a US citizen to bring their Syrian mother-in-law but not their Syrian brother-in-law doesn\u2019t make us any safer, and doesn\u2019t even really make any sense,\u201d said Gadeir Abbas, a staff lawyer on the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nTrump has said that his travel ban does not directly target Muslims, although the six countries on the list that the president has deemed as dangerous \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria. and Yemen \u2014 are majority Muslim.\n\nJavad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, condemned the administration\u2019s move, writing on Twitter: \u201cUS now bans Iranian grandmothers from seeing their grandchildren, in a truly shameful exhibition of blind hostility to all Iranians.\u201d\n\nFor refugees fleeing civil wars and violence around the world, the administration\u2019s action on Thursday means that a 120-day ban on entry from all countries will likely bar many of them from finding safety in the United States.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the United States so far this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. Officials predicted that the new 50,000 cap would be reached by July 6, so refugees who are planning to travel after that date will not automatically be allowed into the country.\n\nEven after the 50,000 limit is reached, however, refugees with family ties who meet the new guidelines will be allowed into the United States, officials said.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
