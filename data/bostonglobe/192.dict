But US Customs and Border Protection said that the detention and return were unrelated to the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis individual was deemed inadmissible to the US based on information discovered during the [customs] inspection for reasons unrelated to the Executive Order,\u201d the agency said in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cIn order to demonstrate that they are admissible, the applicant must overcome ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,\u201d the agency said.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

In the same statement, Children\u2019s also held out hope that Dehnavi and his family would be allowed to stay.\n\n\u201cBoston Children\u2019s hopes that this situation will be quickly resolved and Dr. Dehnavi and his family will be released and allowed to enter the US,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe hospital is committed to doing its utmost to support Dr. Dehnavi and his family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the hospital\u2019s efforts were apparently unsuccessful. In an e-mail shortly after 6 p.m. Tuesday, spokesman Rob Graham said, \u201cWe understand that the family is being sent back to Iran per the decision of Customs and Border Patrol.\u201d\n\nStephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Patrol confirmed Dehnavi and his family were put on a return flight around 9 p.m.\n\nTrita Parsi A photo of Mohsen Dehnavi's visa.\n\nMohammad Rashidian, a Boston Children\u2019s Hospital researcher and friend of Dehnavi\u2019s,\n\ntold STAT, a publication owned by Boston Globe Media Partners, that airport officials told him that the family would need to complete additional paperwork in Iran.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what the source of the problem is,\u201d said Rashidian, who told STAT he was supposed to pick the family up from the airport on Monday afternoon.\n\nOfficials with Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s office said they were in touch with Massport, the agency that runs Logan, and Boston Children\u2019s.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-07-11", "type": "article"}
