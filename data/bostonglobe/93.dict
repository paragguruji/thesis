(AP) \u2014 A top White House aide renewed support for President Donald Trump\u2019s embattled immigration order and praised a surge in deportations Sunday, as the new president faces a new provocation in the form of an apparent missile test by North Korea.\n\nThe White House continues to weigh its options following a legal blow last week to Trump\u2019s immigration order suspending the nation\u2019s refugee program and barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen Miller, Trump\u2019s chief policy adviser and one of the architects of the order, maintained in a round of Sunday show interviews that the president has sweeping executive authority when it comes to barring foreigners he deems pose a risk to the country. He said Trump will do \u2018\u2018whatever we need to do, consistent with the law, to keep this country safe\u2019\u2019 and slammed judges who\u2019ve stood in his way.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a judicial usurpation of the power. It is a violation of judges\u2019 proper roles in litigating disputes. We will fight it,\u2019\u2019 Miller said in an interview on \u2018\u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019\u2019\n\nGet This Week in Politics in your inbox: A weekly recap of the top political stories from The Globe, sent right to your email.

Trump said on the plane ride to Florida on Friday that he was considering signing a \u2018\u2018brand new order\u2019\u2019 as early as Monday to try to bypass the legal challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018As you know, we have multiple options, and we are considering all of them,\u2019\u2019 Miller said on ABC\u2019s \u2018\u2018This Week.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe comments come amid an outcry from immigration activists over an \u2018\u2018enforcement surge\u2019\u2019 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that officials say is targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally and have criminal records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvocacy groups contend the government has rounded up large numbers of people as part of stepped-up enforcement. The agency calls the effort no different from enforcement actions carried out in the past.\n\nBut Trump and Miller appeared eager to take credit for the action.\n\n\u2018\u2018The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted.\n\nAdded Miller on NBC\u2019s \u2018\u2018Meet the Press\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018We\u2019re going to focus on public safety and saving American lives and we will not apologize.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn the meantime, Miller insisted it wasn\u2019t up to him to say whether the president retains confidence in national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has come under scrutiny for his contact with the Russians before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nMiller repeated in several interviews that the White House hadn\u2019t given him anything specific to say about Flynn during his appearances on the Sunday news shows. Miller called a report that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions in calls with Russia\u2019s ambassador while President Barack Obama was still in office \u2018\u2018a sensitive matter\u2019\u2019 best answered by Trump, Vice President Mike Pence or chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nTrump has spent the weekend in Florida at his sprawling Mar-a-Lago estate, holding meetings, making calls, golfing and hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nFor most of Saturday, Trump and the Japanese prime minister played golf under the Florida sun to get to know one another and show the world the U.S.-Japan alliance remained strong. A surprise provocation by the North Koreans provided a more significant example of cooperation.\n\nAfter North Korea reportedly launched a ballistic missile, the two leaders appeared for hastily prepared statements in a ballroom of Trump\u2019s south Florida estate late Saturday. Abe spoke first and longest.\n\n\u2018\u2018North Korea\u2019s most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,\u2019\u2019 Abe said through a translator. He added that the North must comply fully with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, but also noted that Trump had assured him that the U.S. supported Japan.\n\n\u2018\u2018President Trump and I myself completely share the view that we are going to promote further cooperation between the two nations. And also we are going to further reinforce our alliance,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTrump followed Abe with even fewer words, saying in part: \u2018\u2018I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.\u2019\u2019 With that, they left the room.\n\nMiller said on ABC that the joint appearance marked \u2018\u2018an important show of solidarity between the United States and Japan.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Last night, what you saw was the president of the United States sending a powerful and unmistakable signal to North Korea and the entire world as he stood shoulder to shoulder with the prime minister of Japan and declared our steadfast and unwavering support of the alliance,\u2019\u2019 he added on \u2018\u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump is to remain in Florida through Sunday evening and is scheduled to meet with his pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his longtime friend-turned-Republican National Committee finance chair Steve Wynn, before heading back to Washington.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
