The Trump administration Saturday evening filed notice appealing the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 27 order barred visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from the United States for 90 days, halted the entire refugee program for 120 days, and closed the door to Syrian refugees indefinitely. The restrictions don\u2019t apply to green-card holders, officials have said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump used Twitter Saturday to blast the decision by US District Judge James Robart. The president and his aides have argued that the executive order will make the country safer. Demonstrators across the country have protested against Trump\u2019s directive.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

Some are expected to arrive Monday, an official said.\n\nHomeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said the agency would follow Robart\u2019s ruling and \u201cresume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe called Trump\u2019s order \u201clawful and appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe order is intended to protect the homeland and the American people, and the president has no higher duty and responsibility than to do so,\u201d Christensen said.\n\nRobart\u2019s decision not only temporarily halts all the major elements of Trump\u2019s order but also temporarily puts the brakes on provisions capping the number of refugees allowed into the country this fiscal year at 50,000 and giving preference to religious minorities seeking refugee status.\n\nIn his ruling, Robart wrote that Trump\u2019s directive \u201cadversely affects\u2019\u2019 residents of Washington and Minnesota, who brought the court challenge.\n\n\u201cThis (order) is granted on a nationwide basis\u2019\u2019 the ruling said, and prohibited enforcement of the president\u2019s executive order \u201cat all United States borders and ports of entry pending further orders from this court.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision is expected to pave the way for Iraqi doctor Deelan Dakhil to travel to Washington, D.C., Monday with her sister, Vian, who is receiving a human rights award from the Lantos Foundation, a New Hampshire organization.\n\nVian Dakhil, a member of Iraq\u2019s Parliament, is being recognized for her efforts to combat terrorism, a crusade which made her into one of ISIS\u2019s \u201cMost Wanted\u201d women.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson granted her special permission to travel, said Katrina Lantos Swett, the foundation\u2019s president.\n\nDeelan Dakhil said her sister is eager to visit the United States to discuss the Yazidi people, a religious sect in Iraq that faced mass genocide and religious persecution by the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe have always thought that the best place that we can deliver our voice is the US because it is the country of freedom and democracy,\u201d Deelan Dakhil said in an e-mail.\n\nAttorneys in Boston who have fought Trump\u2019s executive order welcomed the government announcements, which means visa holders from the affected countries can travel to the United States freely for now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a great country where the courts fulfilled their ultimate purpose as envisioned by the founding fathers to prevent one branch of the government from acting unconstitutionally or unethically,\u201d said attorney Susan Church, who leads the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nCarol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said the announcements are good news for the families involved.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about actual human lives and the ability for people to be reunited with their families.\u201d\n\nAt Logan International Airport Saturday afternoon, expectant families waited with signs, flowers, and tissues for loved ones to arrive on a Lufthansa flight carrying about 40 Iranians, many of whom had been turned back at least once over the past week.\n\nMahdi Hashemian and his wife, Homa Koohi, waited with their 4-year-old daughter, Zeynab, for Homa\u2019s mother, Akram Khajehali, who lives Iran.\n\nWhen the family first came to Boston about two years ago so Hashemian could enter a PhD program at MIT, Koohi said she loved how free Americans were to speak and express themselves, how they embraced people for who they were, and how they advocated for human rights.\n\nNow, she said, it felt like the country was moving backward.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like before,\u201d she said.\n\nJeffrey Thielman, president and chief executive of the International Institute of New England, said his staff is ready to welcome refugees to the United States. The organization helps resettle refugees in Boston, Lowell, and Manchester, N.H.\n\n\u201cOur team will be ready to receive refugees as early as Monday,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Saturday amid the confusion of conflicting information, Thielman said his staff tried to calm families worried about their plights. He shared their concern but also expressed a measure of hope in the system. \u201cWe are still a nation of laws,\u201d he said, \u201ceven though right now it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d\n\nDespite the travel ban, the Trump administration allowed 872 refugees into the country through Friday. Another 21 Afghans who worked as US military translators and were granted special interest visas are expected to arrive this month, Thielman said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s announcements capped a hectic week in which lawyers nationwide tried to block Trump\u2019s order and travelers from the affected nations scrambled get into the country.\n\nThe first federal court orders temporarily blocking the ban were issued in New York and Boston, though some attorneys said it was unclear whether the Trump administration heeded the earlier rulings.\n\nLike the Seattle ruling, a decision issued in Boston Jan. 29 was supposed to apply nationwide, but some travelers were still blocked from boarding planes, lawyers said.\n\nBoston immigration attorney Kerry Doyle urged people with valid visas who may be affected by Trump\u2019s order to travel to the US quickly given the government\u2019s appeal plans.\n\n\u201cI would tell the person overseas to get on a plane and come home,\u201d she said.\n\nFederal officials disclosed Friday that nearly 60,000 visas were revoked as a result of the ban, which Massachusetts officials said thrust hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses and colleges into turmoil. Professors, scientists, and doctors who had left the United States were shocked to discover that they could not return home.\n\nTrump supporters, however, said the president\u2019s order is fulfilling his promise to voters.\n\n\u201cA temporary pause from seven countries is not a \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 \u201d said Dean Cavaretta, former state director for Trump\u2019s primary campaign in Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019d like to see our Congress, instead of running to a microphone, work to solve the larger problem.\u201d\n\nHours before Robart\u2019s decision Friday, a federal judge in Boston sided with the Trump administration in a case challenging the ban.\n\nUS District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton in Massachusetts refused to extend a temporary stay on the president\u2019s ban, saying Trump would likely succeed in the case on the grounds that he has broad authority over federal immigration laws.\n\nSaturday evening, President Trump tweeted his exasperation that Gorton\u2019s ruling hadn\u2019t gotten more notice: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision,\u201d Trump asked.\n\nLawyers who brought the case said Saturday that they are reviewing their options.\n\nThe case initially had been filed on behalf of two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professors, both Muslim green card holders from Iran, who were detained and interrogated for about three hours Jan. 28 at Logan.\n\nLegal analysts said the split between the decisions in Seattle and Boston could fast-track the appeals process and possibly open the door for the US Supreme Court to get involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that the courts will look at the issue and make different rationales, and reach different conclusions, and ultimately these things will be litigated, and if the courts differ it will go all the way up and go before the US Supreme Court,\u201d said Howard Cooper, a Boston attorney who has followed the cases.\n\nWhat remains unclear is what avenue the Justice Department will take in appealing Robart\u2019s ruling. The appeal notice filed Saturday evening didn\u2019t include the government\u2019s legal arguments it wants the higher court to consider.\n\nWhen he issued his order Friday, Robart said he would hold a follow-up hearing to decide whether to extend it. That hearing hasn\u2019t been scheduled.\n\nMilton J. Valencia of the Globe staff and Globe correspondent Nicole Fleming contributed. Associated Press material was used in this report.
