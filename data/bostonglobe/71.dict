Kennedy\u2019s departure would allow conservatives to take firm control of the court.\n\nBut Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years. Several of his former law clerks have said they think he is contemplating stepping down in the next year or so. Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

Three of those, all involving immigrants or foreigners, were heard by an eight-justice court, before Gorsuch joined the bench in April.\n\nIf the eight justices are evenly divided, those cases could be argued a second time in the fall, with Gorsuch available to provide the tie-breaking vote.\n\nIn his short time on the court, Gorsuch has already paired up four times with Justice Clarence Thomas \u2014 the court\u2019s most conservative member \u2014 in separate opinions that dissent from or take issue with the court\u2019s majority rulings.\n\nWhile the sample size is small, the results show Gorsuch\u2019s commitment to follow the strict text of the law and a willingness to join Thomas in pushing the envelope further than the court\u2019s other conservatives.\n\nGorsuch was picked by Trump to be a reliable conservative in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. But the question after his confirmation hearings was how far to the right he would be.\n\nThe early trend of Gorsuch and Thomas acting together has pleased those who hoped Gorsuch would continue Scalia\u2019s legacy and be another intellectual beacon for conservatives.\n\nThe latest instance came Friday when Gorsuch issued his first written dissent in a minor case about a federal employee challenging his dismissal from the US Census Bureau. The dispute was over where Anthony Perry could appeal a case that alleges violations of both federal civil service rules and laws prohibiting discrimination.\n\nThe court sided with Perry, ruling 7 to 2 that he could file his lawsuit in a federal district court instead of first waiting for a federal appeals court to consider part of his case. In dissent, Gorsuch faulted the majority for failing to apply the law as written.\n\n\u2018\u2018Anthony Perry asks us to tweak a congressional statute \u2014 just a little \u2014 so that it might (he says) work a bit more efficiently,\u2019\u2019 Gorsuch said, joined by Thomas. \u2018\u2018No doubt his invitation is well meaning. But it\u2019s one we should decline all the same.\u2019\u2019\n\nLater, he added: \u2018\u2018If a statute needs repair, there\u2019s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it,\u2019\u2019 Gorsuch said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s called legislation.\u2019\u2019\n\nA day earlier, Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion when the Supreme Court unanimously limited the government\u2019s ability to strip US citizenship from immigrants who lie during the naturalization process.\n\nJoined by Thomas, Gorsuch said the majority ruling was correct, but he argued that following \u2018\u2018the plain text and structure of the statute\u2019\u2019 was enough.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-06-24", "type": "article"}
