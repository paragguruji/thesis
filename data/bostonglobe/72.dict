The argument was held in Seattle and broadcast live on C-SPAN. The court did not say when it might rule.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

Gould said at the outset.\n\nIn making the administration\u2019s case, Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting US solicitor general, urged the court to ignore campaign statements from Trump concerning his intention to issue a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and focus instead on the terms of the revised executive order.\n\n\u201cThe order on its face doesn\u2019t have anything to do with religion,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Michael Daly Hawkins asked whether Trump had ever disavowed his campaign statements.\n\nWall responded that \u201cover time the president clarified that what he was talking about were Islamic terrorist groups and the countries that shelter or sponsor them.\u201d\n\nBut Neal K. Katyal, a lawyer for Hawaii, which is challenging the revised order, said that Trump\u2019s campaign website until very recently continued to feature a 2015 news release that said \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nThat document, Katyal said, \u201cjust happened to disappear moments before the 4th Circuit argument last week.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, a 13-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., heard arguments in a separate appeal of an order blocking part of the revised travel ban, that one from a federal judge in Maryland.\n\nJudge Richard A. Paez asked Katyal whether Trump \u201cis forever barred from issuing an executive order along these lines.\u201d\n\nKatyal responded that a revised order might be proper if Congress enacted new legislation authorizing it, if Trump explicitly disavowed his earlier statements or if he described Islam in the positive terms President George W. Bush used after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nJason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images Syrian refugee Jamila Al-Mustafa wiped her eyes as she recalled her past.\n\nWall argued that the Constitution and the immigration laws give the president vast authority to make national security judgments about who may enter the country. The role of the courts, he said, was limited to determining whether the government had a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d for taking action.\n\nLate in the argument, Hawkins asked Katyal, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be deferential to the office of president of the United States on these issues?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Katyal said \u2014 and he added that the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion supplied the answer.\n\n\u201cIs this executive order, viewed from the standpoint of an objective observer, an establishment of a disfavored religion, Islam?\u201d Katyal asked. The answer, he said, was yes.\n\nTrump issued his initial order on Jan. 27, a week into his presidency. Less than two weeks later, a different three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit affirmed an order halting it.\n\nWithin minutes of the ruling, Trump vowed to fight it. But the president did not appeal to the Supreme Court. Instead, he issued a revised executive order.\n\nThe new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. It omitted Iraq and removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. It also deleted explicit references to religion.\n\nHawaii sued to challenge the revised executive order, saying it was the product of religious hostility. On March 15, Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the US District Court in Hawaii, blocked major parts of the revised order, saying they violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on establishment of religion.\n\nWatson said statements of Trump and his advisers made clear that his executive order amounted to an attempt to treat Muslims with disfavor.", "source": "BostonGlobe.com", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "type": "article"}
