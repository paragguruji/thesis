Trump paused as he removed the cap from his pen, an executive order severely limiting immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations waiting on the desk before him.\n\nIt was Friday afternoon, and an oversize replica of the Medal of Honor hung on the Pentagon wall behind Trump.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

They had been waiting for the order to arrive, and Yountz spent Friday night in tears and disbelief.\n\nOn Saturday morning, as lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union began to prepare legal challenges to the order, the two women talked by phone. Maybe they could go to the airport and drum up some media attention, raise some awareness.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t even clear early Saturday morning whether the order was being enforced. And anyway, Church\u2019s kids had sports and other activities to get to; Yountz had been planning to take her son to an immigration rally on Boston Common. Yountz threw on jeans and sneakers, and drove in from Needham for the rally.\n\nBy mid-morning, though, everything changed. Church got word from Customs that the order was already being enforced, and a nationwide tracking document showed a citizen of one of the seven affected countries had arrived in Logan around 11 a.m. only to be put on a flight back to Europe. Church called Yountz.\n\nChurch told her, \u201cWe need to act now.\u201d\n\nThe blood drained from Yountz\u2019s face.\n\nYountz and her son raced to the front of the protest, found her car, and drove to Church\u2019s house in Newton, where she quickly showered and changed into a borrowed suit and a pair of shoes two sizes too big. Yountz\u2019s husband came and got her son; Church\u2019s husband Derege Demissie, also a partner in her firm, took their daughter rock climbing.\n\nChurch and Yountz quickly put together a list of eight immigration lawyers who were willing to take cases pro bono. If they could find someone whose relative was being held at the airport because of the executive order, they could sue.\n\nThey printed out fliers with the lawyers\u2019 names and cell phone numbers and drove to the airport. It was 3:30 p.m.\n\nUsing a roll of green hockey tape that Church grabbed from her son, they started posting fliers and approaching anybody they thought might be waiting for someone being detained.\n\nBut as hours ticked past, nobody appeared to be waiting for a missing loved one.\n\nFor lawyers in need of a plaintiff, this was a problem.\n\n\u201cTo file any lawsuit, you need a plaintiff.\u201d said Church. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go in and say, \u2018this is wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\n***\n\nSomewhere high above the Atlantic ocean, Mazdak Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam watched a movie on a Boeing 777 bound for Logan.\n\nIranian immigrants who have lived in the United States as permanent residents for more than a decade, the couple had left home a week earlier for a conference in Marseille. Both engineering professors at UMass Dartmouth, they each had doctoral degrees from Johns Hopkins University. They traveled often.\n\nBut they\u2019d arrived at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris on Saturday to a warning. New rules, enacted in the last 24 hours, could cause the couple some problems on their journey home.\n\nAn official had checked a few things and told them that they\u2019d be OK: They both had green cards.\n\nAt 4 p.m. Paris time, they boarded the flight home, seeing no reason to worry.\n\nThe flight landed at Logan about half an hour early, about 5:30 p.m. Eastern time. Tootkaboni and Louhghalam passed through the normal processing for permanent residents, but something was different.\n\nThey were pulled aside, Tootkaboni said, and told they were subject to new screening. They were brought to a private room with about a dozen other people. There, they were told to wait.\n\n***\n\nAs afternoon gave way to evening, Mayor Martin J. Walsh headed home after a typical Saturday as mayor: stops at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury, an affordable housing project on Dorchester Avenue, and an anniversary celebration in the South End.\n\nCNN flickered on his television. He\u2019d been on that morning, talking about his pledge to allow immigrants to seek sanctuary at City Hall. Now, he was watching word of detentions and protests spread to Chicago O\u2019Hare, Washington D.C., and beyond.\n\nAt 6 p.m. Walsh tweeted a statement calling Trump\u2019s executive order a \u201creckless policy . . . rooted in fear, not substance\u201d that \u201cfurther divides us as a nation & world. It is simply morally wrong.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough. His staff kept him apprised of the growing crowd at Logan.\n\n\u201cI need to show support for people being detained,\u201d Walsh later recalled thinking. \u201cPart of it was anger. I was angry and a little sad. This is America. This is the United States of America and I was watching the country divide in front of my eyes.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAt Logan, Church was growing despondent. She and Yountz sat on a bench with what was left of their fliers. It was 6 p.m. An AirFrance flight that had just arrived, they realized, might be their last chance to find someone.\n\nThey\u2019d been looking for more than two hours, Yountz traipsing around in her boss\u2019s oversize shoes, when a woman in the next chair said something that sent a charge through both women.\n\n\u201cOne of us hears the woman say \u2018case by case basis,\u2019 \u201d Church said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the language of the executive order \u2014 they\u2019re obviously clinging to the idea that their loved one is going to be let in on a case by case basis.\u201d\n\nThe women were waiting for relatives who were flying back to MIT, they said. The flight had landed more than half an hour ago and they still hadn\u2019t emerged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we realized that there were some people being detained,\u201d Yountz said. \u201cEverything just changed in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\n***\n\nRodrigo Saavedra bounced toward Logan with his brother, Carlos, and another protester in a white 1998 Toyota 4Runner a little after 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cThere are certain moments that we call trigger events that can spark the public to do something and be called to action,\u201d said Saavedra, an organizer for Cosecha, an organization named with the Spanish word for \u201charvest\u201d that advocates for immigrants.\n\nSaavedra had spent the afternoon working his iPhone and laptop, conspiring with a network of organizers. Carlos was typing just as furiously. The brothers had emigrated with their parents from Peru nearly two decades before.\n\nAt about 5:30 p.m., their flier had hit Facebook. The notice called for protesters to gather at Logan International Airport to \u201cbe witnesses and put pressure at every airport to fight the #MuslimBan!\u201d\n\nThey left the car in long-term parking and hustled to Terminal E, where they joined 20 or so protesters already assembling. Within an hour, it was 40. Then 100. Then 300. Then more.\n\nOne by one, immigrants and refugees stepped forward to tell their stories. After each tale, the crowd sang an encouraging refrain: \u201cCourage, my friend. You do not walk alone.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAt Logan, everything seemed to erupt at once.\n\nThe protest swelled, and detainees began to trickle out.\n\nLawyers and law students had arrived, and delivered cellphone chargers, water, and sandwiches to Church, Yountz, and others who were working to find a willing plaintiff out of the view of reporters.\n\nOne woman said her sister and brother-in-law were still inside. They were professors at UMass Dartmouth on their way home from a conference.\n\nAt around 7:30 p.m., Church called Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Segal had been among the several lawyers offering representation at Logan but had left to work on possible court papers.\n\n\u201cWe have a plaintiff!\u201d\n\nSegal started getting the papers together.\n\n\u201cSomebody has to actually go and do the writing, so he took the lead in doing a lot of the drafting,\u201d said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.\n\nBut to have a court hearing, you need more than just a plaintiff.\n\nA friend of Church\u2019s found US Magistrate Judge Judith Dein\u2019s cellphone number, and Church reached her at the Shubert Theatre, where a New York City dance company was performing the work of Jessica Lang.\n\n\u201cWe need a hearing,\u201d Church pleaded. Dein agreed.\n\nIt was about 8:30 p.m. She called Segal again: He had an hour to finish the complaint.\n\nAs Tootkaboni and Louhghalam waited deep inside Logan airport, Church and Yountz set out for court.\n\n***\n\nAt 9:04, Walsh dashed off a tweet: \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Logan Airport to join the protest against President Trump\u2019s Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nDriven by his security detail, Walsh arrived at 9:27 p.m. The chants of 800 to 1,000 protesters quieted as a woman handed Walsh a red megaphone.\n\n\u201cThank you for standing up for democracy!\u201d Walsh shouted as a stream of passengers disembarked with rolling suitcases.\n\nThis was the scene Tootkaboni and Louhghalam emerged onto when they were finally released, about four hours after they\u2019d been stopped. Their stay had not been unpleasant, Tootkaboni said. The people who had interviewed them had been \u201cvery, very professional and unexpectedly kind and nice,\u201d he said, and checked in every half-hour or so to see if they needed water or a trip to the restroom.\n\nThey were unaware of the chaos outside and, until they emerged, had no idea they were the plaintiffs on a remarkable legal pleading happening in the courthouse across the channel.\n\n***\n\nAt the courthouse, lawyers showed up in droves. Some came from formal events, wearing cocktail dresses and designer shawls, high heels and sleeveless numbers; one wore jeans.\n\nThough the complaint was drafted, it hadn\u2019t been filed \u2014 they had no docket number.\n\nChurch called her husband, Demissie, who was at home with a cocktail.\n\n\u201cI need you to sue the president of the United States,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d he answered.\n\nFrom his PACER account, he filed the complaint in the court\u2019s online system.\n\nA federal district court judge, Allison Burroughs, was summoned to hear the case along with Dein. The lawyers had rushed to the emergency hearing, but now they had to wait.\n\nThe ventilation system in the courthouse was turned off, and the courtrooms were sweltering. Someone checked the thermostat in the courtroom. It was 85 degrees.\n\n***\n\nBack at Logan, the last detainee was set to be released.\n\nUS Customs officials asked Walsh if he would be her escort because she was too nervous to walk through the crowd.\n\nThe mayor did not know where she was from, but he knew her world had been turned upside down.\n\n\u201cThis woman was not a threat,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cShe was not a threat to national security.\u201d\n\nAfter escorting the woman to a cab, Walsh sent a message to someone with whom he had been texting.\n\n\u201cThe final woman got out,\u201d Walsh wrote.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Senior Imam Shaykh Yasir F. Fahmy of The Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center wrote back. \u201cGod bless.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWorking together, the lawyers had divvied up the pleadings. They offered their case, and waited.\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling of everybody coming together that was something I will never forget,\u201d said Yountz.\n\n\u201cThose court clerks who came, the court officers, the marshals, they left their families, their houses, to open up the courthouse doors for the rule of law to prevail,\u201d said Church.\n\nBurroughs and Dein ruled at 1:51 a.m. Trump\u2019s order was put on hold for seven days, with a hearing to come before the restraining order expires. Lawful refugees, visa holders, permanent residents, and others who would otherwise be allowed to enter the country if not for the executive order, would be allowed in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strong,\u201d Yountz said of the ruling. \u201cIt\u2019s more than we asked for.\u201d\n\nBoston appeared poised, at least temporarily, to be the port of entry for those legal travelers who feared being caught up in the new restrictions. A nationwide ruling issued earlier Saturday night in a New York courtroom was less extensive than the one affecting Logan.\n\nIt was 2:30 in the morning. The elevator filled with lawyers in formal wear and jeans, borrowed suits and too-big shoes. Only once the doors closed did they begin to cheer.\n\nNestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @NestorARamos. Andrew Ryan can be reached at andrew.ryan@globe.com.
