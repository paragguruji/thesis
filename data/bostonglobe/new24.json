Trump, in a speech Wednesday, again cited a Boston federal court ruling as he launched into an argument that the courts should reinstate his controversial travel ban.\n\n\u201cAs you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then read and expounded upon a portion of the federal law that the administration says empowers him to impose restrictions on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump spoke at the winter meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. His remarks came after a three-judge appeals court panel in San Francisco Tuesday night heard arguments on whether to continue a suspension of the travel ban. Trump said he had listened to audio of the arguments \u2014 and had developed his own opinions.\n\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

It\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn\u2019t believe,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that really had nothing to do with what I just read.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well. OK? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on TV that was disgraceful.\u201d\n\nHe returned again to the Boston case, saying, \u201cI said to my people, \u2018Why don\u2019t you use the Boston case?\u2019 And there were reasons why they couldn\u2019t use the Boston case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere were statements made by that judge ... that were right on. They were perfect. They were perfect,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the Boston case could somehow be used in the West Coast case\n\nHe claimed that the country\u2019s security was threatened because the travel ban has been suspended. \u201cRight now we are at risk because of what happened. ... I think our security is at risk today,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Feb. 3, US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton in Boston refused to extend a temporary stay on the president\u2019s travel ban, saying Trump would likely succeed in the case on the grounds that he has broad authority over federal immigration laws. But a judge in Seattle ruled the other way the same day. That\u2019s the case that\u2019s now in the San Francisco appeals court.", "authors": ["Globe Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "source": "bostonglobe", "top_words": ["travel", "case", "refers", "trump", "ban", "night", "listened", "makes", "argument", "judge", "court", "federal", "boston", "things"], "summary": "President Donald J.
