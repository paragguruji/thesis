The specifics could change, sources told the AP.\n\nThere is likely to be an exception for refugees fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country, including Christians trying to get out of Muslim-majority countries where their communities have come under attack.\n\nThe bans would stay in place at least until specifics of what Trump has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d can be worked out.\n\nAs president, Trump can use an executive order to halt refugee processing.\n\nPresident George W. Bush used that same power after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nRefugee security vetting was reviewed and the process was restarted several months later.\n\nTrump had initially called for an outright ban on immigration from Muslim countries \u201cuntil we can figure out what\u2019s going on\u201d following terror attacks in California and Western Europe by ISIS-inspired terrorists.\n\nHe later backed away and called for the tougher vetting of immigrants from Muslim countries that are hotbeds of Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe president on Wednesday also called for the hiring of 5,000 additional border-patrol agents, which Congress would have to approve.\n\nHe said the US would end what critics call a \u201ccatch-and-release system\u201d at the border.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, some immigrants caught entering the US illegally were freed and told to report back to immigration officials at a later date. Many didn\u2019t, and disappeared into the population.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "type": "article"}
