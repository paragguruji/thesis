The implied message in the revised ban is like a \u201cneon sign flashing \u2018Muslim ban, Muslim ban'\u201d that the government didn\u2019t bother to turn off, state Attorney General Douglas Chin told the judge.\n\nExtending the temporary order until the state\u2019s lawsuit was resolved would ensure the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens across the U.S. are vindicated after \u201crepeated stops and starts of the last two months,\u201d the state has said.\n\nThe government says the ban falls within the president\u2019s power to protect national security. Hawaii has only made generalized concerns about its effect on students and tourism, Department of Justice attorney Chad Readler told the judge via telephone.\n\nThe Trump administration had asked Watson to narrow his ruling to cover only the part of Trump\u2019s executive order that suspends new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Readler said a freeze on the U.S. refugee program had no effect on Hawaii.\n\nWatson rejected that argument, preventing the administration from halting the flow of refugees.\n\nWatson said in court that the government only argued for that narrower interpretation after a federal judge in Maryland blocked the six-nation travel ban but said it wasn\u2019t clear that the refugee suspension was similarly motivated by religious bias.\n\nWatson noted that the government said 20 refugees were resettled in Hawaii since 2010.\n\n\u201cIs this a mathematical exercise that 20 isn\u2019t enough? \u2026 What do I make of that?\u201d the judge asked Readler.\n\nThe government attorney replied that 20 is simply a small number of refugees.\n\n\u201cIn whose judgment?\u201d Watson asked.\n\nsee also Another federal judge halts Trump's revised travel ban Two federal judges have frozen President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban...\n\nHawaii was the first state to sue over Trump\u2019s revised ban. The imam of a Honolulu mosque joined the challenge, arguing that the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting family in Hawaii.\n\nIn his arguments, Chin quoted Trump\u2019s comments that the revised travel ban is a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the original.\n\n\u201cWe cannot fault the president for being politically incorrect, but we do fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,\u201d Chin said.\n\nEarlier this month, Watson prevented the federal government from suspending new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and freezing the nation\u2019s refugee program. His ruling came just hours before the federal government planned to start enforcing Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nTrump called Watson\u2019s previous ruling an example of \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach.\u201d\n\nHawaii\u2019s ruling would not be directly affected by a decision siding with the federal government in the Maryland case, legal experts said. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set a hearing for May 8 to consider the administration\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cWhat a ruling in 4th Circuit in favor of the administration would do is create a split in authority between federal courts in different parts of the country,\u201d said Richard Primus, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Michigan law school.\n\n\u201cCases with splits in authority are cases the U.S. Supreme Court exists to resolve,\u201d he said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-29", "type": "article"}
