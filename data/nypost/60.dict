Representatives from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCorporate CEOs might be reluctant to express any opinion about the ban because they \u201care being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet,\u201dLarry Summers, the former Treasury secretary under President Obama, said during an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week. That is an extraordinary change in what the United States is about,\u201d Summers added.\n\nBlankfein, in his voicemail to Goldman employees, warned that the ban could hurt the global bank\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIf the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected.\u201d\n\nTech companies have been the most forceful voices in opposition to Trump\u2019s ban on anyone traveling into the US from Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria or Somalia.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,\u201d Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s CEO, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nMicrosoft, Airbnb and Lyft have also come out against the ban, while Uber CEO Travis Kalanick did so after outraged customers began deleting their Uber apps this weekend after his initial comments on the ban were noncommittal.\n\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin was spotted joining protests Saturday night at San Francisco International Airport. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has also spoken out against the ban.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
