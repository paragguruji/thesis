I then replied, \u2018But I\u2019m not free to leave \u2014 how is that not a detention?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLuckily, a new shift officer expedited his release, allowing him to miraculously make his connecting flight.\n\n\u201cAs I left the CBP makeshift detention center, I had to go back through security to catch my next flight back to DC, ironically, due to my weekly air travel, I have TSA Pre-check and was whisked through security without a hitch and made my flight by minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that to say that If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone with attributes that can be \u2018profiled,\u2019 \u201d the veteran police brass wrote. \u201cNo one is safe from this type of unlawful government intrusion.\u201d\n\nJFK became a hotspot for protests following president Trump\u2019s initial executive order on immigration \u2014 drawing swarms of protesters as travelers from seven Muslim-majority counties were detained.\n\nMore than 700 foreign nationals were detained for questioning nation-wide following the controversial EO, according to figures from the ACLU.\n\nWhile the initial federal court case battling Trump\u2019s original travel ban may be drawing to a close in Brooklyn, a slew of other district courts continue to battle the second so-called \u201cMuslim Ban,\u201d which went into effect on March 16.\n\n\u201cThis experience has left me feeling vulnerable and unsure of the future of a country that was once great and that I proudly called my own,\u201d Aden wrote. \u201cThis experience makes me question if this is indeed home.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the Privacy Act, we cannot comment on specific cases, but all travelers arriving to the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection,\u201d said a Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson.", "authors": ["March"], "publish_date": "2017-03-19", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["wrote", "detention", "travel", "customs", "cbp", "following", "chief", "aden", "trumps", "wont", "happen", "detained", "jfk"], "summary": "Former Police Chief of Greenville, Hassan Aden, claims he was held on March 13 as U.S. Customs and Border Agents attempted to clear the U.S. citizen for entry into his own country.\n\u201cMy freedoms were restricted, and I cannot be sure it won\u2019t happen again, and that it won\u2019t happen to my family, my children, the next time we travel abroad,\u201d Aden wrote in the lengthy Saturday status.\n\u201cThe answer I was given by CBP Officer Chow was that I was not being detained \u2014 he said that with a straight face.\nMore than 700 foreign nationals were detained for questioning nation-wide following the controversial EO, according to figures from the ACLU.\n\u201cThis experience has left me feeling vulnerable and unsure of the future of a country that was once great and that I proudly called my own,\u201d Aden wrote."}
