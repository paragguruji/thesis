Brown. Norah Jones, Usher and The Roots were among the musical performers.\n\nA pledge tally wasn\u2019t immediately available as the four-hour event concluded.\n\nLaughs were mixed with gravity throughout. Hanks, who conducted a lesson on the U.S. Constitution, also chatted with two ACLU lawyers he teasingly nicknamed for action stars Bruce Willis and Sandra Bullock.\n\nSome celebrities made their pleas for donations personal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an immigrant,\u201d said author and TV host Padma Lakshmi. \u201cWhat I always loved about this country is that anyone could come here\u201d without regard to race or religion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you probably can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening right now\u2026.We\u2019re going to stand for rights, we\u2019re going to stand for freedom,\u201d she said.\n\nSeth Meyers and Chelsea Clinton separately tackled the issue of voting rights, with the former first daughter saying that some state laws are making it harder to cast ballots.\n\nMeyers took a lighter approach.\n\n\u201cVoting lines should not be as long as the Porta Potty lines at Coachella. That\u2019s in the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a clip released ahead of \u201cStand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU,\u201d participants recounted successful ACLU efforts in support of school desegregation, marriage equality and abortion rights.\n\nSome mentioned Trump\u2019s actions as the impetus for their show of support. He and his administration\u2019s policies have drawn sharp opposition from many in the entertainment industry\n\n\u201cTravel bans. Executive orders. Unintelligible tweets at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Baldwin, who has repeatedly satirized Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ACLU is on it,\u201d said Holly Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU has had your back for almost 100 years,\u201d said Oscar-winning \u201cMoonlight\u201d star Mahershala Ali.\n\n\u201cMake it rain,\u201d said \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, urging viewers to donate.\n\nThe event was carried live on the Facebook pages of Stand for Rights 2017, Funny or Die and The Huffington Post.\n\nFriend of a Friend Productions produced the fundraiser in conjunction with Huffington, Funny or Die and Maggie Vision.", "source": "Page Six", "publish_date": "2017-04-01", "type": "article"}
