We disagree.\u201d\n\nTrump responded in an all-caps post on Twitter: \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nHe later told NBC the ruling was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d and predicted \u201cwe\u2019re gonna win the case.\u201d\n\nThe judges \u2014 who included one Republican \u2014 said the states of Washington and Minnesota had shown that even temporary reinstatement of the ban would cause harm to their citizens.\n\nAnd the judges also took issue with the administration\u2019s argument that the president had nearly absolute power over the nation\u2019s borders and immigration policies.\n\nWashington\u2019s state attorney, Bob Ferguson, was exuberant.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete victory for the state of Washington,\u201d he declared.\n\nTrump has insisted his travel ban wasn\u2019t aimed at Muslims.\n\nBut the appeals judges said that issue remains to be decided.\n\n\u201cThe States have offered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\n\u201cThe States\u2019 claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions,\u201d they added, saying they would defer judgment on those claims but that the issue should be addressed.\n\nTrump had earlier blasted the appeals judges who heard the Justice Department\u2019s appeal of the temporary restraining order that halted the ban as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nTrump wants to ban refugees from Syria indefinitely and refugees from six other countries plagued by terrorism \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 for 120 days.
