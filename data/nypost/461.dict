McMaster.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t screen people effectively to know who\u2019s coming into your country, then you shouldn\u2019t allow people from that country to travel,\u201d McMaster Sunday told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we are looking at.\u201d\n\nTrump Friday called for \u201clarger, tougher\u201d travel restrictions in the wake of \u201canother attack in London by a loser terrorist.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, he retweeted himself in calling for another travel ban.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u201d Trump blasted out again on Sunday.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s first travel restrictions on refugees and visitors from Muslim-majority countries were blocked by courts and panned by critics as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d Trump responded in March with a revised travel ban that was rolled out with better coordination across agencies and legal vetting.\n\nBut federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked the order and it took the Supreme Court in June to allow parts of the travel ban to go into effect. Lawyers for Trump and opponents will argue the merits of the overall case before the Supreme Court Oct. 10.\n\nMcMaster called the travel ban a good \u201cfirst step\u201d for better screening individuals and for encouraging foreign governments to share more information for tougher vetting. He\u2019s concerned about the strength of terrorist organizations\u2019 ability to communicate and their ability to move people, money, drugs and weapons internationally.\n\n\u201cWhy this is a greater danger than ever,\u201d McMaster said.\n\nIn a separate appearance on Fox News Sunday, McMaster implied the president and the National Security Council are better off now that Steve Bannon has left the\n\nWhite House. Bannon and his allies were at odds against McMaster for what they believed were his globalist views and tussled over national security decisions.\n\nTrump is best served without people who try \u201cto manipulate\u201d a particular decision and \u201cadvance your agenda,\u201d McMaster said when asked about Bannon.\n\n\u201cThere were some who tried to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas and that didn\u2019t serve the president well,\u201d McMaster said.\n\nBannon has returned to running Breitbart News, a right-wing website that has pushed for a nationalist agenda and often mocked the establishment GOP agenda.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-17", "type": "article"}
