Well, they\u2019re masterminds. I had said that before, they\u2019re masterminds. I should\u2019ve just said plot, or I should\u2019ve just called them terrorists,\u201d Conway said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cMedia Buzz.\u201d\n\nConway said she made a mistake when she cited the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d to defend Trump\u2019s needs for an immigration travel ban on MSNBC on Thursday. There was never a massacre in Bowling Green, Ky.\n\n\u201cI misspoke one word,\u201d continued Conway, who also called the dust-up \u201cmassacre nonsense.\u201d She walked back the comment on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe corrections in the newspapers who are attacking me are three paragraphs long every day. Corrections, like major corrections I mean,\u201d she said.\n\nConway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager during he presidential election, also thinks former first daughter Chelsea Clinton should mind her own \u2013 and her mother\u2019s \u2013 business.\n\n\u201cChelsea Clinton attacking me, really Chels?\u201d Conway said. \u201cBecause your mom said Texas and Georgia and Arizona were turning blue so you went and spent all this money there and you ignored Wisconsin and Michigan and we did not, and we won them and Donald Trump won.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old Clinton took to Twitter to condemn Conway\u2019s statements last week.\n\n\u201cVery grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack \u2026or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre,\u201d Clinton tweeted. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make up attacks.\u201d\n\nConway also mocked Clinton\u2019s former contract with NBC News where she reportedly made a $600,000 annual salary as a special correspondent. She was hired in 2011 and parted ways with the network in 2014 before her mom\u2019s presidential bid.\n\n\u201c$600,000 a year, woah!,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember one report she did \u2013 if you do, please help me. But I have nothing against Chelsea Clinton, I always treated her like a faberg\u00e9 egg when she was in the White House as teenager, we\u2019ll see if Barron Trump gets the same respect, so far he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should leave me out of it,\u201d Conway said.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["backlash", "clinton", "shouldve", "trump", "bowling", "corrections", "theyre", "haters", "conway", "trumps", "green", "blames", "massacre"], "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday said \u2018haters\u201d are to blame for blowing up her comments about the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d when she simply \u201cmisspoke.\u201d\u201cIt was a plot.\nI should\u2019ve just said plot, or I should\u2019ve just called them terrorists,\u201d Conway said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cMedia Buzz.\u201dConway said she made a mistake when she cited the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d to defend Trump\u2019s needs for an immigration travel ban on MSNBC on Thursday.\nThere was never a massacre in Bowling Green, Ky.\u201cI misspoke one word,\u201d continued Conway, who also called the dust-up \u201cmassacre nonsense.\u201d She walked back the comment on Friday.\nConway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager during he presidential election, also thinks former first daughter Chelsea Clinton should mind her own \u2013 and her mother\u2019s \u2013 business.\n\u201cVery grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack \u2026or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre,\u201d Clinton tweeted."}
