Bing. Bing. Bing. You\u2019re traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind \u2014 a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. Next stop, the Twilight Zone.\n\nOr, more formally, the United States Court for the District of Hawaii. That\u2019s where Judge Derrick Watson has just blocked President Trump from suspending travel to America from certain Muslim countries seething with Islamist terrorism.\n\nWatson issued on Wednesday his own nationwide ban against Trump\u2019s plan to stem migration from specific war zones. The president\u2019s aim is to beef up the vetting of such migrants \u2014 a staple of his campaign promises.\n\nNor is Watson alone. He was followed Thursday by a federal judge in Maryland who also issued an order temporarily restraining Trump. These two geniuses reckon that, among other things, Trump could well be violating the First Amendment.\n\nThat\u2019s the part of the Bill of Rights that declares: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d It\u2019s the part of America\u2019s supreme law that the judges reckon gives Muslim plaintiffs standing to challenge Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s not my purpose here to question the patriotism of the vast majority of America\u2019s Muslims. Or to deny the excruciating predicament in which they\u2019ve been put by our common enemies operating in the name of Islam.\n\nWhat dimension, though, are these judges living in? Their orders are totally detached from what the framers of the Constitution meant when they prohibited Congress from making any law \u201crespecting an establishment of religion.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Founders word it that way? History suggests their aim was not to separate religion and state. It was, rather, to prevent Congress from enacting a national religion while also protecting already enacted religious establishments \u2014 official religions \u2014 at the state level.\n\nAt least six states had established religions in our early years, according to the Heritage Foundation. This finally came to an end in 1819, when Massachusetts disestablished the Congregationalist church.\n\nOur judges have long since plunged past original intent on religious establishment. But the Founders would have been aghast at the idea that the Establishment Clause prohibited, say, a president from vetting refugees to intercept terrorists.\n\nWe can suppose this because of what happened in 1785, when a group of Algerians hailing from the Barbary Coast, with whose pirates America was in effect at war, entered Virginia. The Commonwealth\u2019s legal sticklers passed a law authorizing the governor to hold, question and expel them.\n\nThe governor, Patrick Henry, had already expelled the Algerians by the time Virginia\u2019s legislators finished the law authorizing him to do so. Its author was none other than James Madison, who went on to write the very First Amendment now being used against Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to traveling to another dimension, the judges\u2019 folly on the First Amendment is nothing compared to their attempts to go beyond reading Trump\u2019s presidential order. They are trying to read his mind.\n\nThis is the business about the presidential motive, which keeps cropping up in these orders. In the latest, the judge in Maryland, Theodore Chuang, reckons Trump\u2019s campaign stumping about a ban on Muslims is evidence of him having a \u201creligious purpose.\u201d\n\nChuang holds Trump to account not only for his own words but also for Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s. The record is so explicit, Chuang suggests, as to \u201callow the Court to identify the purpose\u201d of Trump\u2019s travel ban \u201cwithout resort to \u2018judicial psychoanalysis.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo Chuang, like Watkins in Hawaii, is prepared to issue a nationwide restraining order against the president \u2014 in the middle of a war. Even if there might be other reasons than religious bias for temporarily tightening up the vetting of visas.\n\nJustice Robert Jackson once warned that wartime presidents are sometimes forced to operate in a \u201czone of twilight.\u201d But restraining a president on a bias claim based on his remarks on the stump represents an entirely new doctrine \u2014 one without limits.\n\nThink what a Republican judge could do with such a doctrine if, say, someone sued to block the Democrats from funding abortions by citing the leaked anti-Catholic comments of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. Imagine what Rod Serling could make of that.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "type": "article"}
