The parties were originally suing to stop the unlawful sequestration and questioning of travelers. In addition, the plaintiffs wanted the list of names of all detained.\n\nMore than 700 foreign nationals were detained for questioning in airports across the nation in the wake of the controversial order, according to the ACLU.\n\nThe initial legal thrust was filed on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who were held at JFK during the chaos of the first ban.\n\nThe original ban was found unconstitutional, and revised in March. Other district courts across the country, including in Seattle and Hawaii, continue to challenge the ban.\n\nA federal court in Seattle began hearing arguments Monday in the government\u2019s appeal of a July order allowing grandmothers and other family members of those already in the country to enter the United States.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has permitted an abridged version of the ban to stand until it hears the case in October.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-08-29", "type": "article"}
