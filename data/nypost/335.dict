Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.\u201d\n\nKalanick has come under extreme criticism in the past few days for working with the Trump administration. Angry customers started the #deleteUber movement partially based on Kalanick working with Trump and also because the company continued to send cars during a taxi strike that was taking place at JFK Airport \u2014 where numerous refugees were being detained over the weekend \u2014 by failing to turn off its app to prevent dropoffs and pickups there.\n\nA group of Uber drivers started a petition earlier Thursday urging the CEO to step down.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "type": "article"}
