This country hasn\u2019t always welcomed immigrants but \u2014 in the end \u2014 it benefits from them.\n\nAnd immigration is needed now more than ever.\n\nThe Social Security system is the epitome of a pyramid scheme. It stays solvent when more people are working and paying into the system than are getting benefits. It collapses when there aren\u2019t enough payers.\n\nThat\u2019s what is about to happen.\n\nSo not only do we need legal immigrants, we need them to take on-the-books jobs that contribute to not only Social Security, but also to tax receipts.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub. When there aren\u2019t enough jobs to go around \u2014 like today\u2019s situation \u2014 people don\u2019t like competing against newcomers. That\u2019s especially true if the newcomers are here illegally and they might work for less and need free social services.\n\nI agree with President Trump on one important thing: I don\u2019t think anybody wants people to come into this country if they are going to cause trouble.\n\nAnd we can only know who these potential troublemakers are if we thoroughly research their backgrounds.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that innocent people might be delayed in getting into the US, or might not get in at all. But we have to protect the people who are already here.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
