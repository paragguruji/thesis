Roy Blunt, a member of GOP Senate leadership who led Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony, said the president should focus on implementing a more rigorous vetting of foreign visitors.\n\n\u201cMy view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting,\u201d Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIt has been four months since they said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully, we are.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive action to temporarily bar visitors from several Muslim countries from entering the United States has been entangled in several legal challenges.\n\nBut the deadly terrorist attack in London prompted a political reaction by Trump to criticize the court system for holding up his order.\n\n\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough,\u201d Trump said Saturday night from his personal account in his initial Twitter response to the terrifying London Bridge attack. \u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also disagreed with Trump\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cI think that the travel ban is too broad, and that is why it has been rejected by the courts,\u201d Collins told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThe president is right, however, that we need to do a better job of vetting individuals who are coming from war-torn countries into our nation. But I do believe that the very broad ban that he has proposed is not the right way to go.\u201d\n\nThe revised travel ban was to bar travelers for 90 days from six Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia \u2014 and suspend the refugee program for 120 days. The intended goal was to use the pause to roll out enhanced vetting policies to ensure terrorists don\u2019t get into the United States.\n\nOne Trump backer insisted the president was \u201cright\u201d to push for a travel ban and it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d politicians like British Prime Minister Theresa May acted shocked when terrorists took advantage of their \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you keep getting hurt by mosquito bites at some point you decide to start killing mosquitoes,\u201d former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cWhat has to happen across this world is we recognize that when we are being destroyed and devoured by the mosquitoes \u2013 by this evil \u2013 at some point you\u2019ve just got to attack it head on.\u201d\n\nIn response to the attacks, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for better regulations of cyberspace to cut back on the radicalization and recruitment of would-be terrorists.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, who made a fortune in the technology sector, agreed that high-tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google must take on more responsibility.\n\n\u201cI think we do have to reexamine the roles of all of these platform companies \u2026 and recognize there may need to be some responsibility to curate information,\u201d Warner told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nWarner (D-Va.) said tech companies first started to regulate content around child pornography and now have to move on to fake news and terrorism.\n\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s value in the internet, we want to continue to have these connections,\u201d Warner said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also, we\u2019re seeing the dark side.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-04", "type": "article"}
