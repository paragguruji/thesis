Trump is expected to sign the executive order in the coming days.\n\nFour officials told the Associated Press that the decision followed pressure from the Pentagon and State Department, which had urged the White House to reconsider Iraq\u2019s inclusion given its key role in fighting the Islamic State group.\n\nCitizens of six other predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 will remain on the travel ban list, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the order before it is signed. Those bans are effective for 90 days.\n\nThe new order includes other changes as well. The officials said the 12-page document no longer singles out Syrian refugees for an indefinite ban and instead includes them as part of a general, 120-day suspension of new refugee admissions.\n\nThe officials also said the order won\u2019t include any explicit exemption for religious minorities in the countries targeted by the travel ban. Critics had accused the administration of adding such language to help Christians get into the United States while excluding Muslims.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump signed his original executive order in late January. It sparked immediate confusion, panic and outrage as some travelers were detained in US airports before being sent back overseas and others were barred from boarding flights at foreign airports.\n\nThe government initially blocked US green card holders before offering those legal residents special permission to come into the country. It finally decided the order didn\u2019t apply to them.\n\nThe State Department provisionally revoked roughly 60,000 valid visas in all, before a federal judge in Washington state blocked the government from carrying out the ban. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.\n\nsee also Trump defends travel ban during first speech to Congress President Trump defended his travel ban Tuesday at a Joint...\n\nUnder the revised order, officials said, all existing visas will be honored.\n\nIn his first address to a joint session of Congress, Trump on Tuesday evening defended his effort.\n\n\u201cWe will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those who would do us harm,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Trump signed the original order, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi repudiated the ban and said he would consider reciprocal measures. Many Iraqi lawmakers urged the government to ban Americans from Iraq in response, despite the potential effects that might have on the anti-IS fight.\n\nAl-Abadi then met with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Baghdad this month and underscored the US-Iraqi partnership. And Mattis walked back comments made by Trump, suggesting that Americans could get another chance to seize Iraqi oil as compensation for its military efforts there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in Iraq to seize anybody\u2019s oil,\u201d Mattis told reporters on that trip. Al-Abadi also met with Vice President Mike Pence in Munich earlier this month, where the two publicly discussed ways of strengthening cooperation.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s changes to the immigration order follow a report by intelligence analysts at the Homeland Security Department, which found insufficient evidence that citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries posed a terror threat to the United States. A draft of the analysis was obtained last week by the AP.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-01", "type": "article"}
