She would not provide the passengers\u2019 names, nationalities or other details.\n\nThe company earlier had reported that 21 passengers had been turned away, but then corrected its count.\n\nThe passengers were from seven Muslim-majority countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
