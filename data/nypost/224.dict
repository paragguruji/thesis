And when it comes to Preet Bharara\u2019s exit from the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s Office, all the media narratives are pretty much the same.\n\nTo wit, Bharara was an independent and crusading prosecutor who was fired by President Trump for one of two reasons: Trump wanted to protect himself from possible prosecution or was guilty of gross incompetence. Either way, Bharara was the hero and Trump the villain.\n\nThe only wrench in the nursery rhyme is that other facts point to other possible conclusions. Let\u2019s review a few of the inconvenient ones, starting in late November.\n\nReporting that Bharara met with then-President-elect Trump and agreed to stay on his job, the New York Times gave readers an extra nugget. While most news accounts said that Sen. Chuck Schumer urged Trump to keep Bharara, the Times, citing an anonymous source, added a detail: \u201cMr. Trump also asked Mr. Schumer how best to reach Mr. Bharara, and the senator provided Mr. Trump with Mr. Bharara\u2019s direct line.\u201d\n\nWell, then, since the Senate minority leader had a direct line to the federal prosecutor in his home district, it is reasonable to assume that Schumer used that line on occasion. Did they discuss cases? Politics?\n\nNeither would be surprising. Bharara had worked for Schumer in the Senate, and Schumer had recommended that President Barack Obama elevate his young staffer to US attorney, which Obama did in 2009.\n\nAnd now, thanks again to Schumer\u2019s recommendation to Trump, Bharara would get to keep his lofty perch despite the tradition of each new president replacing federal prosecutors with his own appointees.\n\nCNN even reported that Trump offered to keep Bharara on as a personal favor to Schumer, hoping it would help break the partisan ice in Washington.\n\nsee also Preet Bharara fired after refusing to resign Crooked pols, shady Wall Streeters and America-hating terrorists had reason...\n\nIn any event, it\u2019s certain that Bharara owed his last two jobs to Schumer, the ultimate political animal, and yet we are to believe that Bharara was so offended by even the mere hint of politics that he refused Trump\u2019s order to resign, and demanded to be fired.\n\nCount me as disappointed that Trump did not keep Bharara at the Southern District long enough to finish the extended probe of Mayor Bill de Blasio, the trial of people close to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Anthony Weiner child pornography investigation.\n\nBut Bharara\u2019s political grandstanding on the way out the door is doubly disappointing. In an instant, he went from white knight to a member of the Democrats\u2019 anti-Trump resistance movement.\n\nHe revealed his sudden change of heart when he tweeted that \u201cnow I know what the Moreland Commission must have felt like,\u201d an obvious reference to Cuomo prematurely closing a public-corruption panel he had appointed. Bharara had fumed at Cuomo and seized the panel\u2019s files, which he used as a starting point to convict Albany\u2019s top two legislative leaders. By mentioning the Moreland panel now, Bharara seemed to be hinting that he, too, had been fired because he was getting too close to a sacred cow.\n\nOf course, that would also mean Trump had fired 45 other prosecutors the same day just to protect that sacred cow.\n\nBharara also let it be known, first through anonymous leaks, that Trump had called him the day before the firing. But the immaculate prosecutor, believing the call was inappropriate under federal rules, refused to take the call and talked to the Justice Department instead.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if it was inappropriate for Bharara to talk to Trump in March, why was it appropriate for him to meet with the president-elect in Trump Tower in November about keeping the job? On the surface, there\u2019s no material difference, especially because Bharara concedes he doesn\u2019t know why Trump called him last week, though he doubts the White House version that the president was calling to thank him for his service.\n\nI have saluted Bharara as a one-man wrecking crew against political corruption, but I\u2019m left with the feeling that he developed a case of Comey-itis. Like FBI Director Jim Comey, Bharara acted as if he was too big to fire.\n\nBy refusing to follow the traditional practice of submitting his resignation when the president requested it \u2014 that\u2019s what it means to serve \u201cat the pleasure of the president\u201d \u2014 he challenged Trump\u2019s constitutional authority. He was out of bounds.\n\nWhat was his end game? Was the Manhattan outpost of the Justice Department going rogue and would no longer be accountable to anyone except Preet Bharara? Or was he auditioning for his next gig?\n\nBecause of his defiance, speculation is swirling that Bharara will soon enter politics. I\u2019d say he already has.\n\nDeport foes in left field\n\nThe Associated Press recently distributed a story about training sessions to help illegal immigrants avoid deportation. The sessions are being held across the country and are offered by liberal advocacy groups such as Make the Road in New York, which are spreading fears of mass deportation under President Trump.\n\nsee also Trump signs revised immigration ban WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed a new executive...\n\nAmong the advocates\u2019 advice: Don\u2019t open the door even a peek if immigration officials come knocking. Tell them your name and nothing else. Don\u2019t sign anything and never show any fake documents, lest you get into serious trouble.\n\nYet nowhere in the story is there any indication that the advocacy groups know whether the immigrants they are training to avoid the law are also guilty of serious crimes, including violent ones. Without knowing or wanting to know, the groups could be helping to shield dangerous felons.\n\nThat\u2019s reckless and irresponsible. Not all illegal immigrants are equal, and reasonable vetting of those getting the training is in order.\n\nTo argue otherwise is to admit that Trump Derangement Syndrome is causing the left to go completely nuts.\n\n\n\nIvanka\u2019s smooth saleing\n\nAfter anti-Trumpers threatened boycotts, Nordstrom and other retailers dropped Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line. In response, supporters of the president waged a campaign to buy Ivanka\u2019s products online and at other outlets.\n\nThe results are in and so is the winner \u2014 February sales soared by 346 percent, the company reports, with some categories doing better than ever.\n\nMy humble suggestion is that Trump show her appreciation by naming a new perfume after her father\u2019s most loyal backers: Deplorable. It would sell like hotcakes and carry the sweet smell of revenge.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "type": "article"}
