Ali Latif, whose unit works closely with U.S.-led coalition forces in the fight against IS in Mosul. \u201cI heard the news, that many people were stopped in airports, why would (the United States) do this?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the foreign relations committee of Iraq\u2019s parliament is asking the government to impose a similar visa ban on Americans trying to enter Iraq, according to member Hassan Shwerid.\n\nInfluential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has also spoken out against the ban, suggesting all Americans should be forced out of Iraq in retaliation, according to a statement from his office.\n\nIn the more than three months since the operation to retake Mosul was officially launched, Latif says he\u2019s lost six close friends in the fight against the militants. Moving forward he doesn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s order will dramatically alter the fight against IS, but he says it\u2019s already caused mild friction with his U.S. counterparts.\n\n\u201cThis (decision) it makes us feel a little bad,\u201d he said.\n\nDeeper inside Mosul a unit of Iraqi soldiers admitted they hadn\u2019t heard the news.\n\n\u201cHave they stopped giving visas to Iraqi people? Does this mean we cannot enter America? Why?\u201d a man yelled from the top of a supply truck.\n\n\u201cHonestly I love Trump!\u201d said another Iraqi special forces solider, Sgt. Maj. Diar Al-Khair.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our doctors and professors to keep going to another country and make it greater than our own,\u201d he said.\n\nIraq has suffered from severe brain-drain for over a decade as many of the country\u2019s educated elite have fled the instability in the country that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nState media reported that Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II will visit Washington on Monday. The king will meet with administration officials and members of Congress, according to state media who did not mention a White House visit.\n\nPro-Western Jordan isn\u2019t among the countries slapped with the travel ban, but views refugee resettlement to the U.S. and other countries as a way of easing its own burden; Jordan hosts more than 650,000 displaced Syrians.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
