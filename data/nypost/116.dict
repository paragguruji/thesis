Prince, once a standout at Tennessee, are stranded in Dubai, where they were on a team-funded vacation.\n\nOn Friday, Trump signed an order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 including Iran \u2014 from entering the U.S. Iran followed in turn by banning Americans from entering its borders. Now the two players are stuck, unable to return to play for Azad University Tehran.\n\n\u201cAt the moment they are stranded,\u201d their agent, Eric Fleisher, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real hardship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthere is very little optimism\u201d about getting the two back into Iran to play, as the players stand to lose a lot of money \u2014 \u201csix figures,\u201d Fleisher said.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for clarity from the team,\u201d Fleisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. It doesn\u2019t look like they can finish the season in Iran. It\u2019s not good to be out of a job. Secondarily, all their things are in Iran. They can\u2019t go back and get them. It\u2019s been difficult.\u201d\n\nJones is a center who played for the Aggies from 2004-08, then played for the Rockets\u2019 Summer League team in 2008. He has played all over the globe since, and this was both his and Prince\u2019s first year in the Iranian Basketball Super League.\n\nPrince \u2014 a cousin of Tayshaun Prince \u2014 played at Arizona from 2005-07 then transferred to Tennessee. The Mississippi native has traveled the world, playing in China, Turkey and Poland among other far-reaching countries.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
