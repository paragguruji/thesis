They peppered Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall with questions about whether they could consider Trump\u2019s campaign statements calling for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., with one judge asking if there was anything other than \u201cwillful blindness\u201d that would prevent them from doing so.\n\nMonday\u2019s arguments mark the second time Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict immigration from certain Muslim-majority nations have reached the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.\n\nAfter Trump issued his initial travel ban on a Friday in late January, bringing chaos and protests to airports around the country, a Seattle judge blocked its enforcement nationwide \u2014 a decision that was unanimously upheld by a three-judge 9th Circuit panel.\n\nThe president then rewrote his executive order, rather than appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in March, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu blocked the new version from taking effect, citing what he called \u201csignificant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\u201d in Trump\u2019s campaign statements.\n\n\u201cAgain, in this court, the President claims a nearly limitless power to make immigration policy that is all but immune from judicial review,\u201d Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin wrote to the 9th Circuit. \u201cAgain, he must be checked.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s lawyers are seeking to persuade the judges that the lower court\u2019s decision is \u201cfundamentally wrong,\u201d and that the president\u2019s order falls squarely within his duty to secure the nation\u2019s borders. The order as written is silent on religion, and neither Hawaii nor its co-plaintiff, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, has standing to sue, they say \u2014 arguments that were rejected in the lower court.\n\nThe travel ban cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court, but that would likely be cemented if the 4th and 9th Circuits reach differing conclusions about its legality. Because of how the courts chose to proceed, a full slate of 13 judges heard the 4th Circuit arguments last week, while just three, all appointees of President Bill Clinton, will sit in Seattle.\n\nFor that reason \u2014 with the possibility for myriad concurring or dissenting opinions \u2014 it could take the 4th Circuit longer to rule, noted Carl Tobias, a law professor at University of Richmond law school in Virginia.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "type": "article"}
