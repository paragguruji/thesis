We\u2019re getting into the days of, now we\u2019re judging people by their religion \u2014 trying to keep Muslims out,\u201d Van Gundy told reporters on Monday in Boston, sharing his opinions on the order, which temporarily suspends immigration from seven majority Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cNone of those seven nations have been responsible for an American death, but we\u2019re barring everybody,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just playing to people\u2019s fears and prejudices and everything else, and we\u2019re getting back to the days of putting the Japanese in relocation camps and Hitler registering the Jews. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed, and it\u2019s just fear-mongering and playing to a certain base of people that have some built-in prejudices that aren\u2019t fair.\u201d\n\nVan Gundy previously lambasted Trump the day after his election victory, calling him \u201cbrazenly racist\u201d and \u201cmisogynistic\u201d and blaming his supporters for having \u201cthrown a good part of our population under the bus.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons play at Boston on Monday night.\n\nWith AP", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
