The judge declined to stay the order, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted immediately.\n\nThe challenge was brought by the state of Washington and later joined by the state of Minnesota. The Seattle judge ruled that the states have legal standing to sue, which could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful day for the rule of law in this country,\u201d said Washington state solicitor general Noah Purcell.\n\nThe decision came on a day that attorneys from four states were in courts challenging Trump\u2019s executive order. Trump\u2019s administration justified the action on national security grounds, but opponents labeled it an unconstitutional order targeting people based on religious beliefs.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a federal judge in Boston on Friday declined to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the United States from certain countries despite being barred by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order.\n\nAlso on Friday in Virginia, a federal judge ordered the White House to provide a list of all people stopped from entering the United States by the travel ban.\n\nThe State Department said on Friday that fewer than 60,000 visas previously issued to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen had been invalidated as a result of the order. That disclosure followed media reports that government lawyers were citing a figure of 100,000.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia ordered the federal government to give the state a list by Thursday of \u201call persons who have been denied entry to or removed from the United States.\u201d\n\nThe state of Hawaii on Friday joined the challenge to the order, filing a lawsuit alleging that the order is unconstitutional and asking the court to block the order across the country.\n\nThe new Republican president\u2019s order signed on Jan. 27 triggered chaos at U.S. airports last weekend. Some travelers abroad were turned back from flights into the United States, crowds of hundreds of people packed into arrival areas to protest and legal objections were filed across the country.\n\nThe order also temporarily stopped the entry of all refugees into the country and indefinitely halted the settlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nOn Friday the Department of Homeland Security issued additional clarification of the order, stating that there were no plans to extend it beyond the seven countries. The DHS also reiterated that the ban did not apply to permanent residents, or green card holders, and some others, such as those who have helped the U.S. military.\n\nIn the Boston case, U.S. District Judge Nathan Gorton denied the request, after expressing skepticism during oral arguments about a civil rights group\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s order represented religious discrimination.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["stay", "blocks", "extend", "ban", "challenge", "immigration", "seattle", "judge", "state", "united", "states", "trumps", "countries", "refused", "federal", "boston", "order", "washington"], "summary": "A federal judge in Seattle on Friday granted a nationwide temporary restraining order blocking U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent action barring nationals from seven countries from entering the United States.\nThe judge declined to stay the order, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted immediately.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful day for the rule of law in this country,\u201d said Washington state solicitor general Noah Purcell.\nAlso on Friday in Virginia, a federal judge ordered the White House to provide a list of all people stopped from entering the United States by the travel ban.\nIn the Boston case, U.S. District Judge Nathan Gorton denied the request, after expressing skepticism during oral arguments about a civil rights group\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s order represented religious discrimination."}
