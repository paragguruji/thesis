We are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a [court] decision [and] we think [we] will be very successful with and shouldn\u2019t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. You\u2019ll be seeing that sometime next week. In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and I have no doubt we\u2019ll win that particular case.\u201d\n\nTrump also alluded to unspecified threats he had learned about in the three weeks of his presidency \u2014 and vowed to prevent any attacks on the US.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been president, which is just for a very short period of time, I have learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president,\u201d Trump said during an appearance in the East Wing of the White House with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe.\n\n\u201cThere are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen. We\u2019ll be going forward and continuing to do things to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly.\u201d\n\nThe president also repeated that the US would not allow dangerous people into the country, but that others would be welcome.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country. It will remain that way during my administration.\u201d\n\nTrump and Abe were heading later Friday to Trump\u2019s Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a weekend of meetings and golf.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["trump", "additional", "security", "immigration", "win", "tremendous", "court", "rapidly", "going", "country", "safe", "come", "president", "happen", "steps", "allow"], "summary": "\u201cWe are going to keep our country safe.\nWe are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country.\nWe\u2019ll be going forward and continuing to do things to make our country safe.\nWe will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country."}
