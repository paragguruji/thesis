The order also put an indefinite hold on Syrian refugees.\n\nTrump administration officials have said the issue might go to the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump\u2019s next Saturday morning tweet discussed reports that his promised Mexican border wall will cost $21.6 billion.\n\n\u201cI am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!\u201d he pledged at 8:24 a.m.\n\nTrump is spending the weekend in Palm Beach, FL with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife. \u201cThey are a wonderful couple!\u201d he tweeted.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "type": "article"}
