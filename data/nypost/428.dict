At least 10,000 demonstrators to the streets of Manhattan on Sunday, according to the Mayor de Blasio\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s executive order is unconstitutional, illegal, un-American and stupid!\u201d US Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan/Brooklyn) told protesters Sunday. \u201cThis is meant to be a ban on Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe New York protesters chanted, \u201cWhen refugees are under attack, stand up, fight back!\u201d \u201cHey Trump, hey [Vice President Mike] Pence, we\u2019re all immigrants here!\u201d and \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go!\u201d\n\nThe most popular signs were included \u201cThe president is un-American,\u201d \u201cTiny hands, huuuuge mistake\u201d and \u201cNo ban, no wall,\u201d in reference to Trump\u2019s multibillion-dollar plans to beef up walls across the US-Mexico border.\n\nAnother poignant sign held by a protester had a picture of the Statue of Liberty and the words: \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d\n\nThe protesters began at Battery Park before trekking north to Foley Square, near US District Court and federal Department of Homeland Security offices.\n\nAdditional reporting by David K.
