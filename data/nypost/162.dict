Since the March 12 agreement with Iraq regarding deportees, eight Iraqi nationals have been removed to Iraq.\n\nsee also Trump signs revised immigration ban WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed a new executive...\n\nDozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit were among those targeted in the immigration sweeps, some of whom fear they will be killed if deported to their home country, immigration attorneys and family members said.\n\n\u201cIt is very worrisome that ICE has signaled its intention to remove Chaldean Christians to Iraq where their safety not only cannot be guaranteed, but where they face persecution and death for their religious beliefs,\u201d Martin Manna, president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nKurdish Iraqis also were picked up in Nashville, Tennessee, according to attorneys, activists and family members.\n\nAt least some of those arrested came to the United States as children, got in trouble and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and activists. Some have lived in the United States so long, they no longer speak Arabic.\n\nAn Iraqi official previously said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with US authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-15", "type": "article"}
