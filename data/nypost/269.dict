That order is currently on hold.\n\n\u201cThe fear coursing through immigrant homes and the native-born Americans who love immigrants as friends and family is palpable,\u201d Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement. \u201cReports of raids in immigrant communities are a grave concern.\u201d\n\nThe enforcement actions took place in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and surrounding areas, said David Marin, director of enforcement and removal for the Los Angeles field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nOnly five of 161 people arrested in Southern California would not have been enforcement priorities under the Obama administration, he said.\n\nThe agency did not release a total number of detainees. The Atlanta office, which covers three states, arrested 200 people, Bryan Cox, a spokesman for the office, said. The 161 arrests in the Los Angeles area were made in a region that included seven highly populated counties, Marin said.\n\nMarin called the five-day operation an \u201cenforcement surge.\u201d\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, he said that such actions were routine, pointing to one last summer in Los Angeles under former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThe rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that\u2019s all false and that\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible,\u201d Marin said. \u201cReports like that create a panic.\u201d\n\nHe said that of the people arrested in Southern California, only 10 did not have criminal records. Of those, five had prior deportation orders.\n\nMichael Kagan, a professor of immigration law at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said immigration advocates are concerned that the arrests could signal the beginning of more aggressive enforcement and increased deportations under Trump.\n\n\u201cIt sounds as if the majority are people who would have been priorities under Obama as well,\u201d Kagan said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut the others may indicate the first edge of a new wave of arrests and deportations.\u201d\n\nTrump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime, removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors, Kagan said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "type": "article"}
