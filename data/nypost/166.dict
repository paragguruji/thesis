Inouye International Airport after a 28-hour journey that began in Lebanon, the\n\nAssociated Press reported on Sunday, citing Ismail Elshikh, her son-in-law.\n\nElshikh, the imam of a Honolulu mosque, is a plaintiff in Hawaii\u2019s challenge to the ban restricting travel from six mainly Muslim countries that is being challenged in the courts.\n\nThe suit says Trump\u2019s ban prevented her from visiting Hawaii and seeing his five children, the wire service reported.\n\nTwo of his children have never met Yahia, who last visited Hawaii in 2005, Elshikh said.\n\n\u201cWithout the lawsuit, we couldn\u2019t get the visa. Without this challenge, my children would not have been reunited with their grandma,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cI still feel sadness for those who are still affected by the Muslim ban, who are not as lucky as my family.\u201d\n\nA federal court in Seattle is expected to hear arguments later this month in the government\u2019s appeal of a July ruling that allows grandmothers and other family members of those in the US to enter the country.\n\nThe US Supreme Court allowed a scaled-down version of the ban to take effect until it hears the case in October, and the justices exempted visa applicants from the ban if they could prove a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship with a US citizen.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-08-13", "type": "article"}
