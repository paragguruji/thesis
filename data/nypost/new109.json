A terrible decision,\u201d the president tweeted at 4:44 p.m.\n\nThe White House promised an emergency appeal of Robart\u2019s order but had not done so as of late Saturday. It said he was readying one.\n\nThose rushing to finish their travel plans before the appeal was filed was Fordham University law student Farimah Kashkooli, 33, whose ailing daughter was trapped in Tehran, Iran, by Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAlma Kashkooli, 11, who can barely talk or walk and is prone to seizures, was set to undergo eye surgery and other lifesaving procedures in Pittsburgh last week.\n\nMom Farimah Kashkooli had feared that leaving New York to retrieve her daughter would leave her stuck overseas, unable to return.\n\nBut Saturday, she revived her plans. A relative planned to bring the girl to Istanbul, from where Kaskhooli would bring her to New York. She hopes to be back in the United States by Tuesday, before any further legal action is taken on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just keeping our fingers crossed and wishing for the best and hoping time is on our side,\u201d said her lawyer, Shaimaa Hussein.\n\nThe visas of about 60,000 foreigners were \u201cprovisionally revoked\u201d to comply with Trump\u2019s order. The Jan. 27 order also stopped the processing of refugees from Syria.\n\nWith his ruling Friday, Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2004, cleared nearly all those visa holders to travel.\n\nOn Saturday, officials in the State and Homeland Security departments put Robart\u2019s order into effect.\n\nDubai-based Emirates Airline allowed those whose visas were restored to board its US-bound flights. Its main rivals, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, issued similar instructions.\n\nIraqi Airways flights from Baghdad to Istanbul, Cairo and Dubai were booked solid Saturday afternoon, said an airline official. Many of those on the flights are headed to the United States, the official said.\n\nIbrahim Bahr Uloom, a member of Iraq\u2019s parliament, praised \u00adRobart.\n\n\u201cThe US justice system is better than Iraqi diplomacy,\u201d Uloom said. \u201cToday we thank the American judiciary.\u201d\n\nSome airlines warned customers to hurry up. Germany\u2019s Luft\u00adhansa warned that US rules could change \u201cat any time.\u201d\n\nYemeni citizens in Djibouti, a country on the Horn of Africa, were not initially allowed to fly to the United States, according to a report. Also, a group of 140\n\nSomali refugees whose American resettlement was blocked by the travel ban were sent back to their refugee camp in Kenya.\n\nYemeni national Ammar Alnajjar, a green-card holder who attends Southwest Tennesee Community College in Memphis, was visiting his fianc\u00e9e in Uzbekistan when the judge overturned Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAlnajjar paid $1,000 to return as soon as possible. He arrived at JFK Airport Saturday aboard a Turkish Airlines flight. Officials held him for an hour and checked his phone and e-mail.\n\n\u201cI got to study. I got to do some work,\u201d said Alnajjar, who said he fled civil war in Yemen and moved to the United States from Turkey in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m Muslim. I\u2019m proud of it. \u2018Islam\u2019 means peace.\u201d\n\nIranians were allowed on US-bound flights, and by midday, some had made it to Boston\u2019s Logan Airport.\n\n\u201cPeople are being allowed to board from Tehran,\u201d Sirine Shebaya, a lawyer representing Washington, DC-bound travelers, told The Washington Post.\n\nTrump, on a weekend retreat in Palm Beach, Fla., said Robart\u2019s \u00adorder endangers America.\n\n\u201cWhen a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot, come in & out, especially for reasons of safety & security \u2014 big trouble!\u201d he tweeted at 7:59 a.m.\n\n\u201cInteresting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it\u2019s death & destruction!\u201d he said at 8:06 a.m.\n\nA former Iraqi official backed Trump\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\u201cFor the first time we have an American president that speaks about these countries and tells the truth about what they are really like,\u201d Kamran Karadaghi, a former chief-of-staff to the Iraqi president, told The Sunday Times of London.\n\nThe stage was set for Robart\u2019s decision when Washington state and Minnesota sued the feds in Seattle last week, claiming Trump\u2019s executive order was an \u201cillegal\u201d action that separated families and damaged the economy.\n\nIn his decision, Robart, 69, noted the importance of America\u2019s three branches of government and the concept of separation of government powers.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mary Kay Linge, Isabel Vincent, Melissa Klein and Post Wire Services", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "ban", "holders", "scramble", "judge", "united", "states", "trumps", "president", "country", "order", "reinstated", "washington", "visa"], "summary": "They were hoping to get across the Atlantic Ocean before any federal judge reinstates Trump\u2019s travel ban.\nShe hopes to be back in the United States by Tuesday, before any further legal action is taken on the issue.\nThe visas of about 60,000 foreigners were \u201cprovisionally revoked\u201d to comply with Trump\u2019s order.\nMany of those on the flights are headed to the United States, the official said.\nAlso, a group of 140Somali refugees whose American resettlement was blocked by the travel ban were sent back to their refugee camp in Kenya."}
