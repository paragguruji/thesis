A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 10.\n\nBut the justices said the ban couldn\u2019t include people who have a \u201cbona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d They did not specify which relationships qualified.\n\nThe Trump administration interpreted it to mean parents, children, spouses, siblings, parents-in-law and sons- and daughters-in-law but not grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins.\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii found the administration had defined the relationship too narrowly.\n\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Judge Derrick Watson wrote in July. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court upheld that decision.\n\nThe administration did not challenge that aspect of the ban.\n\nTrump\u2019s travel restrictions from the mainly Muslim countries has been caught up in the courts since he implemented his first executive order in January.\n\nAirports erupted in chaos as visitors to the United States were detained and some even pulled from planes as immigration advocates led protests across the country.\n\nOpponents challenged the order in court, saying that it was unconstitutional and that the president overstepped his executive authority.\n\nWith Wire Services", "authors": ["September"], "publish_date": "2017-09-11", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["ruling", "travel", "courts", "trump", "restores", "temporarily", "supreme", "ban", "appeals", "court", "trumps", "order", "administration"], "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday granted a request from the Trump administration and temporarily blocked a federal appeals court\u2019s ruling that placed restrictions on the president\u2019s travel ban.\nsee also Trump wants Supreme Court to restore refugee travel ban The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to...Kennedy\u2019s order puts the San Francisco-based appeals court\u2019s ruling on hold until the parties challenging the ban can submit written arguments to the court by Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Supreme Court in June allowed that ban to continue while it considers arguments over whether the action is constitutional.\nThe Trump administration interpreted it to mean parents, children, spouses, siblings, parents-in-law and sons- and daughters-in-law but not grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins.\nOpponents challenged the order in court, saying that it was unconstitutional and that the president overstepped his executive authority."}
