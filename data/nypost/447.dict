That\u2019s all with the blessing of their boss thanks to social justice benefits and paid time off work policies that are growing in popularity.\n\nAt San Francisco marketing firm Traction, social justice benefits take the form of two so-called \u201cDays of Action\u201d a year.\n\n\u201cThey can take part in a protest, they can volunteer for a cause that is meaningful to them,\u201d says CEO Adam Kleinberg. \u201cCivic engagement is a foundation of our democracy, and companies should encourage it.\u201d\n\nKleinberg says that while he\u2019s liberal, Traction\u2019s new policy is neutral: so long as it\u2019s not a group that promotes violence, such as the Ku Klux Klan, his 50 employees can support whatever political group or cause they want. They must first get approval from management and submit a request for the time off.\n\n\u201cIf someone wanted to participate in a pro-life rally,\u201d says Kleinberg, \u201cthey are absolutely welcome to do that. This is not about the partners at Traction promoting our agenda, it\u2019s about having a broader view of democracy, and encouraging people to be engaged.\u201d\n\nBut in the famously left-leaning Bay Area, conservative activists don\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThey want, basically, a harder left turn than we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d says Howard Epstein, vice chair of communications for the San Francisco Republican Party. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going political, you\u2019re going to discourage some people from going to your place of business.\u201d\n\nIt is a risk: Consumers opposed to an official endorsement of protest culture might spend their money elsewhere. When news of Traction\u2019s \u201cDay of Action\u201d benefit spread, Kleinberg was the target of a backlash and calls for a boycott.\n\n\u201cTraction has been called everything from fascists, to socialists, to communists, to libtards, candya\u2014s. I\u2019m not quite sure what being a candya\u2013 is, but if being candya\u2014s is what it takes for Traction to inspire change, we\u2019re willing to own that.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, outdoor apparel maker Patagonia had a similar stance.\n\n\u201cWe hire activists \u2026 who are incredibly passionate about the environment. And, at times, protesting is part of that passion,\u201d said Dean Carter, vice president of human resources. \u201cIt all fits in with the company\u2019s greater mission to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.\u201d\n\nSeveral big corporations are also responding to their worker\u2019s desire to advocate. Facebook told its employees they could take paid time off for May Day rallies which, in many cases, were largely about defending immigrant rights. Earlier this year, Comcast gave its workers paid time off to protest Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\nMost companies give their workers time off to vote, but \u201cthis is different \u2013 this is going to a new level,\u201d said Scott Dobroski, community expert with employment firm Glassdoor.\n\nA recent Glassdoor survey found more than half of employees believe they should have time off to advocate for social change, regardless of their politics.\n\n\u201cMany employers,\u201d Dobroski said, \u201care taking note that social change and positive action matters to employees \u2013 both in and out of the workplace.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-28", "type": "article"}
