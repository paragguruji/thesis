It was halted when a Seattle judge slapped a temporary restraining order on the executive order, and the restraining order was upheld by a higher court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cOne of the big differences that you\u2019re going to see in the executive order is that is going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn\u2019t exist previously,\u201d Miller said.\n\nA panel of appeals court judges attacked the claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism, and ruled that the prohibition did not enhance national security.\n\nBut Miller continued to sound that argument: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a serious problem in our country of terrorism, radicalization and serious problems of people joining ISIS, joining terror groups, joining al Qaeda and committing or attempting to commit acts of crime and terror against our nation.\u201d\n\nHe said the new executive order will be coming \u201cvery soon.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-22", "type": "article"}
