Trump\u2019s administration justified the action on national security grounds, but opponents labeled it an unconstitutional order targeting people based on religious beliefs.\n\nEarlier on Friday in Virginia, a federal judge ordered the White House to provide a list of all people stopped from entering the United States by the travel ban.\n\nThe State Department said on Friday that fewer than 60,000 visas previously issued to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen had been invalidated as a result of the order. That disclosure followed media reports that government lawyers were citing a figure of 100,000.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, ordered the federal government to give the state a list by Thursday of \u201call persons who have been denied entry to or removed from the United States.\u201d\n\nAt Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, at least four college students from Iran and Iraq who had previously been blocked from entering the United States by the order, arrived with new visas on Friday, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nThe new Republican president\u2019s order signed on Jan. 27 triggered chaos at U.S. airports last weekend. Some travelers abroad were turned back from flights into the United States, crowds of hundreds of people packed into arrival areas to protest and legal objections were filed across the country.\n\nThe order also temporarily stopped the entry of all refugees into the country and indefinitely halted the settlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe state of Hawaii on Friday joined the challenge to the order, with officials saying they were suing to block enforcement of the travel ban. Federal judges in Boston and Seattle also were weighing arguments.\n\nIn the Boston case, U.S. District Judge Nathan Gorton expressed skepticism during oral arguments about a civil rights group\u2019s claim that Trump\u2019s order represented religious discrimination.\n\nCivil-rights advocates called to extend a restraining order issued early on Sunday that for seven days blocks the detention or removal of approved refugees, visa holders, and legal permanent U.S. residents who entered from the seven countries. The judge ultimately denied the request.\n\n\u201cWhere does it say Muslim countries?\u201d Gorton asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU.\n\nSegal responded, \u201cIf your honor\u2019s question is, \u2018Does the word \u2018Muslim\u2019 make a profound presence in this executive order?,\u2019 my answer is that it doesn\u2019t. But the president described what he was going to do as a Muslim ban and then he proceeded to carry it out.\u201d\n\nGorton shot back, \u201cAm I to take the words of an executive at any point before or after election as a part of that executive order?\u201d\n\nTrump has told a Christian broadcaster that Syrian Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status.\n\nIn Seattle, the states of Washington and Minnesota were together asking a judge to suspend the entire policy nationwide, which would represent the broadest ruling to date against Trump\u2019s directive.\n\nShould the Seattle judge rule that Washington state and Minnesota have legal standing to sue, it could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
