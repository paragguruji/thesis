See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Trump said during a morning tweetstorm.\n\n\u201cOut of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the \u2018ban\u2019 case and now the \u2018sanctuary\u2019 case is brought in the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this \u2018judge shopping!\u2019 Messy system,\u201d he continued.\n\nCalifornia US District Judge William Orrick on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction barring any attempt to implement Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 executive order.\n\nOrrick quoted Trump to support his decision to block the executive order, which calls for withholding funding from \u201csanctuary cities\u201d like the Big Apple that do not cooperate with US immigration officials.\n\nTrump called his order a \u201cweapon\u201d against communities that disagree with his preferred immigration policy, Orrick said.\n\nThe judge also cited a February interview in which he said the Trump threatened to cut off funding to California, saying the state \u201cin many ways is out of control.\u201d\n\nThe first comment was proof that the administration intended the executive order to apply broadly to all sorts of federal funding, not just a relatively small amount of grant money as the Department of Justice had argued, Orrick said.\n\nThe second statement showed the two California governments that sued to block the order \u2014 San Francisco and Santa Clara County \u2014 had good reason to believe they would be targeted, Orrick said.\n\nOrrick\u2019s ruling was another immigration policy setback for the embattled administration as it approaches its 100th day in office Saturday amid Trump\u2019s lowest approval ratings in modern presidential history.\n\nThe sanctuary city order was among a slew of immigration measures Trump signed in January \u2014 including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and a directive calling for a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nTrump\u2019s words also were cited by federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii, who last month blocked his revised ban on new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nUS District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii and US District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland said his comments supported the allegation that the ban was aimed at Muslims.\n\nOrrick\u2019s preliminary injunction against the sanctuary cities order will stay in place while the lawsuits by San Francisco and Santa Clara wend their way through court.\n\nThe government hasn\u2019t cut off any funding yet or declared any communities sanctuary cities. But the Justice Department sent letters last week advising communities to prove they are in compliance.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus described the ruling as another example of the \u201c9th Circuit going bananas.\u201d\n\nThe administration has often criticized the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Orrick does not sit on that court but his district is in the territory of the appeals court, which has ruled against one version of Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\n\u201cThe idea that an agency can\u2019t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these moneys are spent is something that will be overturned eventually, and we will win at the Supreme Court level at some point,\u201d Priebus said.\n\nWith Post Wires", "authors": ["April"], "publish_date": "2017-04-26", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["executive", "rulings", "trump", "orders", "ban", "ridiculous", "goes", "blocking", "judge", "court", "immigration", "sanctuary", "funding", "trumps", "order", "orrick"], "summary": "President Trump lashed out early Wednesday against a federal judge\u2019s ruling blocking an executive order that could deny billions of dollars to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2013 vowing to take his fight to the Supreme Court.\nsee also Judge blocks Trump's sanctuary city order A federal judge on Tuesday dealt another blow to President...\u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings.\nSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Trump said during a morning tweetstorm.\nCalifornia US District Judge William Orrick on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction barring any attempt to implement Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 executive order.\nTrump called his order a \u201cweapon\u201d against communities that disagree with his preferred immigration policy, Orrick said."}
