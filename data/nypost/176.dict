That\u2019s how markets work, even if the architects of ObamaCare refused to believe it.\u201d\n\nLaw prof: SCOTUS Will Uphold Most of Travel Ban\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to allow parts of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to go forward \u2014 even before hearing oral arguments \u2014 suggests that \u201ca majority of justices . . . will uphold the most important parts of the ban,\u201d predicts Alan Dershowitz at Fox News. In fact, he says, the justices \u201cdrew the distinction I have been urging\u201d: that any ban be limited to \u201cindividuals who do not have a green card or other connections\u201d with the US. Such people have \u201cno constitutional right to come into our country and he can be excluded for virtually any reason.\u201d And \u201ca ban that applies to countries that have a serious problem vetting potential terrorists would be valid, even if all of those countries had Muslim majorities.\u201d\n\nCulture watch: Why Hollywood Couldn\u2019t Elect GA Dem\n\nCelebs \u201care famous for making themselves heard during presidential elections, especially on behalf of Democrats,\u201d allowing them to \u201cfeel like power players,\u201d notes Jay Caruso at Acculturated. They rarely get involved in congressional races, but couldn\u2019t resist one billed as a referendum on President Trump. Yet despite campaigning from Alyssa Milano, radio ads featuring Samuel L. Jackson and a social-media flurry from Sarah Silverman, Debra Messing, Mark Ruffalo and others, Georgia Republican Karen Handel easily defeated the Hollywood-backed Democrat, Jon Ossoff. It comes down to culture: \u201cHollywood stars may wield power and influence on the red carpet, but thankfully, they don\u2019t have much impact on the sidewalks of the Atlanta suburbs.\u201d\n\nFrom the left: Time for Some Media Self-Examination\n\nFor \u201cthose of us who have long argued that the legal authority supported Trump,\u201d this week\u2019s Supreme Court order \u201cwas belated but not surprising,\u201d says Jonathan Turley at The Hill. So now there\u2019s a respite until October, when the justices will hear the full case, allowing \u201csome time for self-examination.\u201d Because \u201cthe analysis surrounding the immigration order seemed to drop any pretense of objectivity and took on the character of open Trump-bashing.\u201d Ironically, Trump\u2019s \u201csignature attacks often cause people to fulfill the very stereotypes that he paints, particularly among some reporters and judges.\u201d Indeed, \u201che seems like the itch that reporters and commentators just have to scratch and frankly sometimes it seems like a few are enjoying it too much.\u201d Which means viewers \u201care being given a false notion of the underlying legal issues,\u201d with their \u201csubtle distinctions and balancing tests.\u201d\n\nTerrorism watch: It Will Get Worse Before It Gets Better\n\nJihadist attacks like the ones in London, Ontario and Manchester typify what Bruce Newsome at The Conversation calls \u201cthe newest form of terrorism.\u201d It aims \u201cto kill as many people as possible, as frequently as possible, as horrifically as possible, intimately, suicidally, with the most accessible weapons, in the most accessible public spaces.\u201d And not in long-planned hijackings or bombings, but with \u201cmore frequent active violence, hostage-takings and kidnappings.\u201d No longer do they \u201cjust wait for an infrequent spectacular attack like 9/11.\u201d So while terrorist attacks are becoming less lethal individually, they\u2019re growing more so when added together. Plus: \u201cTerrorist ideologies are becoming more religiously extreme. This is associated with more murderousness, more willingness to die and more intransigence.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Compiled by Eric Fettmann\u200b", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-27", "type": "article"}
