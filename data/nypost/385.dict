Police said they were confident no other suspects were involved in the attack.\n\n\u201cThey consider this a lone-wolf situation,\u201d a source told Reuters. A possible motive for the Sunday night attack was not released.\n\nBissonnette \u2014 who was not previously known to police \u2014 lived with his parents in a single-family home in the Cap-Rouge district, where police conducted a search Monday. His father is listed in the sales deed as an investigator, the Montreal Gazette reported.\n\nAuthorities earlier named two suspects, but one of them \u2014 a Canadian of Moroccan descent \u2014 was later released after it was determined he was only a witness to the bloodbath at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Qu\u00e9bec in Ste-Foy.\n\nBissonnette fled in his Mitsubishi but was caught about 12 miles away near l\u2019\u00eele d\u2019Orleans after he called 911, police Inspector Denis Turcotte said. Two rifles and an AK-47 assault rifle were found in the car.\n\n\u201cHe was armed and spoke to us about his acts,\u201d Turcotte said, the National Post of Canada reported. \u201cHe seemed to want to cooperate\u2026.The suspect said he was waiting for the police to arrive.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said he \u201cfelt bad\u201d and was threatening to kill himself, the French-language newspaper Le Soleil reported.\n\nWitnesses said the gunman shouted \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d \u2013 or \u201cGod is great!\u201d \u2013 during the rampage, Radio-Canada reported.\n\nBoth police and witnesses had initially described two masked men open fire about 7:30 p.m. inside the mosque, where about 50 people were praying. The terrified worshipers fled barefoot in the snow as bullets flew.\n\nThe victims \u2014 all men \u2014 ranged in age from 35 to 60 and were dual nationals, police said. Thirty-nine people were unharmed.\n\nFive people were in critical condition and 14 others suffered minor injuries, according to the Centre Hospitalier Universite Laval, the National Post reported.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a very, very big tragedy for us,\u201d mosque Vice President Mohamed Labidi said. \u201cSecurity at our mosque was our major, major concern, but we were caught off guard.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said Muslim-Canadians are \u201can important part of our national fabric.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence.\u201d\n\nTrump called Trudeau Monday to offer his condolences and to offer assistance, the prime minister\u2019s office said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the attack \u201canother senseless act of violence that cannot be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, when it comes to our nation\u2019s safety and security,\u201d Spicer told reporers.\n\nAli Hamadi said one of his good friends, father-of-three Abdelkrim Hassen, was killed.\n\n\u201cHe was my friend, my colleague. We worked together in the civil service for the Quebec government. Had I not left early I could have among the victims,\u201d Hamadi told the Toronto-based Globe and Mail.\n\n\u201cSuch a tragic event. How can his children ever come to grasp how their father could have been murdered while praying in a mosque?\u201d Hamadi said.\n\nA witness said the attacker walked in and started spraying bullets at \u201ceverything that was moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was someone who mastered weapons because it was calm,\u201d the man, who did not give his name, told the paper. \u201cHe killed and he killed. It was really horrible.\u201d\n\nHe said he lay on his stomach as the man emptied his weapon. Then, he said, the gunman just stopped and left.\n\nMosque President Mohammed Yangui, who was not inside when the shooting erupted, said he got desperate calls from people at evening prayers.\n\n\u201cA mass shooting. In Quebec City. I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told the Globe and Mail. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything to provoke anyone, and we\u2019ve never cultivated hatred for anyone. I\u2019m just beside myself.\u201d\n\nThe mosque has already been the target of hate. In June 2016, a pig\u2019s head was left on the doorstep during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Police Department said it was stepping up patrols at mosques and other houses of worship.\n\n\u201cNYPD is providing additional protection for mosques in the city. All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,\u201d Mayor de Blasio said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOur prayers tonight are with the people of Quebec City as they deal with a terrible attack on a mosque. We must stand together,\u201d Hizzoner said in another tweet.\n\nHours after the shooting, concerned residents gathered at the Centre sportif de Sainte Foy, where Gazi Hamrouni spent six hours looking for a friend of 20 years.\n\n\u201cHe was the first I called when I heard the news,\u201d Hamrouni told The Globe and Mail. \u201cHis phone didn\u2019t pick up, now it\u2019s dead and I\u2019ve been to every hospital in the city, several times.\u201d\n\nWith Post Wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
