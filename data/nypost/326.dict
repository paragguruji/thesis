They said America\u2019s enemies see these \u201crisk takers\u201d as enemies, but that they should be counted as friends.\n\n\u201cFor such individuals, time is not an ally,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThere is no place to which they may return for a normal life even after stability and reconstruction in their devastated lands.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers include conservative members of Congress from Oklahoma, Louisiana and Utah. They said they are motivated after walking \u201camong these valiant and courageous souls who have helped the U.S. armed forces\u201d and concerned for suffering children.\n\nThe letter illustrates lingering frustration on Capitol Hill with Trump\u2019s order, which he issued last week without consulting Republican leaders. The House lawmakers steer clear of picking a fight with the president \u2014 they don\u2019t dispute the \u201cimprovements\u201d to the U.S. immigration system the new policy is aiming to make.\n\nBut they make clear the net has been cast too wide and could have a chilling effect in future conflicts as people may shy away from aiding American troops in combat zones.\n\n\u201cWe must make it clear that Americans can be trusted to stand with those who have stood with us,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nFormer CIA Director David Petraeus, testifying Wednesday before the House Armed Services Committee, said a senior Iraqi general who has led the fight against the Islamic State has been blocked from coming to the U.S. to meet with his American counterparts because of the order.\n\nAmong the lawmakers to sign the letter are Reps. Steve Russell, R-Okla., Seth Moulton, D-Mass., Martha McSally, R-Ariz., Mike Coffman, R-Colo., Chris Stewart, R-Utah, and Ralph Abraham, R-La.\n\nWith Post Wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
