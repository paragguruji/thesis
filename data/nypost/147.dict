That was during the Obama situation. [CIA Director] Mike Pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job,\u201d the president added.\n\nJust last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was careful to say he wouldn\u2019t confirm the documents\u2019 authenticity.\n\n\u201c[F]or obvious reasons it is our policy as a government not to confirm the authenticity of any kind of disclosure or hack. That would be highly inappropriate for us,\u201d Spicer said at a March 8 press briefing at the White House.\n\nSpicer, like his boss, blamed Obama for the leaks.\n\n\u201cBut all of these occurred under the last administration \u2013 that is important. All of these alleged issues,\u201d he said at the same briefing.\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent confirmation that the documents did come from the CIA would mean that in fact the CIA can use everyday electronics \u2013 from smartphones to high-tech TVs \u2013 as eavesdropping devices.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "type": "article"}
