No wall! USA for all!\u201d the crowd chanted as they stood on the stairs and plazas outside Borough Hall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your religion, your color, what country you are from. We are all human,\u201d explained Malek Uhaib, a 26-year-old Yemeni who lives in Jamaica and works at Smash Grill, one of the roughly 1,000 businesses that shut down from noon to 8 p.m. in protest of Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban on non-US citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Yemen.\n\n\u201cEven if I lose money, I will achieve democracy,\u201d said Coney Island resident Nader Muharram, 34, the owner of Metro Finest Deli in downtown Brooklyn.\n\nHe expected to lose at least $2,000, but said it\u2019s something he felt compelled to do.\n\n\u201cWe have to close, otherwise no one is going to listen to us. Unconstitutional orders are being placed on us. We have to go out and let the people know that this is not acceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nAround 5:15 p.m. Thursday, the crowd at Borough Hall gathered to publicly pray.\n\n\u201cWe are all brothers,\u201d Uhaib said as thousands waved American and Yemeni flags. \u201cTogether, we will make America great again.\u201d\n\nSal Altaheri, 57, a retired MTA supervisor from Boerum Hill, noted many of those banned from entering the US had green cards.\n\n\u201cFamilies who are legally permitted to enter this country are being barred,\u201d he fumed. \u201cThey obtained their visas legally, they have all the documentation, background checks. They have been to the consulate. They paid so much money to come here and now they can\u2019t come here.\u201d\n\nMudhash Alnjar, 45, who shut down his Superior Market & Deli in Crown Heights for the day, said: \u201cMr. Trump isn\u2019t allowing my people in my country, and now he wants to kick out ones who are already here. Some of them have green cards . . . It\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "type": "article"}
