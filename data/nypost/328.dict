They said they are motivated after walking \u201camong these valiant and courageous souls who have helped the US armed forces\u201d and are concerned about suffering children.\n\nThe letter illustrates lingering frustration on Capitol Hill over Trump\u2019s order, which he issued last week without consulting Republican leaders. The House lawmakers steer clear of picking a fight with the president \u2014 they don\u2019t dispute the \u201cimprovements\u201d to the US immigration system the new policy is aiming to make.\n\nBut they make clear the net has been cast too wide and could have a chilling effect in future conflicts as people may shy away from aiding American troops in combat zones.\n\n\u201cWe must make it clear that Americans can be trusted to stand with those who have stood with us,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nAmong the lawmakers signing the letter are Reps. Steve Russell (R-Okla.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), Chris Stewart (R-Utah) and Ralph Abraham (R-La.).\n\nWith Post wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
