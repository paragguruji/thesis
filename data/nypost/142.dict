His five-day tour cost $2,200.\n\nOther Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist.\n\nBanfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly travelling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States last month announced a ban on US passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya.\n\nHeidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.\n\n\u201cWe started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there.\n\nNorth Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan.\n\nThe US ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year.\n\nWarmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the US in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma.\n\nWarmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cI was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,\u201d Burkhead said.\n\nThe State Department declared US passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state.\n\nNorth Korean state media has described the ban as a \u201csordid\u201d attempt to limit human exchanges.\n\nNorth Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.\n\nThis month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years.\n\nHundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to US lawmaker Joe Wilson.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "type": "article"}
