In his speech, Trump called for a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for immigration \u2014 saying, \u201cIt will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families.\u201d\n\nsee also In first congressional address, Trump pitches ambitious agenda President Trump called for an overhaul of ObamaCare, $1 trillion...\n\nDuring his sit-down with the media, the president insisted that he would keep some of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, including the nation\u2019s DREAMers \u2014 the title given to undocumented youths brought to the country as children.\n\nThe apparent pivot comes after Trump claimed for months that he would ramp up deportations and build a wall along the US-Mexico border to keep out \u201cbad hombres\u201d who he says have been coming into the country illegally.\n\nSince taking office in January, the president has moved closer and closer to fulfilling those promises.\n\nOne move, made in part with the Department of Homeland Security last Tuesday, was to enforce policies that would subject any illegal immigrants in the country to deportation if they were to ever be charged, convicted or even suspected of a crime.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s about-face also comes at a time when he continues to distance himself from his campaign agenda.\n\nWhile Trump used to be a vocal critic of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders to protect illegal immigrants from deportation, he has refrained from rolling those safeguards back.\n\nAlso, earlier this month, Trump told reporters that he ultimately wanted to deal with the DREAMers with a \u201cgreat heart,\u201d although he did not say how.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "type": "article"}
