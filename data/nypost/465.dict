A hearing on that is scheduled for Oct. 10.\n\n\u200bTrump administration lawyers told \u200bjustices on Monday that changing the way it enforces the policy on refugees would allow \u201cadmission of refugees who have no connection to the United States independent of the refugee-admission process itself.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court decision, which affects about 24,000 refugees, could take effect on Tuesday.\n\nWith Wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-09-11", "type": "article"}
