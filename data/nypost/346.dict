Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!\u201d Trump said in a morning tweet.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest tweet suggests the White House is retreating from its position from the day before.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted to reporters that the executive order is not a \u201cban.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be a ban if you\u2019re letting 1 million people, and if 325,000 people from another [Muslim] country can come in, then that is, by nature, not a ban,\u201d Spicer said Tuesday at the White House.\n\nBut when a reporter notified the press secretary that it was President Trump who labeled it a \u201cban,\u201d Spicer conceded, \u201cI understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is he confused, or you confused?\u201d the reporter asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confused. The words being used to describe it derive from what the media is calling this. [The president] has been clear it is \u2018extreme vetting,\u2019\u201d Spicer said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
