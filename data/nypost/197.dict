Outside Trump Tower, City Hall and Washington Square Park in Manhattan were among the prime hot\u200b\u200bspots.\n\nGet Organized BK!, a Brooklyn-based progressive group formed by Councilman Brad Lander, organized the most protests with 10, including a February \u201cdie-in\u201d where activists lied on sidewalks outside \u200bBrooklyn \u200bBorough Hall and faked their deaths in opposition of Trump\u2019s proposed healthcare plan.\n\n\u201cYou would have to go back to the Vietnam War to see similar protest activity,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, a senior vice president for The Trust for Public Land who previously served 11 years as city parks commissioner under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nT\u200bhe \u200bNew Yorkers for Parks study was apolitical, \u200bbut a \u200b\u200breview of the cited \u200bprotests \u200b\u200bshows nearly all of them were critical of \u200b the president.\n\nsee also 'Show us your f---ing taxes!': Trump protesters flood Midtown Thousands of protesters flooded Midtown Manhattan streets Saturday to pressure...\n\nMany of the protests were held without permits as the NYPD says they\u2019re not required for activity on public streets and sidewalks.\n\nSince January, the Parks Department issued 81 permits to protest groups \u2014 a 21 \u200bpercent spike from the 67 issued over the same time in 2016. These protests involved at least some use of parkland, but some still operated primarily on local streets and sidewalks.\n\nLynn Kelly, New Yorkers for Parks\u2019 executive director, said the city has \u200bso far shown it\u200b \u200bis \u201cwell prepared\u201d to accommodate the surge in protests.\n\nHowever, she expects public spaces to be flooded with even more \u200bdemonstrations during the warmer months \u2013 adding it\u2019s \u201cnot clear\u201d whether enough resources have been allocated through the NYPD, Sanitation Department, Parks Department and other city agencies to deal with such a long-term uptick.\n\n\u201cWe need to start thinking about what are the best sites in each borough to accommodate large crowds,\u201d she said.\n\nNatalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for Mayor de Blasio said the \u200bde Blasio \u200badministration believes it is already well equipped to handle the \u201cTrump Bump\u201d in protests.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is part of what makes New York City the greatest city in the world,\u201d Grybauskas said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entirely comfortable with our ability to keep people safe and our city orderly during this unique period in history.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-04-24", "type": "article"}
