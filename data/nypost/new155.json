Cuomo said.\n\nFatemah Taghizadeh\u2019s parents were hoping to meet with doctors in Oregon on Feb. 5 for the emergency surgery and they traveled to Dubai to get a visa, according to a report by the Oregonian.\n\nTheir embassy appointment was cancelled because of the executive order preventing Iranian nationals, among others, from traveling to the United States, the baby\u2019s uncle, who lives in Portland told news reporters.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed outrage and said the Empire State would be glad to help little Fatemah.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the consequence of this un-American policy,\u201d Cuomo tweeted Thursdsay night. \u201cAn exception should be made. If OR has issue, NY will provide care.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and immigration lawyers are trying to help the baby\u2019s uncle and grandfather obtain an exception to the travel ban so the family can be united and the tiny girl can get the surgery she needs for a grave condition.\n\nThough New York State has no shortage of respected heart surgeons, it was not immediately clear where Cuomo would refer the pediatric patient but his spokesman said the governor would personally step in to assist.\n\n\u201cThe pain and damage of this flawed federal policy is especially repulsive in this case preventing a child from getting life saving treatment,\u201d said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi.\u201dIf the plane lands in New York the Governor will personally make sure the child gets the health care she needs. New York and America does not let children die because we deprived them of healthcare.\u200e\u201d", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["infant", "spokesman", "transplant", "state", "preventing", "iranian", "cant", "united", "states", "cuomo", "surgery", "uncle", "york", "help", "policy", "offers"], "summary": "ALBANY \u2013 An adorable Iranian infant, whose family says she can\u2019t get into the United States for a heart transplant, can receive care in New York if the Trump administration will allow the 4-month\u2013old into the country, Gov.\nCuomo said.\nTheir embassy appointment was cancelled because of the executive order preventing Iranian nationals, among others, from traveling to the United States, the baby\u2019s uncle, who lives in Portland told news reporters.\nAndrew Cuomo expressed outrage and said the Empire State would be glad to help little Fatemah.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the consequence of this un-American policy,\u201d Cuomo tweeted Thursdsay night."}
