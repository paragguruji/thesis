Jeff Sessions in what now appears to be a remarkable moment during her 2015 confirmation hearing.\n\nSessions, Trump\u2019s current nominee for attorney general, had warned Yates during his grilling that she might face a crucial decision when confronting the president.\n\n\u201cDo you think the attorney general has the responsibility to say \u2018no\u2019 to the president if he asks for something that\u2019s improper?\u201d Sessions asked Yates in the hearing.\n\n\u201cIf the views that the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or deputy attorney general say \u2018no\u2019?\u201d\n\nsee also Trump fires acting AG for defying immigration ban WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday fired Sally Yates,...\n\nYates replied that she was bound by the Constitution to do what is best for the country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d Yates replied.\n\nYates was faced with that very decision on Monday.\n\nShe was tasked to mount a legal defense for Trump\u2019s executive order which bars immigrants from seven Muslim-dominated countries. She refused.\n\nIn a statement, Yates said she did not believe the order was lawful, setting off a firestorm of accusations of political bias.\n\nTrump quickly fired Yates and installed Dana Boente, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to run the Justice Department. Boente quickly said he would uphold Trump\u2019s travel ban in court.\n\nSessions\u2019 confirmation is set for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday before it moves to a floor vote. In the meantime, Boente will continue in the acting AG role.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
