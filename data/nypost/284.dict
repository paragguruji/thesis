Ask a grownup to show you what \u2018EASY D\u2019 means at the urban dictionary websites. #ClownPresident,\u201d wrote liberal motormouth Keith Olberman. \u201cJust think: somewhere right now, two White House staffers are discussing how to tell the President of the United States what \u2018Easy D\u2019 means,\u201d tweeted David Mack.\n\nOthers guessed differently.\n\n\u201c\u2019EASY D\u2019 was Trump\u2019s selection criterion for the classes he took at Wharton,\u201d wrote a poster called Resist Facism.\n\n\u201cThe shift in baseball creates too much EASY D! We must abolish it! If the sad Cardinals do it, it deserves to be GONE!\u201d wrote PirateTrump.\n\n\u201cDear press: Please ask Sean Spicer what Trump was referring to when he said \u2018Easy D\u2019. Because I would love to watch him explain,\u201d added Amy.\n\n\u201cEasy D is Frederick Douglass\u2019 nickname for Donald Trump. They are very good friends,\u201d tweeted Martha O\u2019Hara.\n\nBut some supporters thought Trump should embrace EASY D as a new moniker.\n\n\u201dTrump just trolled the trolls by using phrase \u2018Easy D.\u2019 They dont even realize they got played & gave him badass nickname #EasyD,\u201d wrote Trump the Hill, described as \u201cHispanic Team of America First Nationalists.\u201d\n\nThe post included a doctored photo of Trump in shades, wearing a gold crown and smoking a blunt with the logo \u201cThug Life.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier had slammed the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cso political.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of police chiefs and sheriffs, the president praised his executive order enacting a ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\u201cIt was written beautifully,\u201d Trump said, asserting that even \u201ca bad high school student would understand this.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
