Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said: \u201cThis vetting proposal itself needed more vetting\u2026.And while not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one which is inconsistent with our American character.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Democrats would introduce legislation to overturn Trump\u2019s order, which he said revealed \u201cthe incompetence of this administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hand doesn\u2019t know what the other is doing. Most of the departments in charge of enforcing it didn\u2019t even know about it,\u201d Schumer told a news conference at his Midtown Manhattan office.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel \u201cregrets\u201d Trumps\u2019s action, said a spokesman who noted that Merkel reminded Trump during a phone call Saturday about the Geneva Conventions requirement to re-settle war refugees.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, who on Friday met with Trump at the White House, does \u201cnot agree\u201d with the order he signed afterward, a spokesman said, and Foreign Minister Boris Johnson won an exemption for dual-citizenship Brits who travel to America from anywhere other than the covered countries.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus did little to calm the waters, telling NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump\u2019s order \u201cdoesn\u2019t include green-card holders going forward,\u201d before adding: \u201cIf you\u2019re traveling back and forth, you\u2019re going to be subjected to further screening.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement saying he had deemed \u201cthe entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Sunday, lawyers who won a temporary stay of any deportations under Trump\u2019s order filed an emergency motion asking Brooklyn federal Judge Ann Donnelly to enforce her Saturday night ruling.\n\nIn court papers, the lawyers said they repeatedly heard about people \u201cwho have been placed on planes, possibly deported and subject to intimidation to sign removal orders after the issuance of the court order.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment, but the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that all individuals affected by the executive orders, including those affected by the court orders, are being provided all rights afforded under the law.\u201d\n\nDHS also said it was \u201cworking closely\u201d with airlines to keep anyone subject to Trump\u2019s order from boarding planes bound for America.\n\nThe biggest winner of the weekend appeared to be the American Civil Liberties Union, which was flooded with more than $10 million in donations and gained more than 150,000 new members, Yahoo! News reported.\n\n\u201cI hope Trump enjoys losing,\u201d ACLU National Director Faiz Shakir said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to lose so much we\u2019re going to get sick and tired of his losing.\u201d\n\nWith Post Wire Services", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
