Bush appointee, nixed Trump\u2019s order and ruled that travel restrictions across the country should be lifted immediately.\n\n\u201cThe state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,\u201d Robart said.\n\nThe judge said Trump\u2019s ban was lifted \u201con a nationwide basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution prevailed today,\u201d said Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who represented the state in a lawsuit against the order. \u201cNo one is above the law \u2014 not even the president.\u201d\n\nThe US Customs and Border Protection swiftly moved to honor all visas invalidated by the ban, opening the doors to travelers around the world on Friday.\n\nThe White House quickly struck back, issuing a statement that said the Justice Department would file an emergency stay of this \u201coutrageous\u201d order.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMinutes later, the White House issued a second statement that excluded the word \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nTrump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida at the time the order came down. He was expected to stay there for the weekend and host a Super Bowl party.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) quickly pounced on Trump, hailing the decision after the court ruling was issued.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is a victory for the Constitution and for all of us who believe this un-American executive order will not make us safer,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should heed this ruling and he ought to back off and repeal the executive order once and for all.\u201d\n\nThe decision by Robart set up a legal battle over executive power that could ultimately be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump\u2019s order, signed last Friday, sparked protests nationwide and confusion at airports as some travelers were detained or sent back to their points of origin. The White House has argued the order \u2014 which barred all refugees for 120 days and non-US citizens traveling from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen for 90 days \u2014 will make the country safer.\n\nWashington state became the first state to sue over the order. Ferguson, the state attorney general, said the travel ban significantly harms residents and effectively mandates discrimination.\n\nAfter the ruling, Ferguson said people from the affected countries can now apply for entry to the United States.\n\nThe challenge in the Seattle court was brought by the state of Washington and later joined by the state of Minnesota. The judge ruled that the states have legal standing to sue, which could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration.\n\nWashington\u2019s case was based on claims that the state had suffered harm from the ban, citing students and faculty at state-funded universities who were stranded overseas.\n\nWith Post Wire Services", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["ruling", "epic", "travel", "executive", "judges", "battle", "trump", "ban", "state", "sets", "blocking", "court", "statement", "judge", "travelers", "order", "white", "stage"], "summary": "The ruling by Judge James Robart, a George W.
