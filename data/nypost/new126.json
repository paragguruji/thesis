The mother-in-law of Imam Ismail Elshikh is a Syrian national living in Syria, according to the lawsuit that details the effect the ban would have had on Elshikh\u2019s family and others in Hawaii.\n\nAccording to the motion, attorneys for the government had no position on the request to file another amended lawsuit.\n\nHawaii plans to file its amended lawsuit and a motion for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.\n\nTuesday\u2019s motion proposes a hearing on March 15, a day before the revised ban goes into effect.\n\nHawaii has hired a Washington, D.C., law firm to help. Josh Wisch, a spokesman for the attorney general\u2019s office, said last month the firm is giving the state a 50 percent discount.\n\n\u201cThis new executive order is nothing more than Muslim Ban 2.0,\u201d Chin said in a statement Monday. \u201cUnder the pretense of national security, it still targets immigrants and refugees. It leaves the door open for even further restrictions.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press", "March"], "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "file", "hawaii", "revised", "amended", "ban", "challenge", "state", "court", "trumps", "syria", "lawsuit", "order", "motion"], "summary": "HONOLULU \u2014 Hawaii plans to challenge President Donald Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, Attorney General Doug Chin said Tuesday.\nThis is the second time Hawaii has asked a judge to lift the stay in order to file an amended lawsuit.\nAccording to the motion, attorneys for the government had no position on the request to file another amended lawsuit.\nHawaii plans to file its amended lawsuit and a motion for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.\nTuesday\u2019s motion proposes a hearing on March 15, a day before the revised ban goes into effect."}
