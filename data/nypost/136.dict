Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University, told The Post.\n\n\u201cThe jury is still out if this is the case with support for Trump, but it is possible,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, the Internet-based Rasmussen poll released Thursday found Trump with a 54 percent approval rating and 46 percent disapproval \u2014 almost the mirror image of the live-phone CNN poll released the same day, in which only 44 percent of those polled approved of his job while 53 percent disapproved.\n\nThe disparate Trump approval ratings have become a point of contention in press briefings. Polls of Trump\u2019s immigration policy are similarly skewed.\n\nOnline surveys like the one conducted by Reuters found that 48 percent of Americans supported the president\u2019s entry restrictions, but when Americans in a Gallup poll were called by pollsters, only 42 percent favored the measures.\n\nThe findings reinforce the notion that \u201cshy Trump supporters\u201d are being significantly underestimated by pollsters trying to measure Trump\u2019s popularity \u2014 as they may have been in polls taken before November\u2019s election.\n\nThey also harken back to the \u201cSilent Majority\u201d that gave Richard M. Nixon the presidency in 1968, when anti-establishment protesters won the headlines but not the White House.\n\nTrump is paying attention to the polls no matter what they project.\n\n\u201cI had given him the whole [polling data] the other day on the ban, or whatever it was,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Real Clear Politics. \u201cHe gets it.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
