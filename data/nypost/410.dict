And you see gang violence that you\u2019ve read about like never before, all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally. And they\u2019re rough and they\u2019re tough but they\u2019re not tough like our people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe comments came as the United States\u2019 top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly were in Mexico meeting with their counterparts.\n\nKelly immediately set about to reassure Mexico that there would be \u201cno mass deportations\u201d and \u201cno use of military forces.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer later tried to walk back Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe president was using that as an adjective. It is happening with precision,\u201d Spicer said of Trump\u2019s military-operation comment.\n\nBut the spokesman insisted that immigration enforcement would be carried out.\n\n\u201cWe have untied the hands of ICE and border agents,\u201d Spicer told reporters.\n\nTrump had the business leaders introduce themselves, and when it was the turn of GE\u2019s Jeff Immelt, the president asked the CEO to tell the assemblage of the commander in chief\u2019s golf prowess.\n\n\u201cJeff actually watched me make a hole in one. Should you tell that story?\u201d Trump said.\n\nImmelt said the two had golfed during negotiations for the NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d with Trump boasting he was the best \u201crichest\u201d golfer in the world.\n\n\u201cI actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people,\u201d Trump said, correcting the CEO.\n\nOther biz titans at Thursday\u2019s meeting included Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, Inge Thulin of 3M, Mark Fields of Ford and Mario Longhi of US Steel.\n\nTrump is expected to clarify his immigration plans in a speech next week to a joint session of Congress.\n\nAlso next week, the president is expected to sign an executive order implementing a new travel ban blocking US entry from seven Muslim-majority countries after his earlier order was blocked by the courts.\n\nSpicer said the delay with the new order was because of due diligence in making sure the effort would be carried out \u201cin a flawless manner.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-23", "type": "article"}
