Ali Jr. showed them his passport and driver\u2019s license, said attorney Chris Mancini, a family friend.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was religiously profiled,\u201d Ali Jr. said. \u201cI felt violated.\u201d\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection spokesman Daniel Hetlage confirmed that Ali Jr. was held for questioning by customs officers, but said \u201cit wasn\u2019t because he\u2019s a Muslim and it wasn\u2019t because of his Arabic-sounding name.\u201d\n\nThe agency said in a statement that its officers process more than 1.2 million international travelers daily with \u201cvigilance and in accordance with the law.\u201d It said it does not discriminate based on religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cWe treat all travelers with respect and sensitivity,\u201d it said.\n\nAli Jr. and his mother said it was the first time they had been asked if they\u2019re Muslims when re-entering the United States.\n\nHis father, a three-time heavyweight boxing champion, became famous outside the ring as a civil rights champion. After his conversion to Islam, Ali refused to enter the military during the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector. His decision resulted in a draft-evasion conviction, and he was stripped of his heavyweight crown.\n\nAli\u2019s legal fight ended when the US Supreme Court ruled in his favor.\n\nAli died last June at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nHis son said Monday his treatment by the customs officials is the kind of wrong his father fought against.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like history is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having to fight for our humanity all over again. And now they\u2019re sticking the religion on it.\u201d\n\nCamacho Ali said she was detained about a half-hour and questioned about her religion and background.\n\n\u201cI was in a state of shock,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cThey started asking me about where did you get your name and where were you born and what religion are you?\u201d\n\nWhile detained, she said, she pulled out a half-century-old photo of her and Ali on their first date.\n\nThe customs officials gave no reason for their detention and no apology when they were released, Ali Jr. and his mother said.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re free to go,'\u201d Ali Jr. said. \u201cI was free to go as soon as I got here.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press", "February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["jr", "detention", "airport", "mother", "customs", "theyre", "violated", "ali", "officials", "religion", "muhammad", "felt", "feel", "son", "detained"], "summary": "Muhammad Ali\u2019s son said Monday he felt \u201cviolated\u201d when immigration officials questioned him about his religion at a Florida airport.\n\u201cI was just appalled,\u201d Muhammad Ali Jr. told the Associated Press in a phone interview.\nAli Jr. showed them his passport and driver\u2019s license, said attorney Chris Mancini, a family friend.\nThe customs officials gave no reason for their detention and no apology when they were released, Ali Jr. and his mother said.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re free to go,'\u201d Ali Jr. said."}
