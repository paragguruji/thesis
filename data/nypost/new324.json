Please don\u2019t make up attacks,\u201d the daughter of Hillary Clinton tweeted Friday, jabbing at Conway\u2019s fictional slaughter while referring to the very real attack earlier that day by a knife-wielding man at the Paris museum.\n\nThe Trump confidante shot back with a low blow, calling Clinton\u2019s mom a loser and citing the then-candidate\u2019s false 2008 claim to have landed \u201cunder sniper fire\u201d during a visit to war-torn Bosnia.\n\n\u201cBosnia lie a Great reminder. And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can\u2019t \u2018invent\u2019 quality candidates either,\u201d Conway tweeted. \u201cI misspoke; you lost the election.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton spun the harrowing gunfire tale in a speech during her 2008 presidential run, but reporters unearthed video of her landing peacefully and greeting children on the tarmac for the 1996 visit.\n\nBy Friday morning, Conway had already caught plenty of heat for her on-air invention of the imaginary massacre.\n\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn\u2019t get covered,\u201d she said on \u201cHardball.\u201d\n\nConway had cited the \u201cmassacre\u201d to justify Trump\u2019s travel ban. But she apologized Friday morning, saying she misspoke and meant to use the word \u201cterrorists\u201d instead of \u201cmassacre.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say \u2018Bowling Green terrorists\u2019 as reported here,\u201d Conway tweeted, with a link to an ABC News report that said two al Qaeda terrorists were found in 2009 living as refugees in Bowling Green, Ky.\n\nThe 2013 report says the two Iraqi citizens, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were indicted as part of an undercover operation for trying to send weapons back to their Iraqi homeland \u201cfor the purpose of killing US soldiers.\u201d\n\nBoth men were later convicted on terrorism charges.\n\nBut Conway became the target of online criticism \u2014 and some clever spoofs \u2014 all day Friday.\n\nThey included a satirical Web page for a \u201cBowling Green Massacre Victims Fund.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we join together with our thoughts and prayers, we will always remember how our fortitude and compassion unite us all through these difficult times,\u201d the site reads.\n\n\u201cWe all still carry the vivid memories of what horrors occurred at Bowling Green, but some still relive those moments everyday as they work to rebuild a community torn apart.\u201d\n\nBut when users click the \u201cdonate now\u201d button on the site, they are directed the donation page for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nSome Democrats said the Twitter squabble between Clinton and Conway was evidence that the former first daughter is laying the groundwork to eventually run for political office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual for Chelsea to be so overtly political,\u201d one party insider told The Post.\n\nNew York state Democratic Party Executive Director Basil Smikle said: \u201cChelsea would get a lot of support if she decides to run. I\u2019m sure she would be a great candidate and a strong leader like her parents have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had great tutors. If Chelsea has half the commitment to public service that her parents have, she\u2019d be an outstanding candidate and a good representative for the state.\u201d", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["clintons", "sparks", "clinton", "iraqi", "bowling", "dig", "kellyanne", "conway", "twitter", "tweeted", "chelsea", "green", "terrorists", "run", "feud", "massacre", "great"], "summary": "or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre.\nPlease don\u2019t make up attacks,\u201d the daughter of Hillary Clinton tweeted Friday, jabbing at Conway\u2019s fictional slaughter while referring to the very real attack earlier that day by a knife-wielding man at the Paris museum.\nAnd 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can\u2019t \u2018invent\u2019 quality candidates either,\u201d Conway tweeted.\nSome Democrats said the Twitter squabble between Clinton and Conway was evidence that the former first daughter is laying the groundwork to eventually run for political office.\nNew York state Democratic Party Executive Director Basil Smikle said: \u201cChelsea would get a lot of support if she decides to run."}
