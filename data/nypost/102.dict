Google declined to comment further.\n\nSergey Brin, Google co-founder and president of Alphabet, attended a protest of Trump\u2019s ban at the San Francisco airport Saturday. His family emigrated to the US from the Soviet Union when he was a child.\n\nEven some executives who hold European or Canadian citizenship are altering travel plans because they\u2019re worried about being stopped at the US border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling all of my clients not to leave the US,\u201d said Farah Al-khersan, an immigration attorney who works in Warren, Michigan, outside Detroit.\n\nAl-khersan, an Iraqi-born American citizen, was held up for hours at the Port Huron bridge on the border between Canada and the US over the weekend following a day trip to visit her husband\u2019s parents in Sarnia.\n\nDuring the stop at the frontier Friday night, Al-khersan said, she was told that she could re-enter the country but not her husband, an Iraqi-born Canadian citizen who\u2019s a permanent U.S. resident and works as a pharmacist. He was eventually allowed in.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
