All refugees are barred for 120 days.\n\nThere are exemptions for visitors with a \u201ccredible claim of bona fide relationship\u201d with an American employer, school or \u201cclose family\u201d member.\n\nThe government\u2019s definition of \u201cclose family\u201d excludes grandparents and grandchildren, aunts and uncles and other \u201cextended\u201d family members.\n\n\u201cWe based that on the definition of family in the Immigration and Nationality Act,\u201d a 1965 law that ironically was intended to ease admission to the US, a senior administration official said.\n\nFiances and fiancees initially were included among those excluded, but the State Department reversed that decision late Thursday, an official told Reuters.\n\nImmigration advocates slammed the decision to ban certain family members, saying it \u201cdefies common sense\u201d and calling on the government to \u201cvet visa applicants on a case-by-case basis for terrorism concerns.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly accused unnamed members of Congress of trying to intimidate him into easing enforcement of immigration rules.\n\n\u201cI am offended when members of this institution put pressure and often threaten me and my officers to ignore the laws they make,\u201d he said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "type": "article"}
