Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), could be confirmed by the Senate as early as Tuesday.\n\n\u201c[A]s long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,\u201d Yates wrote.\n\nYates was appointed by President Obama to be a United States Attorney in 2010, according to a bio on the Justice Department\u2019s website.\n\nShe agreed to stay on until Sessions takes over.\n\nObama nominated her to be Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s deputy on Jan. 8, 2015.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
