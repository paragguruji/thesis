A Muslim.\u201d\n\nAli, the boxer\u2019s only biological son, was first stopped at customs at Fort Lauderdale Airport on Feb. 7, ironically while returning from a civil rights forum on Capitol Hill.\n\nHe was detained a second time \u2014 for two hours \u2014 on March 10, he said.\n\nHis lawyer, Chris Mancini, told The Mail that he believes officials were trying to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d about making the first detention public.\n\nAli\u2019s class action suit will be filed with his mother, Khalila Ali; he plans to include as plaintiffs more than 1,300 Muslims who also claim the travel rules are discriminatory and abusive, the lawyer said.\n\nAli\u2019s father, who died June 3, famously conscientiously objected to the Vietnam war on religious grounds, getting convicted for draft evasion and giving up both his freedom and his championship title.\n\n\u201cMy father would do the same thing I did,\u201d Ali told Dailymail.com.\n\n\u201cThey still don\u2019t respect people of color,\u201d he complained. \u201cWe are a race of human beings and if I have to fight for eternity then so be it. I will not sleep until our people are respected as an equal opportunity, equal rights for all people that are Americans.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-04-28", "type": "article"}
