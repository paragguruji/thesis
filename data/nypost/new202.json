The Marriott properties most affected by the order are the swanky St. Regis and the Ritz-Carlton, where suites start at $800-plus a night, according to industry sources.\n\nTravelers from the affected regions account for less than 1 percent of Marriott\u2019s bookings, Kim said. But they are among the biggest spenders, say industry experts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shockingly significant number,\u201d said David Chase, managing director of Omni Berkshire Place. Chase was previously the GM of the Lotte New York Palace, which is among the handful of Big Apple hotels that host these big spenders.\n\n\u201cIn a banner year, business from these guests at The Palace contribute up to 10 percent of annual room revenues \u2014 or about $12 million,\u201d according to Chase. \u201cThey travel in groups of 20 to 80 and they will take entire floors at the hotel for months at a time.\u201d\n\nThe Palace, along with other Big Apple luxury hotels that host these affluent visitors \u2014 including the Mandarin Oriental, the Four Seasons and the Peninsula New York \u2014 declined to comment.\n\n\u201cMany families in the Middle East recruit personnel from [those banned] countries and these are the royal households that might refuse to travel to the US. They are accustomed to the services of their trusted staff,\u201d said Cynthia Chung, who runs Private Luxury Attach\u00e9, a New York City company that makes travel arrangements for the super-wealthy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the hotels that are losing business.\n\nChung has arranged for these delegations to rent out entire department stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York, for private shopping excursions.\n\nHotels where these tourists stay often bend over backward to make them happy \u2014 altering floor plans, turning suites into prayer rooms or dining and storage facilities and upgrading their TVs to include hundreds of streamed Arabic channels, Chung said.\n\nA couple of years ago, The Palace hosted a prince who required 180 hotel rooms in the city over a three-month period, according to Chase.\n\nThe prince stayed in an $11,000-a-night suite, forking over $1.2 million to the Palace.\n\nFor entertainment, \u201che literally bought out a movie theater or Dave & Buster\u2019s every night at midnight even if he didn\u2019t use those venues,\u201d Chase said.", "authors": ["April"], "publish_date": "2017-04-12", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "marriott", "industry", "sorenson", "hitting", "ban", "palace", "hardest", "hotels", "trumps", "chase", "luxury", "york", "hotel"], "summary": "Travel to the US from the Middle East and North Africa has fallen 20 percent since President Trump signed his travel ban, a hotel chief executive said this week.\nArne Sorenson, CEO of Marriott International, speaking at a company meeting in Dubai, said the ban on travel from six predominately Muslim countries has been hurting his business.\nThe ban is \u201cnot good, period,\u201d said Sorenson, speaking aloud what most hoteliers have been thinking in private.\nSorenson\u2019s disclosures appear to be the first time a hotel CEO has quantified the impact of the travel ban on the hotel industry, say experts.\nChase was previously the GM of the Lotte New York Palace, which is among the handful of Big Apple hotels that host these big spenders."}
