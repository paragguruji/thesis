Very happy, just like any other mom,\u201d her mother, Farimah Kashkooli, told reporters just moments after the young girl arrived.\n\n\u201cIt went pretty smoothly,\u201d she said. \u201c[Alma] is sleepy right now. She is tired. As soon as possible we are going to go through surgery.\u201d\n\nKashkooli, 33, appeared happy and emotional as she hugged and kissed her daughter in front of her classmates upon her arrival.\n\n\u201cThis time she is on F-2 visa dependent on a student visa,\u201d Kashkooli said.\n\nAlma suffers from what is known as a congenital disorder of glycosylation or CDG, which impairs the cells\u2019 ability to communicate with each other. As a result, she can barely walk or talk and is prone to seizures. Her mother said that she was likely to go blind if barred from entering the US for her treatment.\n\nThe child had been scheduled to leave Tehran last week, and had already obtained a US visa \u2014 but was delayed when her father was unable to do so. Kashkooli, who was already in the US, was planning on making the 20-hour trip herself, until Friday\u2019s ruling by a Seattle judge lifting Trump\u2019s travel restrictions.\n\nHer daughter is one of countless people from the seven countries whose medical care in the US has been jeopardized by the travel ban, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty uncomfortable,\u201d Kashkooli said of not knowing whether Alma would come back to the US, like she has been doing since 2007.\n\n\u201cI was suffering.\u201d\n\nKashkooli \u2014 a Fordham LLM studenth who has a student visa and is on a partial scholarship \u2014 was joined by scores of classmates Monday night who wanted to show their support for her and others like Alma.\n\n\u201cShe is my good friend. I learned about her troubles from an email the school sent out today,\u201d Zhengyi Wang, 26, told The Post.\n\n\u201cI think we could help,\u201d she said. \u201cI skipped the class tonight to come tonight. It\u2019s the right thing to do. That poor little girl needs medical service. There is no reason to ban her.\u201d\n\nA family friend named Jane, who was traveling with Alma on the Turkish Airways flight, said they came into the country without incident.\n\n\u201cThey let us right through,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was very good. She listened to some music and then she slept. It went very well with her. Her name translates to apple and I told her mother, \u2018I\u2019m going to bring little apple to the big apple.\u2019 It was pretty exhausting, but we did it.\u201d", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["girl", "alma", "travel", "airport", "mother", "right", "little", "told", "visa", "dozens", "iranian", "welcome", "kashkooli", "students", "daughter", "law", "jfk", "pretty"], "summary": "Dozens of Fordham law school students gathered at JFK Airport on Monday night to welcome the 11-year-old daughter of an Iranian classmate who was almost barred from coming into the US as a result of President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\nMore than 50 people hunkered down at Terminal 1 \u2014 holding signs, flowers and gifts \u2014 as little Alma Kashkooli came through customs \u201csmoothly\u201d at around 6:23 p.m.\u201cI can\u2019t describe.\nVery happy, just like any other mom,\u201d her mother, Farimah Kashkooli, told reporters just moments after the young girl arrived.\n\u201cThis time she is on F-2 visa dependent on a student visa,\u201d Kashkooli said.\n\u201cIt was pretty uncomfortable,\u201d Kashkooli said of not knowing whether Alma would come back to the US, like she has been doing since 2007."}
