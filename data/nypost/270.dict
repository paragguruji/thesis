Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) made this point forcefully on Jan. 30, when he told MSNBC that Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cultimately is going to get Americans killed.\u201d\n\nThe argument goes like this: Jihadists believe there is a Manichaean struggle between Islam and the West. An alleged \u201cMuslim ban\u201d plays directly into this worldview, telling Muslims they aren\u2019t safe in the un-Islamic world. No wonder they are calling the executive order a \u201cblessed ban\u201d on Islamic State Web forums.\n\nThis is a familiar line to anyone who has followed the national-security debate since 9/11. Democrats in particular have argued that the Iraq War, the Guantanamo Bay prison and anti-Muslim Web videos help to radicalize otherwise peaceful Muslims to murder us at random. Hence Trump\u2019s travel ban is now a \u201crecruitment tool.\u201d\n\nIf only jihadi recruitment were so easily disrupted. Sadly, it\u2019s much more complicated.\n\nTo start, the process by which an individual gets sucked into the death cults of al Qaeda or the Islamic State cannot be reduced to a single cause. The Program on Extremism at George Washington University last year released an invaluable report that studied motivations of Americans who had declared allegiance to the Islamic State. It found they ranged from sympathy for the plight of Syrians suffering under their dictator\u2019s war to a sense of religious obligation to join a new utopian Islamic caliphate.\n\nAnother problem with this argument is that it fails to account for the significant rise in radical Islamic terror under President Barack Obama.\n\nHe went out of his way to counter the jihadist worldview. He began his presidency by delivering a speech to the Islamic world from Cairo, in which he stressed his own administration\u2019s respect for Islam. He promised, and ultimately failed to, close Guantanamo; he withdrew US troops from Iraq in 2011, and he scrubbed terms like \u201cradical Islam\u201d and \u201cwar on terror\u201d from the government\u2019s lexicon.\n\nAnd yet despite his efforts, the FBI arrested more Americans for joining Islamic terrorist groups during his presidency than during that of George W. Bush. And while Obama decimated al Qaeda\u2019s central leadership following the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda\u2019s franchises in Yemen, Somalia and Libya grew stronger.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State broke away from al Qaeda during Obama\u2019s presidency and managed to gain territory in Syria and Iraq. Only now has the military campaign to liberate Mosul shown some success.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Obama also did many things jihadists didn\u2019t like during his presidency. For example, he used drone strikes against more of them than his predecessor did.\n\nThe Islamic State didn\u2019t like the Iran nuclear deal, either. After all, Shiites like the Iran regime are seen as apostates, and in the battle for Syria, the Iranians are on the side of the oppressors.\n\nThis gets to the most important point. The fanatics who seek to re-create an eighth-century caliphate have an endless supply of grievances about our open society. If we succumb to the fallacy that we can counter their propaganda by not doing things they could exploit for propaganda purposes, we are giving them too much power.\n\nA far better argument against Trump\u2019s executive order is that it undermines our own recruitment efforts to counter the jihadists. At first, the travel ban applied to translators who helped the US military in Iraq, not to mention leading advocates for the Islamic State\u2019s victims like the Yazidi-Iraqi legislator Vian Dakhil.\n\nFortunately, the Trump administration has reversed these elements of the travel ban in the last week. But the perception that America would close its doors to the people who helped us makes it harder to recruit allies against the Islamic State.\n\nCritics of Trump\u2019s travel ban are not inclined to make that argument. After all, Democrats were silent when Obama abandoned the Iraqi sheiks who helped to temporarily drive al Qaeda out of al-Anbar province between 2007 and 2009. At the time, they were too busy insisting the Iraq War helped create more terrorists.\n\n\u00a9 2017, Bloomberg View", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "type": "article"}
