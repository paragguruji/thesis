Sad\u200b.,\u201d George Conway wrote, referring to the Office of the Solicitor General, which would argue the White House position if the case came before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president on Monday also re-emphasized that his executive order was in fact a travel ban.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nBut George Conway\u2019s criticism of Trump remarks clashed with comments his wife made earlier Monday morning during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that the media are obsessed over the president\u2019s Tweetstorms, arguing the president shouldn\u2019t be judged on what he says in 140 characters or less.\n\n\u201cThis obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little what he does as president,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, who once claimed White House spokesman Sean Spicer was providing \u201calternative facts\u201d when he disputed crowd size numbers at Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThen a couple of hours after George Conway\u2019s tweets circulated and were reported in a number of media outlets, he apparently felt compelled to return to the messaging site clarify his comments.\n\n\u201c1) Just to be clear, and in response to inquiries, I still VERY, VERY STRONGLY support POTUS, his Admin, policies, the executive order,\u201d he wrote. \u201c2) and of course, my wonderful wife. Which is why I said what I said this morning. Every sensible lawyer in WHCO and every political appointee at DOJ wd agree with me (as some have already told me).\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe pt cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters\u2026seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS \u2013 and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it,\u201d Conway wrote.\n\nAt a White House briefing Monday afternoon, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump\u2019s habit of tweeting his thoughts, saying it allows him to speak directly to the people without the \u201cfilter of media bias.\u201d\n\n\u200bThe president, since the London terror attacks that killed seven people Saturday night, has turned to Twitter to make his case for his executive order that would ban travel from six major Muslim countries.\n\nThe original order from January and a revised version have been caught up in the courts.\n\nOne of the reasons the court held up the order was because Trump regularly called for a ban on Muslims during the campaign, which would be a violation of First Amendment protections against religious discrimination.\n\n\u200b\u200bHe also encouraged his legal aides \u200bto seek an \u201cexpedited hearing\u201d by the Supreme Court on the ban from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen because of the horrific attacks in London.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "type": "article"}
