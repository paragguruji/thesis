Saad, 35, an associate professor at the Lebanon campus, missed his Monday presentation at the Engineering Mechanics Institute Conference in San Diego because Department of Homeland Security officials turned him away at Los Angeles International Airport without explanation, he told The Post.\n\nWhen he landed Friday, Saad said he was detained and interrogated for four hours. His phone was confiscated and his laptop was seized and he had to divulge passwords for his devices. He was photographed and fingerprinted.\n\nSaad said his visa was revoked and he was put on the next plane back toward Beirut without an opportunity to contact a lawyer or his worried wife.\n\n\u201cI belong to the American University of Beirut \u2014 the leading academic institution in Lebanon and the Middle East, chartered in New York and considered an American territory in Lebanon,\u201d Saad told The Post. \u201cI felt so small, so unappreciated and consider being treated in demeaning and humiliating ways.\u201d\n\nAlthough courts have blocked President Trump\u2019s travel ban, his administration is pushing ahead with enhanced screening measures. State Department consular officers have stepped up questioning of visa applicants and are vetting social media activity. Homeland Security officials have increasingly used their removal and detention authority, employed more aggressive screenings at airports and have stepped up searches of travelers\u2019 laptops and smartphones, according to immigration experts.\n\nSaad earned his master\u2019s degree from Johns Hopkins University and his doctorate from the University of Southern California. Saad said he is Christian, has family in America and no criminal record.\n\nHe\u2019s traveled to the US about 15 times without incident and had no trouble attending similar engineering conferences in 2015 and 2016, Saad said.\n\nJonathan Meyer, former deputy general counsel at Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, said the agency does not necessarily tell travelers why they are denied entry, and in some cases they can\u2019t. But, given his frequent visits to the US in the past, Saad\u2019s new travel troubles seem a bit \u201codd.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what information [the Customs agency] is relying on, but this case is compelling in that there does not seem to be an issue here,\u201d said Meyer, a partner at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLC.\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s tough demands for extreme vetting could be the reason for Saad\u2019s denial, Meyer said there\u2019s no way to know definitively.\n\n\u201cHis rejection after years of admission may provide some evidence,\u201d Meyer said. \u201c[Saad] has to be asking himself would this be happening if his last name weren\u2019t Saad or if he weren\u2019t from Lebanon?\u201d\n\nSaad already filed a formal complaint with Homeland Security\u2019s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program so he can come to the conferences in the future, but he\u2019s out the $2,500 cost of the trip.\n\nComplaints over gaining entry into the US have increased 10.5 percent from this point last year: 6,078 from January to May 2017, compared to 5,500 during the same time in 2016. There were 5,985 in the comparable period in 2015.\n\nNeither Homeland Security nor US Customs and Border Protection offered information on why Saad was denied entry to the US.\n\nThe American University of Beirut, which has its US corporate office in the New York, stands by its professor.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand and respect security measures, we are surprised and concerned at the treatment our faculty member received, including his long interrogation followed by denial of his entry into the US,\u201d the university said in a statement to The Post.\n\n\u201cWe stand firmly behind the free movement of genuine and peaceful scholars to share their data globally, as part of our firm commitment to academic freedom and to the open exchange of ideas.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-08", "type": "article"}
