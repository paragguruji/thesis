Let\u2019s also agree we haven\u2019t seen a rollout this clumsy since the debut of ObamaCare, which was far more serious because it penalized millions of Americans while Trump\u2019s order inconvenienced hundreds of foreign nationals.\n\nStill, we can assume, based on past performance, that Trump will learn from the mistakes. His fierce determination to be a successful president cannot co-exist with rookie blunders.\n\nBut what about the other players in the drama? Can we say the media will now correct its excess of bile and cover Trump as a legitimate president and not as an invasive species?\n\nNo, no, no. On the contrary, we must say that Trump aide Steve Bannon was on target when he called the Washington media \u201cthe opposition party.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t take his word for it. Stick a toe into the toxic sludge that passes for straight-news coverage in the Washington Post, the New York Times and others.\n\nLook for the use of tell words like \u201cMuslim ban\u201d to describe an executive order that is no such thing. Look for hero worship of protesters, immigrants, refugees, lawyers rushing to the barricades and congressional critics.\n\nLook, too, at the Twitter feeds of editors and reporters from those papers and the major networks. You\u2019ll see their embrace of everything anti-Trump, further evidence they are part of a movement to obstruct the president, not cover him.\n\nConsider, too, their rediscovered love for Republican Sen. John McCain, a man they ignored during the eight-year reign of their savior, Barack Obama. McCain is again the good maverick because he is bucking the media\u2019s permanent enemy, Republicans.\n\nYet if the media is the opposition party, what is the Democratic Party? It\u2019s supposed to be the loyal opposition, using checks and balances to restrain the president and the excess of one-party rule.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dems are following a dangerously different path. Starting with a wide boycott of the inauguration and including their boycott of committee votes on Trump\u2019s cabinet and their pledge to filibuster any Supreme Court nominee, Democrats resemble a party fomenting a secession movement.\n\nSome call it Trump Derangement Syndrome, but that\u2019s too kind. It\u2019s not a temporarily insane reaction, it\u2019s a calculated plan to wreck the presidency, whatever the cost to the country.\n\nThings never seen in the modern era are now rapidly becoming common. Impeachment talk already is rumbling in the party\u2019s hothouses, and Trump was met with a lawsuit the minute he took the oath.\n\nChuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the top Dems in Congress, led a raucous demonstration Monday night, as if they are community organizers. And Obama couldn\u2019t bear the irrelevance after eight days out of office and felt compelled to encourage disruptions.\n\nThis is Third World behavior and it\u2019s now the M.O. of one of America\u2019s two political parties.\n\nThen there\u2019s California, the epicenter of Dem strength. Radicals there, spurred on by pro-Mexico immigrants, are ginning up an effort to split from the United States and they might get a proposal on the ballot. I say we take their wine and let them go.\n\nsee also Schumer vows to fight Trump's immigration order Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed Sunday to challenge President...\n\nIf California secedes and its 55 electoral votes come off the board, Dems will never win another American election. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton could become president of the breakaway state and the rest of us would be free of the Clinton stain.\n\nSecession is one way the swamp could drain itself. Sally Yates\u2019 way is another.\n\nThe acting attorney general was rightfully sacked the instant after she climbed a soapbox and refused to defend Trump\u2019s executive order in court. It would have been a more admirable gesture if she had the decency to resign. Instead, she thought she could defy the president and keep the job.\n\nHer choice was not a minor act of insubordination. It was a public challenge to the constitutional authority of the president, a power left to Congress and the judiciary.\n\nAs a result, she was shunned and hid in disgrace. Oh, wait, that\u2019s what would happen in a better world.\n\nIn this one, Democrats hailed her as a \u201cpatriot\u201d amid predictions a political star is born.\n\nMy prediction is that Dems are digging their own grave and their revolt against his legitimacy will, in the short term at least, boost Trump\u2019s popularity. Most Americans will conclude he is honestly trying to fulfill the mandate he won and that the fevered rush to destroy him is neither principled nor patriotic.\n\nThere is a catch: Our cultural impatience won\u2019t give Trump endless time or big room for error. He must pick his fights with discretion and wage them with smart, methodical moves that bring clear results.\n\nEqually key, he can\u2019t become a prisoner of Washington. While social media is important, he must get out of town regularly to meet people where they live and remind them that he\u2019s fighting their fights.\n\nHe should continue to court core Democrats, especially members of manufacturing unions and open-minded black and Latino voters.\n\nIf he does all that, and if he\u2019s lucky, America will be great again. That\u2019s what matters.\n\nMayor\u2019s final chance\n\nsee also Preet Bharara to question Mayor de Blasio over City Hall corruption Things are starting to get real for Mayor de Blasio....\n\nPerhaps it was just a poor choice of words, or was it a Freudian slip? Either way, Mayor Bill de Blasio used a curious phrase in describing his planned meeting with federal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThis set of allegations just doesn\u2019t comport with who I am,\u201d he said on NY1. He said he will be \u201csetting the record straight\u201d on investigations into whether he created an illegal pay-to-play scheme.\n\nA fair reading of the \u201cset of allegations\u201d phrase, along with what we know, suggests de Blasio is getting a last chance to convince the feds he shouldn\u2019t face specific criminal charges.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, de Blasio is likely doomed. Such final meetings are routine as prosecutors make sure they haven\u2019t missed important evidence that would gut the case later.\n\nLegal arguments usually fail and political ones always do. New evidence is the only escape hatch.\n\nUnless the mayor is holding an ace in the hole, he\u2019d better be careful. Otherwise, he could talk himself into a perjury charge as well.\n\nCity tax bid hits home\n\nYou think your money is yours, but New York City Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen begs to differ.\n\nCity Hall wants a new \u201cmansion tax\u201d of 2.5 percent on any house sale above $2 million. Asked if she thought the tax might crimp sales, Glen told the Wall Street Journal the criticism is ridiculous and added, \u201cIf you look at how much money we\u2019ve left on the table for the past two years while this thing went sideways, it makes me nuts.\u201d\n\nIn other words, be grateful the city let you keep its money for two years. Now hand it over.\n\nWord of trouble\n\nHeadline: \u201cNorth African gangs attack Chinese migrants in Paris.\u201d\n\nAnother great moment in globalism.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
