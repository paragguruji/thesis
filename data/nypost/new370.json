We\u2019re not going to wait until we get attacked and figure out how it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d Sean Spicer said during a news briefing at the White House, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the key point in this: How do we keep ahead of threats.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed suggestions that intelligence about an impending attack may have prompted Trump\u2019s signing of the executive order that restricts immigrants from seven countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nHe said it wasn\u2019t implemented because of a \u201cspecific threat\u201d but you \u201cnever know when the threat will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why the majority of Americans agree with the president. \u2026 These steps are frankly common-sense steps to make sure we\u2019re never looking at the rear-view mirror asking, \u2018We should have done something,'\u201d he said.\n\nSpicer continued: \u201cHis view is not to wait to get ahead of the curve. We don\u2019t know when that hour comes. We don\u2019t know when the individual comes to do us harm.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Trump has a message for the people who were detained, Spicer said they were only \u201ctemporarily detained.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that people were inconvenienced, obviously, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re talking about a couple of hours,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBeing able to come to America is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Spicer emphasized. \u201cWe have to wait in lines, too.\u201d\n\nHe said after all, 325,000 immigrants came to the country over the weekend and 109 were detained.", "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["seven", "safety", "spicer", "trump", "ban", "immigration", "sean", "wait", "know", "going", "trumps", "defends", "white", "steps", "threat"], "summary": "President Trump signed the executive order to restrict immigration from seven predominately Muslim countries because his priority was the safety of the American people, his White House spokesman said on Monday.\n\u2026 These steps are frankly common-sense steps to make sure we\u2019re never looking at the rear-view mirror asking, \u2018We should have done something,'\u201d he said.\nSpicer continued: \u201cHis view is not to wait to get ahead of the curve.\n\u201cBeing able to come to America is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Spicer emphasized.\n\u201cWe have to wait in lines, too.\u201dHe said after all, 325,000 immigrants came to the country over the weekend and 109 were detained."}
