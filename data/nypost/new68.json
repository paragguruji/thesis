It says the ban is necessary \u201cto ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\u201d\n\nEarlier Saturday, the government officially suspended enforcement of the ban in compliance with the judge\u2019s order, which plunged the new administration into a crisis that has challenged both Trump\u2019s authority and his ability to fulfill campaign promises.\n\nThat stand-down marked an extraordinary setback for the White House. Only a week ago, the president had acted to suspend America\u2019s refugee program and halt immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries that the government said raise terrorism concerns.\n\nThe appeal says the temporary restraining order by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle is a broad overreach of judicial authority.\n\n\u201cJudicial second-guessing of the President\u2019s national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large,\u201d it says. The order also imposes harm on U.S. citizens \u201cby thwarting the legal effect of the public\u2019s chosen representative,\u201d it says.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump mocked Robart, appointed by President George W. Bush, as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d whose \u201cridiculous\u201d ruling \u201cwill be overturned.\u201d He added in a subsequent tweet: \u201cBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision.\u201d\n\nsee also Trump slams 'so-called' judge who blocked travel ban President Trump vowed Saturday to get his controversial travel ban...\n\nTrump\u2019s direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against a federal judge of Mexican heritage who was overseeing a Trump University case. Justice Department lawyers could be called upon to answer for his words as the travel ban case is judged by higher courts.\n\nThe ban has caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompting protests across the United States and leading to multiple court challenges. Demonstrations took place outside the White House, in New York and near Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was spending the weekend and attending an annual American Red Cross fundraising gala.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll win,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday night. \u201cFor the safety of the country, we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe State Department, after initially saying that as many as 60,000 foreigners from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen had their visas canceled, reversed course on Saturday and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa.\n\nThe department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order will now be allowed into the United States. A State Department official said in an email obtained by The Associated Press that the government was \u201cfocusing on booking refugee travel\u201d through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump\u2019s order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \u201csuspended any and all actions\u201d related to putting in place Trump\u2019s order, which the White House argued was \u201cintended to protect the homeland.\u201d\n\nTrump made clear what he thought of Robart\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in & out, especially for reasons of safety & security \u2013 big trouble!\u201d\n\nAfter a pause of several hours, the president returned to Twitter: \u201cWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\u201d\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized Trump for \u201cattempting to bully and disparage yet another federal judge\u201d and said he seemed \u201cintent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric also could put government lawyers defending his order in a tough spot.\n\n\u201cEither they have to defend the statements that Judge Robart is a \u2018so-called judge,\u2019 which you can\u2019t do, or they have to distance themselves from the president, who is their boss,\u201d said University of Pittsburgh law professor Arthur Hellman.\n\nWith legal challenges pending, two prominent Middle Eastern air carriers announced they would resume carrying passengers from the seven affected countries. Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways, national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, said U.S.-bound travelers from those countries with valid visas would be allowed to board.\n\nIn Egypt, Cairo airport and airline officials said they have received instructions from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend President Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nGovernment-backed Qatar Airways is one of a few Mideast airlines operating direct daily flights to multiple American cities. Its U.S. destinations from its Doha hub include New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington.\n\nAt New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, volunteer lawyer Renee Paradis said most of the flights involving passengers from the affected countries were to arrive later Saturday.\n\n\u201cAnybody who comes here on a visa is supposed to be allowed in, so we would anticipate that somebody who is in the air would be able to land and enter,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, as with everything this week, it remains to be seen what happens on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe executive order has caused chaos within the government and the courts. Trump fired Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who was serving as acting attorney general, after she said the Justice Department would not enforce it. In Washington on Saturday, demonstrators chanting \u201cNo hate, No fear, Refugees are welcome here\u201d walked from the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nHearings have also been held in court challenges nationwide.\n\nIn arguments to the court, Washington state and Minnesota said the temporary ban and the global suspension of the U.S. refugee program harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination.\n\nFederal attorneys had argued that Congress gave the president authority to make decisions on national security and immigrant entry.\n\nBut in his written order Friday, Robart said it\u2019s not the court\u2019s job to \u201ccreate policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\u201d but rather, to make sure that an action taken by the government \u201ccomports with our country\u2019s laws.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press", "February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "judges", "trump", "ban", "appeals", "security", "judge", "dept", "united", "halting", "president", "trumps", "justice", "order", "reverse", "department"], "summary": "The Justice Department has appealed a judge\u2019s order temporarily blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration ban, saying it\u2019s the \u201csovereign prerogative\u201d of a president to admit or exclude aliens in order to protect national security.\nA terrible decision.\u201dsee also Trump slams 'so-called' judge who blocked travel ban President Trump vowed Saturday to get his controversial travel ban...Trump\u2019s direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against a federal judge of Mexican heritage who was overseeing a Trump University case.\nJustice Department lawyers could be called upon to answer for his words as the travel ban case is judged by higher courts.\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump\u2019s order from boarding U.S.-bound planes.\nIn Egypt, Cairo airport and airline officials said they have received instructions from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend President Trump\u2019s executive order."}
