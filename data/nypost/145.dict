To put that number in context, we issued over 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year 2015. As always, national security is our top priority when issuing visas,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s order bans refugees entirely and travelers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.\n\nSoon after the executive order was signed, Trump played down its impact by saying only 109 people had been detained at airports in the US.\n\nThe 100,000 figure emerged as part of a lawsuit filed by two Yemeni brothers who arrived at Dulles International Airport last Saturday, suggesting the consequences touch many more people than the White House was ready to admit.\n\nThe Yemeni brothers said they were coerced into giving up their immigrant visas and were quickly put on a return flight to Ethiopia.\n\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said after the hearing that \u201cthere is no legal justification to cancel all these visas.\u201d\n\nsee also More than 100K visas revoked following Trump's immigration ban More than 100,000 visas have been revoked since President Trump\u2019s...\n\nAttorney Erez Reuveni, from the Office of Immigration Litigation at the Civil Division of the Justice Department, said no returning legal permanent residents \u2014 those with green cards \u2014 had been turned away.\n\nThe judge in the case extended a temporary restraining order against removing lawful permanent residents until next Friday.\n\nJudge Leonie M. Brinkema, who presided over the case of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, said she had never seen so much interest in a legal dispute as she has over Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cI have never had so much public outpouring as I\u2019ve seen in this case,\u201d she said, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cThis order touched something in the United States that I\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nShe also slammed the order, while acknowledging that Trump\u2019s executive powers gave him near total control of the borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that not all the thought went into it that should have gone into it,\u201d Brinkema said.\n\n\u201cThere has been chaos . . . without any kind of actual hard evidence that there is a need\u201d to \u00adrevoke visas already granted.\n\nBrinkema said she would not hold government officials in contempt for how they handled travelers from the seven banned countries over the weekend because she did not have enough evidence to make that call.\n\nVirginia lawmakers charged that Customs and Border Protection officers ignored Brinkeman\u2019s order last weekend that immigrants had to have access to lawyers.\n\nThe statements on Friday were the first time the US government had provided detailed counts of the canceled visas.\n\nWith AP", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "type": "article"}
