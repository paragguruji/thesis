Hakeem Jeffries said he\u2019s spoken to Customs and Border Protection officials, as well as the family and friends of those travelers still being detained at JFK.\n\nAnd the International Refugee Assistance Project has been reaching out to lawyers to help with the continuing legal battle.\n\n\u201cBoarder control people were given a list by the congressman,\u201d said Justin Orr, a lawyer volunteering his time to aide the immigrants. \u201cSome people have been here since yesterday morning. Some will be released within the hour and others later. Some of them need to have their paperwork approved by the White House and the permanent residents need approval from local authorities. Most need to be approved by the White House and that is taking a while.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks there are about 10 to 15 people still being held at JFK, but he said \u201cno one will be returned based on the executive order from last night.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing legal battle comes as the Department of Homeland Security said it \u201cwill comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement the president\u2019s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.\u201d\n\nThe emergency motion was filed by Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq, the two Iraqi refugees that were taken into custody at the airport Saturday and later released.\n\nDonnelly\u2019s order halted Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from seven predominately Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.\n\n\u201cThe petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and other similarly situated violates their due process and equal protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution,\u201d her ruling said.\n\nBesides Donnelly\u2019s ruling, other cities and states have taken action to limit or restrict Trump\u2019s order.\n\nFederal court in Washington state issued a stay that prohibits travelers from those countries being send back to their home countries. A federal court in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order saying permanent residents returning from overseas should have access to lawyers while they are being detained and cannot be removed for seven days.\n\nEarly Sunday, federal judges in Boston put a seven-day hold on implementing Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cCustoms and Border Protection shall notify airlines that have flights arriving at Logan Airport of this Order and the fact that individuals on these flights will not be detained or returned based solely on the basis of the Executive Order,\u201d the judges Allison Burroughs and Judith Dein wrote in their decision.\n\nMeanwhile, a flurry of more than 130 volunteer attorneys were scrambling around JFK, filing lawsuits and offering legal advice to those in custody.\n\n\u201cWe have had no contact with the administration and we haven\u2019t been able to contact our clients or help them in interviews,\u201d lawyer Steven Rooke said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
