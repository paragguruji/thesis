But your cluelessness is precisely why he won.\n\nUber first stumbled into a mess when yellow-cab drivers \u2014 rightly \u2014 withheld service from JFK for an hour to protest Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nThe immigration order was cruel, in that it targeted people who already had demonstrated that they respect our immigration laws, having spent years and money securing valid visas to our country only to be sent back to dangerous places from our airports.\n\nUber unwittingly appeared to take Trump\u2019s side. It announced shortly after the strike that it wouldn\u2019t charge \u201csurge pricing\u201d \u2014 higher prices in times of higher demand \u2014 at JFK.\n\nWhat Uber was trying to do was show it wasn\u2019t taking advantage of the protest. Consider: If it had allowed surge pricing, people would say it was using the protest to make more money. (Uber had no mechanism to allow drivers to participate in a location-based protest.)\n\nSo, basically, Uber made a mistake and it tried to rectify it by putting up $3 million to help drivers affected by the immigration order. No real harm, and even some good. After all, does anyone think Uber stifled speech by the taxi (or other) protesters?\n\nNo matter: Some of Uber\u2019s customers were out for blood. Journalist Dan O\u2019Sullivan led the charge, tweeting that Uber should \u201ceat sh - - and die\u201d and exhorting people to \u201cdelete your account.\u201d Susan Sarandon tweeted, \u201cGoodbye, Uber. Hello Lyft.\u201d\n\nParticipating in this mob only demonstrates how much the new Uber-haters live in a bubble.\n\nUber is a tool of the coastal elite. If you pay someone to drive you around more than twice a year, it\u2019s safe to say that you went to college, that you didn\u2019t lose your manufacturing job, or aren\u2019t worried about losing it. As for the \u201cUber VIPs\u201d \u2014 frequent users, sometimes daily \u2014 who reported deleting their accounts: Did they never think, during all of those rides they took yapping on their cellphones, that maybe the fact that Uber has thrived in the past few years is linked to the reason so many people voted for Trump?\n\nYes, some Uber drivers like their set-up. They may have already had a nice car that meets the company\u2019s specifications. They may be in grad school and appreciate the fact that they can work at night and on weekends. They may like the people they meet.\n\nThey don\u2019t mind the fact that Uber offers only contract work, not employment and a chance to move up.\n\nMany Uber drivers, though, drive for Uber because they have no other option \u2014 even sleeping in their cars, because they can\u2019t afford to live near Uber\u2019s customers. They would like a job with room for promotion, a job that offers steady full-time hours and benefits.\n\nAnd they\u2019d like a job that doesn\u2019t require them to go into tens of thousands of debt to buy a high-end vehicle \u2014 debt that makes them, not Uber, the biggest risk-takers in this venture.\n\nThose facts, no doubt, never entered Uber protesters\u2019 minds before last week. Instead, they just enjoyed taking a sleek black car, something many of them couldn\u2019t afford before, not wondering why it was suddenly so affordable.\n\nUber\u2019s customers never seemed worried that the person driving them couldn\u2019t meet his car payment, or that driving a for-hire car is the only job many immigrants can get.\n\nGood thing Uber has spawned competitors that use the same model \u2014 or shunning Uber would hurt these drivers more.\n\nNo, what they\u2019ve thought about instead is, hey, it\u2019s fun to take a car that\u2019s almost as cheap as the subway. Fact is, today\u2019s newfound Uber deleters, and their obliviousness to struggling workers, are the problem \u2014 and a big reason why Trump won.\n\nBy the end of the last week, Uber chief Travis Kalanick, in a panic, said he\u2019d quit Trump\u2019s economic-advisory board. (He had signed up to offer advice, not to support Trump.) But Kalanick needn\u2019t worry. Uber\u2019s customers will be back when there\u2019s a crisis, like the next time it rains.\n\nAs one Uber deleter noted, \u201cI ended up reinstalling it since I don\u2019t have another easy method to pay for nanny\u2019s car home.\u201d\n\nNicole Gelinas is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.", "authors": ["Nicole Gelinas", "February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "car", "ban", "job", "immigration", "wrong", "week", "uber", "trumps", "ubers", "reason", "boycott", "fact", "drivers", "customers"], "summary": "Uber first stumbled into a mess when yellow-cab drivers \u2014 rightly \u2014 withheld service from JFK for an hour to protest Trump\u2019s immigration order.\nYes, some Uber drivers like their set-up.\nMany Uber drivers, though, drive for Uber because they have no other option \u2014 even sleeping in their cars, because they can\u2019t afford to live near Uber\u2019s customers.\nBy the end of the last week, Uber chief Travis Kalanick, in a panic, said he\u2019d quit Trump\u2019s economic-advisory board.\nUber\u2019s customers will be back when there\u2019s a crisis, like the next time it rains."}
