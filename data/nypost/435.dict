It also demands that the company give money to groups fighting the so-called Muslim ban and state publicly that drivers will not be penalized for acting in protest of the ban. It also throws in there that Uber should support its immigrant drivers by adding a tipping option to the app.\n\n\u201cAs a company whose success is built on a foundation of hard work by immigrant workers, Uber can and should do better to stand up for immigrants and their workers,\u201d said IDG founder Jim Conigliaro. \u201cAs a show of solidarity with the thousands of immigrants who helped build this company, we are calling on Uber\u2019s CEO Travis Kalanick to immediately step down from President Trump\u2019s advisory council in protest of his immigration and Muslim travel ban.\u201d\n\nSo far, more than 250 have signed the online petition, with new signatures appearing every minute.\n\nThe petition comes in the midst of the #deleteUber movement, in which disgusted customers have been deleting the app in droves after learning that the company continued to send cars during a taxi strike that was taking place at JFK Airport \u2014 where numerous refugees were being detained over the weekend \u2014 by failing to turn off its app to prevent dropoffs and pickups there.\n\nUber officials responded with words of support for its drivers, but stopped short of saying Kalanick would step down from Trump\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, it\u2019s important that we all support freedom of speech. Like many others, Uber strongly opposes the president\u2019s unjust immigration ban which is harming many innocent people, many of whom are drivers,\u201d said a company spokesperson. \u201cThat\u2019s why we created a $3 million legal defense fund to help, and why we\u2019re offering compensation for lost earnings for any driver stranded abroad. We will continue to stand up for those being hurt by the president\u2019s executive order.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "type": "article"}
