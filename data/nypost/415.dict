That order said their parents were not required to be freed.\n\nTo comply with that order, the Obama administration implemented a policy of holding women and children at family detention centers for no more than 21 days before releasing them.\n\nImplementing the new policy proposal \u201ccould create lifelong psychological trauma,\u201d said Marielena Hincapie, executive director at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cEspecially for children that have just completed a perilous journey from Central America.\u201d\n\nHincapie said the US government is likely to face legal challenges based on immigration and family law if they decide to implement the policy.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week ordered immigration agents to deport or criminally prosecute parents who facilitate the illegal smuggling of their children.\n\nWith Reuters", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-03", "type": "article"}
