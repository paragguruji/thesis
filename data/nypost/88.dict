It would also continue to bar people trying to enter the country through refugee settlement programs.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the ban restricting travel from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen went into effect on June 29.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii said the administration\u2019s \u201cnarrowly defined list\u201d wasn\u2019t supported by law.\n\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nWatson expanded the exemptions \u2013 including not only grandparents but grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law \u2013 and also required refugees in the settlement programs be admitted.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed his ruling.\n\nThe justices\u2019 6-3 decision on Wednesday blocked Watson\u2019s order on the refugees but expanded the list of relatives.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s appointee, wrote that they would have blocked both aspects of Watson\u2019s order. They also said last month that they would have allowed the administration to roll out its full travel ban.\n\nThe high court said the administration\u2019s appeal should be heard by the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco.\n\nTrump signed an executive order instituting the travel ban shortly after his inauguration in January, claiming it was necessary for the security of the country while it examines vetting procedures, but it was soon caught up in the courts.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "type": "article"}
