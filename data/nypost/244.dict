We do not discriminate in this country based on religion.\u201d\n\nKhalilah Ali showed immigration officers pictures of herself with her former husband \u2014 legendary boxer Muhammad Ali \u2014 and they chose not to detain her.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jr. did not have a picture of his father at the time.\n\nPresident Trump signed the travel ban on Jan. 27. A federal judge in Seattle blocked the order a few days before Ali\u2019s flight and the directive is currently ensconced in a legal battle.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection did not comment about Ali\u2019s encounter.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-24", "type": "article"}
