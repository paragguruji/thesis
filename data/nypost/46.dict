Hawaii had requested a temporary restraining order.\n\nHawaii also argued that the ban would prevent residents from receiving visits from relatives in the six countries covered by the order. The state says the ban would harm its tourism industry and the ability to recruit foreign students and workers.\n\nIn Maryland, attorneys told a federal judge that the measure still discriminates against Muslims.\n\nGovernment attorneys argued that the ban was revised substantially to address legal concerns, including the removal of an exemption for religious minorities from the affected countries.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything about religion. It doesn\u2019t draw any religious distinctions,\u201d said Jeffrey Wall, who argued for the Justice Department.\n\nsee also Trump signs revised immigration ban WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed a new executive...\n\nAttorneys for the ACLU and other groups said that Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail and statements from his advisers since he took office make clear that the intent of the ban is to ban Muslims. Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller has said the revised order was designed to have \u201cthe same basic policy outcome\u201d as the first.\n\nThe new version of the ban details more of a national security rationale. It is narrower and eases some concerns about violating the due-process rights of travelers.\n\nIt applies only to new visas from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and temporarily shuts down the U.S. refugee program. It does not apply to travelers who already have visas.\n\n\u201cGenerally, courts defer on national security to the government,\u201d said U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang. \u201cDo I need to conclude that the national security purpose is a sham and false?\u201d\n\nIn response, ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat pointed to Miller\u2019s statement and said the government had put out misleading and contradictory information about whether banning travel from six specific countries would make the nation safer.\n\nThe Maryland lawsuit also argues that it\u2019s against federal law for the Trump administration to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000. Attorneys argued that if that aspect of the ban takes effect, 60,000 people would be stranded in war-torn countries with nowhere else to go.\n\nIn the Hawaii case, the federal government said there was no need to issue an emergency restraining order because Hawaii officials offered only \u201cgeneralized allegations\u201d of harm.\n\nJeffrey Wall of the Office of the Solicitor General challenged Hawaii\u2019s claim that the order violates due-process rights of Ismail Elshikh as a U.S. citizen who wants his mother-in-law to visit his family from Syria. He says courts have not extended due-process rights outside of a spousal relationship.\n\nNeal Katyal, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing Hawaii, called the story of Elshiskh, an Egyptian immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen, \u201cthe story of America.\u201d\n\nWall told the judge that if he is inclined to issue an injunction, it should be tailored specifically to Hawaii and not nationwide.\n\nIn Washington state, U.S. District Judge James Robart \u2014 who halted the original ban last month \u2014 heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which is making arguments similar to the ACLU\u2019s in the Maryland case.\n\nRobart said he is most interested in two questions presented by the group\u2019s challenge to the ban: whether the ban violates federal immigration law, and whether the affected immigrants would be \u201cirreparably harmed\u201d should the ban go into effect.\n\nHe spent much of Wednesday afternoon\u2019s hearing grilling the lawyers about two seeming conflicting federal laws on immigration \u2014 one which gives the president the authority to keep \u201cany class of aliens\u201d out of the country, and another that forbids the government from discriminating on the basis of nationality when it comes to issuing immigrant visas.\n\nRobart said he would issue a written order, but he did not say when. He is also overseeing the challenge brought by Washington state.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson argues that the new order harms residents, universities and businesses, especially tech companies such as Washington state-based Microsoft and Amazon, which rely on foreign workers. California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon have joined the claim.\n\nWashington and Hawaii say the order also violates the First Amendment, which bars the government from favoring or disfavoring any religion. On that point, they say, the new ban is no different than the old. The states\u2019 First Amendment claim has not been resolved.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate the original ban but did not rule on the discrimination claim.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "type": "article"}
