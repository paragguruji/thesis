How is this wall that is immense going to go through the many rivers? Are you going to build dams? Are you going to go up and down the mountains?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFrom Dusk til Dawn\u201d star hinted that she thinks the border wall may be a diversion tactic.\n\n\u201cSometimes we talk about the wrong part of the issues,\u201d Hayek noted. \u201cAnd that can be a trick, talking about the wrong part of the issue and not dealing with it, or talking about the wrong issues, which distract from other issues \u2014 we have to be careful not to fall in that trap.\u201d\n\nsee also Salma Hayek, Mexico unite against Trump at Guadalajara The actress alongside director Jim Sheridan and Mexican authorities backing...\n\n\u201cWe have to talk about smart reforms because it\u2019s very necessary,\u201d the actress, who moved to the United States from Mexico in 1991, urged. \u201cThere are smarter ways we can come up with to control immigration and do immigration reform that is much more beneficial for America.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, there\u2019s a lot of work for farmers in this country and there are not enough farmers for all the work there is,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the people that do not want to be involved in the drug industry of Mexico are very skilled farmers; they do not want to participate in that, so some of them are here.\u201c\n\n\u201cThe people that come \u2014 they don\u2019t necessarily want to stay,\u201d she added. \u201cThey would be happy to come and work at the time of the harvest and go back to their country. America can benefit from these expert workers and they can pay taxes that can benefit America.\u201d", "authors": ["April"], "publish_date": "2017-04-26", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["salma", "mexico", "issues", "wall", "dumb", "slams", "wrong", "going", "trumps", "work", "border", "talking", "come", "farmers", "hayek"], "summary": "Salma Hayek didn\u2019t mince words when discussing President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dumb solution and proposition,\u201d Hayek, 50, told People in an interview released Wednesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about who\u2019s going to pay for it and the wall is not the solution.\n\u201cSometimes we talk about the wrong part of the issues,\u201d Hayek noted.\n\u201cThey would be happy to come and work at the time of the harvest and go back to their country."}
