They are nervous and upset. My daughters keep saying to me: \u201cYou promised to take us to see the Frozen characters, when we will go?\u201d\n\nThey were put on a plane back to Saudi Arabia at 6 pm on Jan. 28.

He walked away. I assume he went through all my emails, messages, Facebook conversations, SMS texts, and private images on my cell phone because he referenced some things later that he would not know if he had not done this.\u201d\n\nAs Aburomman sat in a crowded room, his brother waited on the other side with an attorney, trying to get him out, but were repeatedly told he was gone.\n\nAs he sat on the airplane back to Jordan at 3:50 p.m. on Jan. 29, texting with his attorney, he realized that the \u201cofficer who placed me on the airplane had the same\n\nname as the officer who told my attorney that I had \u201calready left.\u201d\n\nNabila Alhaffar lives in Virginia with her husband, she says, who is a doctor.\n\nThe Syrian National was stopped at Dulles on Jan. 28, and told her papers were \u201cblocked.\u201d\n\nShe was then sat down and ordered to sign papers, but became agitated when she asked for a translator because she doesn\u2019t read English well.\n\nAfter asking for her documents back, she was yelled at by a border agent before being stuck on a plane back to Qatar at 9:55 a.m. on Jan 29.\n\n\u201cYou are not American,\u201d he allegedly shrieked. \u201cYou cannot say \u2018my visa\u2019 because this visa belongs to the United States, not to you! You must go back to your country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am currently in Qatar, my visa having been cancelled, separated from my husband who is working in the United States as a physician, not knowing when I can see my husband again,\u201d she writes.\n\nTwo of the accounts are from women who have successfully re-entered the U.S.\u2013Sara Yarjani and Suha Abushamma\u2013and whose cases have been covered before.\n\nAbushamma, a Sudanese national and Cleveland Clinic resident who was detained at JFK for nine hours before being sent back to Saudi Arabia, returned to the country Monday.\n\nHer attorneys have since filed a motion to dismiss her suit against Trump, though it remains unclear if she\u2019ll join the proposed class action currently brewing in Brooklyn Federal Court, lead by Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi.\n\nThe first-person accounts were published as part of Darweesh and Alshawi\u2019s lawsuit.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["stopped", "travel", "national", "ban", "immigrants", "jan", "told", "officer", "family", "saudi", "trumps", "border", "detained", "daughters", "visa"], "summary": "A newly released filing in Brooklyn federal court reveals the ordeals of travelers across the country who were detained and then deported following President Trump\u2019s immigration ban.\nBrooklyn Federal Court Justice Ann Donnelly issued a partial stay on Trump\u2019s travel ban just before 9:00p.m.\nSyrian National Yahya Aburomman, flew from Jordan to Chicago to visit his brother, was held at Chicago O\u2019Hare on Jan. 29.\n\u201cYou cannot say \u2018my visa\u2019 because this visa belongs to the United States, not to you!\nAbushamma, a Sudanese national and Cleveland Clinic resident who was detained at JFK for nine hours before being sent back to Saudi Arabia, returned to the country Monday."}
