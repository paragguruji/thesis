But the actual executive order hit the young Nets standout far harder.\n\n\u201cWe try to teach people not to point the finger, blame a whole [group]. You can\u2019t judge a whole group by one\u2019s actions at the end of the day. And I feel like that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s definitely not right,\u2019\u2019 Hollis-Jefferson said Saturday before they faced the Timberwolves. \u201cYou can\u2019t speak for all Muslims, because all Muslims\u2019 hearts aren\u2019t like that. Most of them are pure, really believe in a different way and a different livelihood.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Hollis-Jefferson had to look away at the Target Center wall, and compose himself, apologizing for getting emotional.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of hard. My bad. This is kind of touching \u2026 just being a part of that community and a part of that family,\u2019\u2019 Hollis-Jefferson said. \u201cI feel like this should definitely be handled differently, and I feel like more people should definitely speak up and act on it just because it\u2019s BS at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for the next 90 days. It also denies entry to all refugees from the countries \u2014 of which the combined population exceeds 130 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nsee also Muslim ex-Knick after Trump ban: Today I found out I'm hated The refugee ban that President Donald Trump signed Friday echoed...\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like things could be handled differently. Me being Muslim, me knowing a lot of Muslims, it\u2019s definitely, definitely heartbreaking to see,\u2019\u2019 said Hollis-Jefferson, who was born in Pennsylvania. \u201cA lot of my college friends are Muslims, and their families are in some of those countries. Just seeing that, my heart goes out to them, how they feel about it and everything. It\u2019s definitely a tough situation to put people in.\u201d\n\nDuring the Republican campaign, Trump had called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out what is going on.\u201d Asked if he thought there was an element of fear in the Muslim community, or a chance Trump\u2019s actions could incite bad feelings, Hollis-Jefferson said there was.\n\n\u201cYeah, I believe so, just because, again, I feel like he\u2019s targeting people and singling people out, and then it\u2019s making it as a whole,\u2019\u2019 Hollis-Jefferson said. \u201cBut this country or these group of people may feel like, \u2018Why are you doing this to us?\u2019 then \u2018My family is there\u2019 and etc.\n\n\u201cHim making that decision, it\u2019s just like a big step, you know? Super big. And it definitely affects millions of people, definitely, even ones that aren\u2019t Muslim. People have a heart, people care. It\u2019s just sad to see.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "type": "article"}
