President Trump has made clear that one purpose of the Order is to favor Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,\u201d the states said.\n\nThe legal maneuvers from the two states follow a number of briefs filed by leading technology companies\u2014including Apple, Ebay, Facebook, Google and Microsoft\u2014against the ban, saying the order actually encourages businesses to move their operations overseas because it makes it more difficult for them to attract talented workers to the US.\n\n\u201cThe Order effects a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies,\u201d they claim.\n\nA number of former US officials, Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright among them, filed a statement early Monday backing Washington and Minnesota in their legal battle.\n\n\u201cWe view the Order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d the officials said. \u201cIt could do long-term damage to our national security and foreign policy interest, endangering US troops in the field and disrupting counterterrorism and national security partnerships.\u201d\n\nIn their filing to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Minnesota and Washington said the court would \u201cunleash chaos again by staying the district court order. The Court should decline.\u201d\n\nUS District Court Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s immigration ban on Friday.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to rant against Robart, calling him a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and the decision \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn its appeal, the government said the president has the power to decide who can enter the United States.\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals could rule on the issue as early as today and has requested the government respond to the briefs by 6 p.m.\n\nWith Post Wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
