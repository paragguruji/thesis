Things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.\u201d\n\nBut he tried to hold himself back from an all-out attack on the court. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to call a court biased,\u201d he said.\n\nThe appeals court is expected to issue its ruling this week on whether to overturn a Washington state federal court order blocking the travel ban.\n\nTrump justified his restriction by saying it\u2019s a national security concern. \u201cI think our security is at risk,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, Trump said terrorism was on the rise, but, he pledged, he\u2019ll \u201ctake care\u201d of it.\n\nThe president also reiterated his pledge to the cops and sheriffs that he\u2019ll build a border wall with Mexico.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say, \u2018Oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t kidding. I don\u2019t kid,\u201d he said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "type": "article"}
