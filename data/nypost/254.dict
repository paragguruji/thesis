Camille Habel, a spokeswoman with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told NPR there\u2019s been \u201cquite an increase in people walking through illegally.\u201d\n\nShe said after the border-crosser is arrested, they can be detained for up to 24 hours before they\u2019re released or presented in front of a judge.\n\nImmigrants may be avoiding official entry points because they risk being turned away \u2014 or given over to US authorities.\n\nThe illegal crossings are happening all along the Canadian border, but the largest influx is into Quebec, according to NPR.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-17", "type": "article"}
