A showdown in the Supreme Court is likely next.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\u201d wrote chief judge Roger Gregory.\n\n\u201cCongress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,\u201d the ruling said.\n\nThe 10-3 decision upheld the March ruling of a federal court in Maryland that said the ban violated the Constitution because it discriminates against Muslims.\n\nThat Maryland court in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union considered Trump\u2019s heated campaign rhetoric calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the country until the government could \u201cfigure out what is going on\u201d and concluded the order issued on March 6 was discriminatory.\n\nTrump defended his comments as necessary to protect national security.\n\nBut the court said there were \u201cstrong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban,\u201d the court ruled.\n\nThe ACLU praised the ruling on Thursday.\n\n\u200b\u201d\u200bPresident Trump\u2019s Muslim ban violates the Constitution, as this decision strongly reaffirms,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case.\n\n\u200bTrump signed his initial executive order from Jan. 27 banning immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries \u2013 Iraq was included in the first version \u2013 and it sparked protests and stranded thousands of travelers at airports across the country.\n\nA federal judge in Seattle knocked down the order saying it violated due process protections because it didn\u2019t give travelers advance notice.\n\n\u200bThe Trump administration then revised the order and narrowed its scope, but a federal judge in Hawaii\u200b on March 15 \u200bblocked it saying its intent was clear.\n\n\u200b\u200bJudge Derrick Watson\u200b \u200bwrote that a \u201creasonable, objective observer\u201d would see the order as \u201cissued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe government is appealing the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California.\n\nWith Post wires", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "type": "article"}
