They increasingly imagine an unwelcoming place where a virtual wall, not quite Mexican border-style, keeps these type-A foreign workers out.\n\n\u201cThis is going to hurt Wall Street,\u201d Julissa Arce, 33, a former Goldman Sachs staffer in structured finance in New York, told The Post. \u201cIt also creates uncertainties for some employees themselves, who don\u2019t know if their visas will be renewed.\u201d\n\nArce knows the feeling well. A native of Mexico and a US college grad, she once kept her real identify as an undocumented worker at Goldman carefully hidden from her bosses.\n\nLast week, Arce spoke about efforts to undercut the American Dream for other undocumented pros.\n\n\u201cMy family and I are very proud of what I was able to accomplish, despite the fact I was undocumented,\u201d Arce said. \u201cLost in my story is that I am not the only person who has had a successful career in a professional setting, despite having been undocumented. I just wish the path was not as filled with so many challenges.\u201d\n\nThe overhaul of US immigration policy being considered by the Trump administration includes sharp reductions in H-1B visas from the current 84,000 annually, which is fueling much of the anxiety.\n\nGoldman, like other Street firms, as a policy does not hire employees without green cards, legal residence or US citizenship.\n\nStill, Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, recently weighed in on President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict immigration from seven countries.\n\nBlankfein, in a reported voicemail to the firm\u2019s 34,000 employees, said the effort was a policy the firm could not support.\n\nsee also Former Goldman exec warns against curtailing H-1B visas Julissa Arce, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has her own...\n\nThe Trump action is presently blocked, in part, by federal courts.\n\nHuman resources managers across the Street are seeking guidance. This month, a webinar on immigration reform hosted by the Corporate Executive Board (CEB), a research and advisory services firm for Wall Street and others, drew a record 2,000 HR executives, as much as a fourfold increase over CEB\u2019s typical webinar participation rate.\n\n\u201cCompanies are struggling with the sheer uncertainty of what happens on immigration, for professionals coming in on work visas,\u201d said Brian Kropp, the HR practice manager at CEB, noting how there are as many as 1 million professionals overall in the US on professional visas. And as many as 15 percent of employees in the US tech industry, which bolsters the fortunes and back offices of Wall Street, may be here on these same professional visas, he added.\n\nFormer Goldman staffer Arce says immigration restrictions on financial professionals could have long-term, damaging consequences.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t smell like US immigration reform,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom my perspective, it seems like we are going backwards.\u201d\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-26", "type": "article"}
