An en banc hearing would bring more judges into the case.\n\n\u201cThe judge must provide a memorandum explaining the reasons for the call for a vote,\u201d said William Jacobson of Cornell Law School, publisher of the Legal Insurrection Web site. \u201cBut we don\u2019t get to see it.\u201d\n\nThe move set off fevered speculation among legal experts.\n\n\u201cWhat I read into it is one judge eager to write a dissent,\u201d tweeted Laurence Tribe, a constitutional-law professor at Harvard Law School.\n\n\u201cIt could be that a judge thinks this is of such importance and is getting such press coverage that the full court needs to vote whether to hear it en banc,\u201d Jacobson told The Post.\n\nThe move also may be an attempt to send up a flare to the US Supreme Court, Jacobson said.\n\n\u201cIt could be a signal to the Supreme Court that there\u2019s a judge on the court who is very concerned about this, that maybe you\u2019d better consider taking this,\u201d he said.\n\nSome observers also speculate that the anonymous judge backs the decision \u2014 and the request for an en banc hearing is actually a tactical move to keep it in place.\n\nJacobson explained that the anonymous judge might want \u201cabout a tactical motive, \u201csuch as a judge who likes the decision and wants to keep the executive order non-operative pending further appeals processes.\u201d\n\nWithout such an action, he said, the case could go back to the district court for trial \u2014 where the Trump administration might ultimately prevail.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
