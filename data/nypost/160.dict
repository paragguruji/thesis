If Democrats take the House with anything like a comfortable majority, they will be hard-pressed to resist their base\u2019s drive to give Trump a mark of dishonor shared only by Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.\n\nPresidents have been hated by the other side before, but rarely with this sort of intensity and immediacy. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln (seven Southern states seceded before he took office), it usually takes time for critics to work up a good, unbridled loathing. Hoover had to preside over the beginning of the Great Depression. Nixon had to bomb Cambodia and get embroiled in Watergate.\n\nDonald Trump just had to show up.\n\nThe left\u2019s anti-Trump rhetoric has been catastrophist from the beginning. The initial travel ban represented a constitutional crisis. So did the firing of acting attorney general Sally Yates. And so, of course, did the cashiering of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe, once frequently mentioned as a potential Democratic Supreme Court pick, wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago entitled, \u201cTrump Must Be Impeached.\u201d Must doesn\u2019t allow for wiggle room. Tribe maintains that \u201cimpeachable offenses could theoretically have been charged from the outset of this presidency.\u201d\n\nLeft-wing New York Times columnist Charles Blow writes about \u201cthe critical and increasingly urgent question for many: Will Trump be impeached \u2014 or indicted \u2014 and when? The anticipation has produced a throbbing anxiety. There is so much emotional investment in Trump\u2019s removal that I fear that it blinds people to the fact that it is a long shot and, in any case, a long way off.\u201d\n\nYes, impeachment might have to wait till early 2019. Who has the patience?\n\nIt may be that Democrats don\u2019t take the House, or even if they do, they pull up short on impeachment. A House impeachment vote would almost certainly only be a symbolic gesture. The chances of getting the two-thirds of the Senate necessary to remove Trump from office are close to nil, unless there\u2019s an offense that collapses his support among Republican senators.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been cautious, saying that impeachment has to be a factual, not an emotional project. But it may be that impeachment becomes de facto Democratic orthodoxy whether the party\u2019s leadership likes it or not. The grassroots group MoveOn.org has already called for it (even before Comey\u2019s testimony).\n\nWhat would Democrats impeach Trump for? This is a question of mere details. They\u2019ll surely find a case somewhere amidst the feverish allegations of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and violations of the emoluments clause.\n\nThere\u2019s always a danger of over-reaching. Democrats in Wisconsin ended up pushing swing voters toward Gov. Scott Walker with their all-out resistance and attempted recall. Republicans paid a price for impeaching Bill Clinton in the 1990s, if they still won the presidency two years later.\n\nUntil further notice, though, any point scored against Trump in the Russia controversy or any political gain by the Democrats has to be considered another step toward impeachment. The White House needs to realize the gravity of the situation, and so should the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s boast that he would be willing to contradict Comey under oath is, if sincere, incredibly reckless. This isn\u2019t like playing cat-and-mouse games with reporters in his days as a celebrity businessman, or jousting with Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the media. Any mis-step \u2014 any contestable claim or outright falsehood \u2014 can and will be used against him in an impeachment proceeding.\n\nPerhaps we ultimately won\u2019t get there, because cooler heads will prevail. But who, having watched American politics over the last 18 months, has any confidence in that happening?", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "type": "article"}
