And that happened. It happened in Europe, mainly in Germany,\u201d Bashar al-Assad said in a radio interview, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cI think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming.\u201d It was \u201cnot against the Syrian people,\u201d Assad said about Trump\u2019s executive order, which includes Syria as one of the seven countries barred from sending immigrants to the US.\n\nTrump has said his travel ban, which has been put on hold by a federal appeals court, will help secure America\u2019s borders from terrorists.\n\n\u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world \u2013 a horrible mess!\u201d the president tweeted last month defending his order.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
