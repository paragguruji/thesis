The movie is about a fish separated from her family who gets caught and quarantined in her search for them.\n\nCritics couldn\u2019t help but point out the irony as protesters were accusing the Trump Administration of keeping families apart through airport detentions.\n\n\u201cFinding Dory is the story of someone unlawfully detained while trying to visit her family,\u201d tweeted one user, Jason Sparks.\n\nPresident Trump Friday imposed a ban on Syrian refugees and issued a temporary prohibition of citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nTrump campaigned on the ban and believes it\u2019s necessary for American security.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
