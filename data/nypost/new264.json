He backed me big-time but I wasn\u2019t interested in taking all of his calls,\u201d Trump tweeted early Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s not smart enough to run for president!\u201d\n\nCuban, a frequent Trump critic who backed Hillary Clinton for president, initially responded on Twitter with a simple laugh.\n\n\u201cLol,\u201d the billionaire tweeted.\n\nBut then Cuban upped his attack, writing \u201cHow soon they forget\u201d in a tweet that included comments he made in a May 2016 email criticizing Trump\u2019s pursuit of the presidency.\n\n\u201cYou have a real chance to win. But to make it work you have to really dig in on the issues,\u201d Cuban said, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bore people with details.\u201d\n\nThat email included a dare that may yet come true for possible presidential candidate Cuban.\n\n\u201cEveryone else is afraid of you. I like to challenge you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd like you said, I may go after that job some day and it could be against you. So it helps to get a head.\u201d\n\nThen, responding to a tweet about what prompted Trump\u2019s sudden Twitter strike, Cuban said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. But isn\u2019t it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern?\u201d\n\nThe Post on Sunday reported that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has asked for the names of potential Democratic challengers to Trump in 2020.\n\nCuban made the list along with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nThe report, citing sources, said the White House\u2019s \u201cbiggest fear\u201d was Cuban because he would appeal to Republicans and independents.\n\n\u201cAnd Mark is the kind of guy who would drop half a billion dollars of his own money on the race,\u201d a source told The Post.\n\nTrump is known to have a fast Twitter finger, posting comments about news articles and interviews on cable news shows.\n\nOn Friday, Cuban made comments in the Star-Telegram of Fort Worth, Texas, warning American CEOs to be careful in their dealings with the president.\n\n\u201cDo what you think is right,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBe an American citizen first. In the bigger scheme of things, our country benefits from peaceful activism a lot more than it benefits from one more shoe being sold, or one more basketball ticket being sold, for that matter.\u201d\n\nTrump kicked off his Sunday morning tweetstorm from Florida by defending his immigration policies and bashing a federal \u201ccourt breakdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise,\u201d Trump tweeted early in the morning. \u201cGang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\u201d\n\nThis weekend, as Trump worked from his Mar-a-Lago resort, immigrant rights groups protested in Arizona, New York and elsewhere against recent deportations and immigration raids under Trump\u2019s crackdown.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned the judicial branch after unfavorable rulings on his travel ban, which remains on hold.\n\nThe president also continued to push back against an appeals court\u2019s ruling to continue halting his travel ban on citizens from seven countries and refugees.\n\n\u201c72% of refugees admitted into U.S. (2/3 -2/11) during COURT BREAKDOWN are from 7 countries: SYRIA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, IRAN, SUDAN, LIBYA & YEMEN.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet lowered the estimate of refugees entering the country after an analysis from the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump apparently was responding to some news reports that pegged the percentage of refugees coming from the seven banned, mainly Muslim countries at 77 percent.\n\n\u201cOur legal system is broken! \u201877% of refugees allowed into US since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.\u2019 (WT) SO DANGEROUS!\u201d he said.\n\nHe also went after one of his favorite targets and claimed CNN cut off Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 interview because the Vermont independent called the cable network \u201cfake news.\u201d Sanders said he was joking and CNN called Trump\u2019s allegations \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nIn a busy Twitter morning, Trump also praised his interaction with the Japanese prime minister, who had been visiting him at the \u201cwinter White House\u201d this weekend.\n\n\u201cAfter two days of very productive talks, Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe is heading back to Japan,\u201d Trump tweeted from his Palm Beach resort.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["potus", "seven", "travel", "trump", "cuban", "rages", "mark", "donald", "twitter", "trumps", "countries", "tweeted", "run", "refugees", "white"], "summary": "He backed me big-time but I wasn\u2019t interested in taking all of his calls,\u201d Trump tweeted early Sunday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not smart enough to run for president!\u201dCuban, a frequent Trump critic who backed Hillary Clinton for president, initially responded on Twitter with a simple laugh.\nSo it helps to get a head.\u201dThen, responding to a tweet about what prompted Trump\u2019s sudden Twitter strike, Cuban said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\n\u201877% of refugees allowed into US since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.\u2019 (WT) SO DANGEROUS!\u201d he said.\n\u201cAfter two days of very productive talks, Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe is heading back to Japan,\u201d Trump tweeted from his Palm Beach resort."}
