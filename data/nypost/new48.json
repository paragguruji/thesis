Bush, Gorsuch said case law has to be respected.\n\n\u201c\u200bBut as a judge, it\u2019s [both cases] a precedent of the United States Supreme Court and it deserves the same respect as other precedents of the United States Supreme Court when you\u2019re coming to it as a judge, and it has to be analyzed under the law of precedents,\u201d he \u200bsaid\u200b.\n\nSen.
