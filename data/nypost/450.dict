Until we defeat it, everyone traveling in or to Texas needs to be aware of what\u2019s in store for them,\u201d said ACLU of Texas executive director Terri Burke in a statement. \u201cThe Lone Star State will become a \u2018show me your papers\u2019 state, where every interaction with law enforcement can become a citizenship interrogation and potentially an illegal arrest.\u201d\n\nThe bill, known as SB4, also bans \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in the state by requiring cops and elected officials to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott officially signed the bill on Sunday in a Facebook Live broadcast.\n\nThe new law doesn\u2019t take effect until September, but the ACLU says it \u201cis concerned that some law enforcement officers may begin to treat residents and travelers unfairly now.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU previously issued a travel warning to Arizona after a similar law was enacted there in 2010.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-05-09", "type": "article"}
