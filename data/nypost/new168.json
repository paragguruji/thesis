The state asked Watson, who blocked the president\u2019s revised travel ban in March, to clarify that those family members are also exempt from the ban.\n\nWatson rejected Hawaii\u2019s request, saying the state should go to the U.S. Supreme Court since it was seeking to clarify that court\u2019s requirement of a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d\n\nHawaii appealed Watson\u2019s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court said Watson\u2019s ruling was not appealable under federal judicial laws. The 9th Circuit, however, said Watson had the authority to interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s order and block any violation of it. Hawaii then renewed its last week request with Watson in a different form.\n\n\u201cBecause plaintiffs now seek such injunctive relief, the court reaches the merits of their request, consistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s guidance,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nThe Hawaii attorney general\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately comment on Watson\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment Thursday.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "July"], "publish_date": "2017-07-14", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["list", "ruling", "travel", "trump", "ban", "expands", "family", "watsons", "judge", "supreme", "court", "relatives", "exempted", "request", "watson", "grandparents"], "summary": "HONOLULU \u2014 A federal judge in Hawaii on Thursday expanded the list of family relationships needed by people seeking new visas from six mostly Muslim countries to avoid President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson said in his ruling.\nThe state asked Watson, who blocked the president\u2019s revised travel ban in March, to clarify that those family members are also exempt from the ban.\nCircuit Court of Appeals, but the court said Watson\u2019s ruling was not appealable under federal judicial laws.\nThe Hawaii attorney general\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately comment on Watson\u2019s ruling."}
