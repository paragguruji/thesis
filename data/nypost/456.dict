I can\u2019t go back,\u201d Hameed Khalid Darweesh, 53, said.\n\nAsked if he\u2019d be killed in Iraq, he answered: \u201cYes, yes.\u201d\n\nDarweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, were both marked for death back home after they or their family members worked with American forces.\n\nBoth men had waited two years for permission to come to the United States \u2014 only to be plucked out at JFK and held for hours Saturday as Customs officials put them through \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\nAlshawi credited protesters for his release. \u201cWithout this pressure I believe I would have to return\u201d to Iraq, said Alshawi. He hasn\u2019t seen his wife or son in three years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hug them for a long time,\u201d Alshawi said.\n\nOne protester chirped, \u201cWelcome to New York!\u201d as Darweesh was released midday Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is humanity. This is the soul of America,\u201d Darweesh said. \u201cThis is what pushed me to leave my country and come here and I\u2019m very, very thankful to all the people who came to support me.\u201d\n\nHis first request: a cigarette.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t smoke for 50 hours,\u201d he said, laughing as he lit it up.\n\nThe longtime interpreter for the Army was heading to Charlotte, NC, with his wife and kids when Customs agents stopped him.\n\nAsked about Trump, Darweesh said cautiously, \u201cI like him, but I don\u2019t know. This is the policy. He is the president.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
