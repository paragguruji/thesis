That was my early birthday present,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nWhile none of the 16-year-old\u2019s family was directly affected by the ban, it has placed any future travel plans in limbo.\n\n\u201cFortunately, none of my family was traveling. It did affect the fact that my joon joon [grandmother] was possibly coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of been halted until we assess what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota native, whose first language was Farsi, said that despite the ruling, it\u2019s still hard to get a handle on exactly what is happening.\n\n\u201cIt goes from, \u2018it\u2019s happening,\u2019 to \u2018no, it\u2019s postponed,\u2019 to, \u2018oh, it\u2019s temporarily postponed,\u2019 to \u2018how temporary is the postponement? When are we going to get rid of it?\u2019 So I feel like it\u2019s just hard to adjust and keep up,\u201d she admitted.\n\nOn Thursday, three federal appeals judges unanimously upheld a decision that halted the president\u2019s refugee and immigration ban. The decision prompted a shrill rebuke from Trump on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d he wrote shortly after news of the decision broke.", "source": "Page Six", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "type": "article"}
