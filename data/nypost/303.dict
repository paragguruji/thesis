If we have to, we\u2019ll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California.\n\n\u201cCalifornia in many ways is out of control, as you know,\u201d he continued. \u201cObviously, the voters agree or otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have voted for me.\u201d\n\nLess than a week after Trump\u2019s executive order that bans immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, California proposed becoming a \u201csanctuary state\u201d that would hinder efforts to deport illegal immigrants by not cooperating with federal authorities.\n\nComplicating Trump\u2019s plan is that California is one of several \u201cdonor states\u201d that pay more to the US government than they receive in federal funds.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump set off a firestorm of controversy when he responded to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin being a \u201ckiller\u201d by saying, \u201cWe got a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?\u201d\n\nPressed by O\u2019Reilly that he didn\u2019t know of any government officials who were killers, Trump said, \u201cWell, take a look at what we\u2019ve done, too. We\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. I\u2019ve been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe remarks prompted the top Senate Republican to say there\u2019s no \u201cequivalency\u201d between Russia and the United States.\n\n\u201cHe is a former KGB agent, a thug, not elected in a way that most people consider a credible election,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nTrump also defended the rollout of his executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations, which launched protests at airports across the country and stranded hundreds of green-card holders.\n\n\u201cI think it was smooth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully.\u201d\n\nThe State Department said as many as 60,000 foreigners from those seven countries have been affected since the ban was first implemented over a week ago.\n\nOf the nuclear deal former President Barack Obama negotiated with Iran, Trump said he might tear up the agreement.\n\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cI can say this, they have total disregard for our country, they are the No. 1 terrorist state, they\u2019re sending money all over the place \u2014 and weapons. And \u2014 can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t refute reports that he offered to let the US military stop Mexican drug cartels in a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something about the cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to help him with it.\u201d\n\nHe also said Americans can expect a tax cut by the end of the year and predicted there will be big changes to ObamaCare by next year.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "type": "article"}
