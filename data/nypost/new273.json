Such an arrangement would enable him to visit the Isle of Lewis, where his mother, Mary MacLeod, was born in 1912.\n\nBut a visit to Scotland also would raise delicate political issues for the nationalist government led by Nicola Sturgeon, which would have to decide whether to boycott Trump or not.\n\nTwo of Trump\u2019s modern presidential predecessors \u2014 Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton \u2014 have addressed the joint houses in the royal gallery. Only Barack Obama, in 2011, has made a speech in the 11th-century Westminster Hall.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["cancels", "british", "address", "trump", "royal", "plan", "visiting", "visit", "bercow", "veto", "westminster", "parliament", "trumps"], "summary": "The British government pulled the plug Friday on a planned address by President Trump to the joint Houses of Parliament during a state visit \u2013 a decision that followed a kerfuffle between two house speakers.\nCommons Speaker John Bercow this week said Trump should not be allowed to address Parliament because of his immigration ban as well as the UK\u2019s \u201copposition to racism and to sexism.\u201dSome Parliament members applauded his remarks, while others called on him to step down.\nBoth men have veto power over proposals for visiting leaders to address Parliament.\nTrump also might be encouraged to spend more time in Scotland, where he could visit the Queen at Balmoral Castle.\nTwo of Trump\u2019s modern presidential predecessors \u2014 Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton \u2014 have addressed the joint houses in the royal gallery."}
