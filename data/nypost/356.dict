There has been just as much coverage of the law (order) as the protests themselves.\u201d\n\nShanahan said public backlash would show Muslims that Trump\u2019s order wasn\u2019t popular with everyone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this plays into the hands of ISIS, who are on the backfoot, or al Qaeda, who are too busy fighting ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a masterstroke of propaganda, it\u2019s not a game-changer.\u201d\n\nShanahan said jihadis have been saying the West hates Muslims for a long time and their messages were not new.\n\n\u201cIs this executive order ridiculous? Yes. Has it been shambolic? Yes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut will it have the intended (propaganda) effect jihadis believe? I doubt it.\u201d\n\nThe order has not been received well in the countries affected by the ban, with Iraq threatening to do the same thing in retaliation.\n\nIran has also blasted the order, with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warning Iran will take similar measures to protect its citizens.\n\nOn Twitter, Zarif called the move discriminatory and said he believed it would play into the hands of extremists.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who control the capital, Sanaa, released a statement saying, \u201cAll attempts to classify Yemen and its citizens as a probable source for terrorism and extremism is illegal and illegitimate,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nISIS deadline\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has given his advisers 30 days to come up with a plan to defeat the Islamic State and wipe it off the planet.\n\nTrump repeatedly pledged to eradicate the extremist group during the presidential campaign.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the plan to defeat ISIS would involve cyber-activity, stopping money laundering as well as making a deal with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s view is, \u2018I am not going to wait,\u2019\u201d Spicer said.\n\n\u201c\u2019I am going to make sure we protect the homeland and the people with every measure. If ISIS is left in power, the threat it poses only grows.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe know that it has the ability to have chemical weapons and it attacks against our partner and allies continues to mount.\n\n\u201cThe United States must take decisive action and is taking the necessary steps.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilitary strike\n\nIt also emerged that the first US service member has died in the first military action authorized by Trump.\n\nThree service members were also wounded Sunday during the firefight with militants from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\u2019s branch in Yemen, AP reported.\n\nA fourth US service member was injured when a military aircraft assisting in the mission had a \u201chard landing\u201d nearby, according to US Central Command.\n\nThe raid was planned as a clandestine operation and not intended to be made public, but the loss of a service member changed that, a US official said, adding that no detainees were taken in the operation.\n\nAn al Qaeda official and an online news service linked to the terror group said the raid left about 30 people dead, including women and children.\n\nAmong the children killed was Anwaar, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki.\n\nNasser al-Awlaki said the girl was visiting her mother when the raid took place. She was shot in the neck and bled for two hours before she died, he said.\n\nSpicer expressed his condolences to the family of the soldier and said US forces \u201ccaptured a whole host of information about future plots that\u2019s going to benefit this country and keep us safe.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "type": "article"}
