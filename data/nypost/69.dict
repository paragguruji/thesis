Those options include seeking an emergency stay at the Supreme Court, continuing the appeal with the panel, having an emergency hearing en banc, or going to the trial court at the district level and trial on the merit,\u201d Stephen Miller said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d using the legal term for a hearing before the entire federal appeals panel that decided not to reinstate the immigration ban last week.\n\nBut Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said there\u2019s one more option \u2013 toss it in the garbage.\n\n\u201cI think he ought to throw it in the trash,\u201d the New York democrat said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI think this executive order is so bad and so poisoned and its genesis is so bad and terrible that he ought to just throw it in the trash can.\u201d\n\nHe went on to call the order \u201cun-American and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cA religious ban just goes against the American brain. We believe in immigrants in this country and we don\u2019t believe in a religious test,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Miller reiterated the White House\u2019s belief that Trump has the constitutional authority to \u201calso engage in conducting border control and immigration into this country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do not have judicial supremacy in this country,\u201d Miller said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe have three co-equal branches of government.\u201d\n\nMiller also said the controversy over banning refugees from the seven countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen \u2013 is based in ideology rather than law.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional right for a citizen in a foreign country who has no status in America to demand entry into our country,\u201d Miller said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cSuch a right cannot exist, such a right will never exist.\u201d\n\nHe also defended the nationwide roundup of undocumented immigrants over the weekend by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe are going to follow the laws of the United States, and in following those laws, we will prioritize the removal of people who have criminal records in this country,\u201d Miller said on ABC.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
