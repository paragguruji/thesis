No to War\u201d and \u201cTrump: Special Relationship? Just say no.\u201d at the demonstration against the ban and Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nTrump signed an order just over a week ago putting a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the U.S. and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOn Friday, a Seattle judge blocked the order but many in Britain are angry about the measure, which they see as discriminatory, and the time it took for Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government to criticize it.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "type": "article"}
