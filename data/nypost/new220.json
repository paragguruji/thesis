President Trump\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang wrote.\n\nTrump, who said the order was necessary to protect the US from terror attacks, removed a preference for religious minorities from the updated version he signed on March 6 with the intent to make it legally bulletproof.\n\n\u201cDespite these changes, the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang said.\n\nHis decision comes a day after US District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii wrote that \u201ca reasonable, objective observer \u2026 would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.\u201d\n\nThe president revised his original travel ban after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a restraining order issued by a federal judge in Washington state.\n\nThe new executive order, signed on March 6, removed Iraq from the list of seven mostly Muslim countries where immigration was restricted. It would have gone into effect on Thursday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said the Trump administration will appeal the rulings, and the Department of Justice is working out the legal strategy and timing.\n\nSpicer, during the daily press briefing on Thursday, said the president has full authority to suspend immigration in the interests of protecting the country.\n\n\u201cThe danger is real and the law is clear, the president was elected to change our broken immigration system and he will continue to exercise his Constitutional authority and presidential responsibility to protect our nation,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department called out the \u201cflawed\u201d ruling.\n\nThe executive order \u201cfalls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our Nation\u2019s security, and the Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the court,\u201d Sarah Isgur Flores wrote in a statement.", "authors": ["March"], "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "case", "revised", "ban", "immigration", "judge", "president", "trumps", "issued", "federal", "order", "halts", "muslim", "chuang"], "summary": "Two federal judges have frozen President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban that limits immigration from six mainly Muslim countries, with both agreeing that the executive order discriminates against religion.\nPresident Trump\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang wrote.\n\u201cDespite these changes, the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang said.\nThe new executive order, signed on March 6, removed Iraq from the list of seven mostly Muslim countries where immigration was restricted.\nThe executive order \u201cfalls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our Nation\u2019s security, and the Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the court,\u201d Sarah Isgur Flores wrote in a statement."}
