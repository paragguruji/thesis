Then in June, Emirates\u2019 twice-daily Seattle and Boston routes will go down to once a day, followed by similar cuts to the Los Angeles service starting in July.\n\nTrump\u2019s visa cancellations were reversed by a federal court in February \u2014 then again in March \u2014 but the administration in June barred passengers on 13 airlines from flying out of the Middle East with laptops, iPads, cameras and other large gadgets in their carry-on luggage to New York, Chicago and Detroit.\n\nThe company said it hopes to reinstate service to the affected route if business picks up.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-04-19", "type": "article"}
