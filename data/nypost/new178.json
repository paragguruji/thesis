(That\u2019s why Team Trump hasn\u2019t issued the new rules, though it\u2019s more than 120 days since it issued the temporary bans: An appeals court only junked that part of the initial injunction recently.)\n\nSo why are the Supremes forcing Trump to admit folks with ties to people already here? Part of it is that the ruling addressed only the lower courts\u2019 injunctions \u2014 and so paid extra heed to possible \u201chardships\u201d for US citizens, etc., who\u2019d host the travelers.\n\nYet, since \u201cpreserving national security is \u2018an urgent objective,\u2019 \u201d the court said, blocking the ban against people with no ties to America would \u201cinjure\u201d US interests \u201cwithout alleviating\u201d hardship to any Americans.\n\nThat said, judges typically strike down injunctions only when they think it highly likely they\u2019ll rule that way after a full hearing and argument, which strongly suggests Trump will see a full triumph later this year.\n\nTechnically, the case could become moot \u2014 because the administration should finish its review and issue final rules before the high court hears the actual case in October.\n\nBut that will only trigger fresh litigation that will still wind up with the Supremes \u2014 since the left won\u2019t let Trump do anything.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "June"], "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "rulings", "courts", "trump", "supremes", "ban", "supreme", "days", "win", "rules", "court", "rule", "ties", "law"], "summary": "The Supreme Court handed a big victory to President Trump and the rule of law Monday, unanimously striking down over-the-top rulings against his travel ban by two US courts of appeals.\nThe leaps of imagination got so extreme that one Hawaii judge had actually stopped the administration\u2019s review of vetting procedures.\nSo why are the Supremes forcing Trump to admit folks with ties to people already here?\nTechnically, the case could become moot \u2014 because the administration should finish its review and issue final rules before the high court hears the actual case in October.\nBut that will only trigger fresh litigation that will still wind up with the Supremes \u2014 since the left won\u2019t let Trump do anything."}
