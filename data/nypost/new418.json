Uber not only continued to send its drivers, it turned off its surge pricing in an attempt to drum up more business.\n\nThe move didn\u2019t sit well with riders \u2014 and while Lyft also remained operational during the period, numbers showed that many were turning to the second-tier livery service as a result.\n\nAccording to App Annie, Lyft saw more daily downloads on iOS than Uber on Sunday \u2014 jumping from a ranking of #39 in the free apps charts to #4 by 4 p.m. Monday, TechCrunch reports.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco-based analytics firm told the Verge that Lyft managed to more than double its daily average from the previous two weeks. On Monday, they were sitting ahead of Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube and Facebook on the free apps list.\n\nsee also Anti-Trump protesters are refusing to use Uber Disgusted Uber customers are deleting the ride-sharing app in droves...\n\nSince its inception, Lyft has marketed itself as a friendlier, more casual alternative to Uber.\n\nThe company tried to take this stance yet again Sunday, by pledging to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as the #DeleteUber campaign continued to gain traction.\n\n\u201cBanning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the U.S. is antithetical to both Lyft\u2019s and our nation\u2019s core values,\u201d Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green said in a joint statement. \u201cWe stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community.\n\nWhile Uber did later announce that they also would be providing three months of compensation to drivers who may be stranded overseas due to Trump\u2019s travel ban, their decision to not join in on the protest at JFK was apparently too much to bear.\n\nThousands joined in on the #DeleteUber campaign throughout the weekend, including celebrities from all walks of entertainment.\n\n\u201cGoodbye @Uber. Hello @lyft.\u201d Susan Sarandon tweeted Monday.\n\n\u201cDELETING @UBER RIGHT THE F\u2013K NOW!!!\u201d wrote Taraji P. Henson, star of Empire.\n\n\u201cIf you support HATE YO ASS GETS DELETED #BYEB\u2014H,\u201d she added.\n\nThe fact that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is set to serve as an economic adviser to President Trump hasn\u2019t been helping matters, either.\n\n\u201cWe must be mindful of where we spend our $ & the people we\u2019re making rich [sic],\u201d tweeted comedian Billy Eichner. \u201cI\u2019ve used @UBER constantly & loved it.
