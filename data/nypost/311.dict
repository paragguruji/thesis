Now the higher court\u2019s denial of an immediate stay means the legal battles will continue for days at least.\n\nActing Solicitor General Noel Francisco forcefully argued Saturday night that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States \u2014 an assertion that invokes the wider battle to come over illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThe power to expel or exclude aliens is a fundamental sovereign attribute, delegated by Congress to the executive branch of government and largely immune from judicial control,\u201d the brief says.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the government officially suspended the ban\u2019s enforcement in compliance with order of the order of U.S. District Judge James Robart. It marks an extraordinary setback for the new president, who only a week ago acted to suspend America\u2019s refugee program and halt immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries the government said raise terrorism concerns.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, mocked Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, calling him a \u201cso-called judge\u201d whose \u201cridiculous\u201d ruling \u201cwill be overturned.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTrump\u2019s direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against the federal judge of Mexican heritage who oversaw lawsuits alleging fraud by Trump University, and may prompt some tough questions as these challenges rise through the courts.\n\nBut the government\u2019s brief repeatedly asserts that presidential authority cannot be questioned by judges once the nation\u2019s security is invoked.\n\nCongress \u201cvests complete discretion in the President\u201d to impose conditions on alien entry, so Trump isn\u2019t legally required to justify such decisions, it says. His executive order said the ban is necessary for \u201cprotecting against terrorism,\u201d and that \u201cis sufficient to end the matter.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department asked that the federal judge\u2019s order be stayed pending resolution of the appeal, so that the ban can \u201censure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\u201d\n\nsee also Judge's blocking of travel ban sets stage for epic court battle A federal judge in Seattle Friday struck down a week-old...\n\nThe order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompted protests across the United States and led to multiple court challenges. Demonstrations took place outside the White House, in New York and near his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump was attending the annual American Red Cross fundraising gala.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll win,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday night. \u201cFor the safety of the country, we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe State Department, after initially saying that as many as 60,000 foreigners from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen had their visas canceled, reversed course on Saturday and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa.\n\nThe department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order will now be allowed in. A State Department official said in an email obtained by The Associated Press that the government was \u201cfocusing on booking refugee travel\u201d through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump\u2019s order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \u201csuspended any and all actions\u201d related to putting in place Trump\u2019s order.\n\nHearings have also been held in court challenges nationwide. Washington state and Minnesota argued that the temporary ban and the global suspension of the U.S. refugee program harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination.\n\nIn his written order Friday, Robart said it\u2019s not the court\u2019s job to \u201ccreate policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\u201d but rather, to make sure that an action taken by the government \u201ccomports with our country\u2019s laws.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department countered that \u201cjudicial second-guessing of the President\u2019s national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large.\u201d\n\nRobart\u2019s order also imposes harm on U.S. citizens \u201cby thwarting the legal effect of the public\u2019s chosen representative,\u201d it says.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "type": "article"}
