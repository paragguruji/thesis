It is entirely appropriate that the political branches have their own view of the law and the Constitution and robustly contest \u2014 and even deny the legitimacy of \u2014 court decisions that they consider erroneous.\n\nTrump will have to go considerably further to come close to Andrew Jackson supposedly saying of a Supreme Court decision protecting the Cherokee Indians in Georgia, \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\u201d Or to match the wars waged on uncongenial Supreme Court decisions by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of Robart, who blocked Trump\u2019s travel ban, as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d was needlessly insulting and counterproductive. That said, Trump is fully within his rights, indeed it should be his responsibility, to defend the legal and constitutional prerogatives of the presidency as he sees them.\n\nLincoln quoted Andrew Jackson for what should be the unassailable proposition that, \u201cEach public officer, who takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.\u201d\n\nIn a notorious fireside chat in 1937, FDR described the American government as a three-horse team, pulled by Congress, the executive and the courts. Guess who was falling down on the job by striking down New Deal legislation? \u201cTwo of the horses are pulling in unison today; the third is not.\u201d FDR proposed his court-packing scheme as the remedy (to get \u201cnew and younger blood\u201d on the court, you understand).\n\nIf FDR\u2019s court gambit is a blot on his record, Lincoln\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott decision redounds to his great credit.\n\nTo say that Republicans weren\u2019t deferential to the ruling is an understatement for the ages. They alleged a vast conspiracy of Chief Justice Roger Taney and top Democrats to commit offenses \u201ccomparable to the worst villainies of recorded history,\u201d in the words of one historian.\n\nEveryone would soon enough recognize Dred Scott as a disgrace. At the time, though, supporters of the decision considered it a means to peacefully settle a question tearing the country apart.\n\nLincoln allowed that Dred Scott applied to the particular parties to the case; he refused, though, to accept it \u201cas a political rule.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Lincoln venting during an idle moment in his bathrobe. As Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, has written, \u201cLincoln\u2019s answer to the problem of judicial authority was a hesitant, at first moderate, at times inconsistent, but increasingly radical and complete repudiation of the idea of judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation.\u201d\n\nLincoln devoted a portion of his first inaugural to developing his argument. \u201cIf the policy of the government upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, \u201cthe people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\u201d Lincoln and the wartime Republican Congress proceeded to govern as if the Dred Scott decision didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd disconnect that Lincoln is justly considered perhaps the greatest statesman in the history of our country, yet his rejection of judicial supremacy that was so central to his view of our system is roundly ignored \u2014 as it is by Democrats who\u2019ve made opposition to Citizen\u2019s United a long-term cause.\n\nThe fundamental point is that it is not just the executive or Congress that can abuse its power and overstep its bounds. The courts can, too, and no one is obligated to meekly accept their decisions.\n\nThursday, a 9th Circuit panel upheld the temporary stay of Trump\u2019s travel ban. If the courts in the end throw out the order, despite the black-and-white letter of the law giving him the authority to block aliens in the interest of national security, it will be a usurpatory act.\n\nIn that scenario, the courts will have done more violence to our constitutional system than a foolish Trump tweet ever could.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["slamming", "courts", "trump", "supremes", "lincoln", "abe", "supreme", "judge", "court", "fdr", "dred", "view", "decision", "scott"], "summary": "Trump\u2019s slam of Judge James Robart was undeniably crude and ill-considered, but it wasn\u2019t a threat to our republic.\nIf FDR\u2019s court gambit is a blot on his record, Lincoln\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott decision redounds to his great credit.\nEveryone would soon enough recognize Dred Scott as a disgrace.\nLincoln allowed that Dred Scott applied to the particular parties to the case; he refused, though, to accept it \u201cas a political rule.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t Lincoln venting during an idle moment in his bathrobe.\nIn that scenario, the courts will have done more violence to our constitutional system than a foolish Trump tweet ever could."}
