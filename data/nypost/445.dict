But it will be case by case,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nMayor de Blasio has said New York would not change its policy regarding offering undocumented immigrants sanctuary despite Trump\u2019s threat to withhold some funding from sanctuary cities.\n\nDe Blasio said last month about $150 million was at stake, most of it for antiterror policing.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order on Jan. 25 protected police from funding cuts, so it\u2019s unclear to which grants Kelly was referring.\n\nKelly also toned down some of Trump\u2019s recent promises on curbing illegal immigration, answering questions about the president\u2019s travel ban, the Mexican border wall and plan to add thousands of new border patrol agents.\n\nKelly said he did not expect to meet Trump\u2019s hiring goals of 5,000 additional US Customs and Border Protection agents and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents within two years.\n\nAnd he admitted that the border wall may include fencing and may not cover the whole border, and that he expected construction along parts of the border to be \u201cwell under way\u201d within two years.\n\nsee also De Blasio says 'sanctuary city' funding keeps NYC safe Mayor de Blasio on Thursday morning doubled down on his...\n\nBut Kelly never wavered in defending Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying it made \u201can awful lot of sense.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers who have argued that the travel ban is inhumane, counterproductive and essentially a Muslim ban assailed Kelly over the issue.\n\nBut Kelly denied that allegation and referred to the order as a \u201cpause\u201d that would give the United States time to fully evaluate how would-be visitors and refugees are being vetted before being allowed into the country.\n\nIn a tweet this week, Trump said, \u201cMany very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.\u201d\n\nPressed by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) to address the claim, Kelly said the government won\u2019t know for sure if someone with evil intentions entered the US \u201cuntil the boom,\u201d referring to a possible attack.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "type": "article"}
