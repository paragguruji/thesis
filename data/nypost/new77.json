But it also raises a key question: What happens after the bans expire?\n\nAlas, it\u2019s far from clear the White House has made much (if any) progress crafting a permanent policy for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of refugees and immigrants from risky nations. And it\u2019s been 38 days since the first order was issued (42 percent of the way through the original 90-day period).\n\nWhen The Post asked the White House about progress Monday, a spokesman said only, \u201cWhen we have an announcement to make on that front, we will let you know.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not terribly reassuring. Remember, the order isn\u2019t supposed to be an end in itself but only a way to provide time to improve the vetting process.\n\nTrue, under the new order, Homeland Security will have 20 days to do a \u201ccountry-by-country review of the identity and security information that each country provides\u201d in support of visa and applications. Those found lacking get another 50 days to improve the quality of their data.\n\nThe new order also addresses legal challenges that derailed the initial bans: It phases in over two weeks instead of taking effect immediately and won\u2019t affect green-card holders or those with valid visas as of Jan. 27. And it removes Iraq from the list of affected countries after officials said they\u2019re satisfied with Baghdad\u2019s screening.\n\nStill, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says, the point is to permanently eliminate \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that terrorists can exploit.\n\nLet\u2019s hope Trump & Co. are working on a plan for that.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "March"], "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "days", "vetting", "security", "point", "order", "trumps", "progress", "bans", "white", "critical", "comes", "way"], "summary": "President Trump\u2019s revisions to his travel and immigration bans didn\u2019t stop Democrats from ripping them just as fiercely as they did the earlier ones.\nYet all the arguing misses a key point: Trump\u2019s restrictions are temporary: The bans last 90 days for travelers from six specific countries, and 120 days for refugees.\nBut it also raises a key question: What happens after the bans expire?\nAnd it\u2019s been 38 days since the first order was issued (42 percent of the way through the original 90-day period).\nStill, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says, the point is to permanently eliminate \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that terrorists can exploit."}
