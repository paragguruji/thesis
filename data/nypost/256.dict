After her speech, some suggested she run for mayor, but not all the reviews were positive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise the Speaker\u2019s final State of the City address continued to push a liberal agenda that she set forth on day one.\u201d said the Council\u2019s Republican Minority Leader Steven Matteo. \u201cI have made it very clear that I disagree with it, and believe it is the wrong path forward for our city.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
