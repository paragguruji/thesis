Andrew Cuomo on Friday, comparing his inability to fulfill a decade-old court order on school funding to President Trump\u2019s court fight over his refugee and immigration ban.\n\n\u201cWe are still fighting for fairness. We are still fighting for a court decision to be implemented,\u201d said de Blasio on his weekly WNYC radio show, referring to the state Court of Appeals ruling in 2006 that found lawmakers had to spend billions more dollars to ensure all students get an equally good education.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in some of the budget documents we saw this year from the governor\u2019s office, there was an effort to no longer honor the wording that\u2019s related to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. That\u2019s a step in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThe mayor then added, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting day because we are talking about the president trying to defy a court order.\u201d\n\nWhen told by host Brian Lehrer that Trump was actually planning to fight the ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco blocking the temporary travel ban \u2014 but not defying it \u2014 Hizzoner clarified his statement.\n\n\u201cFirst, it appeared to be open defiance, and then it turned into verbally defiant attitude. But the point I am trying to make is, I think there are people all over this state, all over this country, saying, \u2018Wait a minute! You don\u2019t get to make up the rules,'\u201d de Blasio said.\n\n\u201cNo president, no one, gets to make up the rules. When the highest court rules, that\u2019s it. I am saying something to you that is astounding \u2026 A decade ago, the highest court in New York state ruled [on the Campaign for Fiscal Equity case] \u2014 everyone saw it \u2014 \u2026 [but] it\u2019s been treated as part of a lost civilization now rather than something that happened a decade ago and was black and white.\u201d\n\nDani Lever, a spokeswoman for Gov. Cuomo, responded:\n\n\u201cThe mayor needs to stop with the \u2018alternative facts\u2019. The truth is that the Campaign for Fiscal Equity case ended 10 years ago. The state has met the funding requirement many times over, and since the mayor took office, we have increased funding to New York City schools at a rate of 38 percent higher than the city. Speaking of court orders \u2013 we look forward to the City honoring multiple legal decisions to make police disciplinary proceedings public.\u201d", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["thats", "trump", "blasio", "state", "funds", "rules", "court", "flap", "compares", "funding", "school", "fiscal", "cuomo", "mayor", "city", "equity", "president"], "summary": "Andrew Cuomo on Friday, comparing his inability to fulfill a decade-old court order on school funding to President Trump\u2019s court fight over his refugee and immigration ban.\n\u201cUnfortunately, in some of the budget documents we saw this year from the governor\u2019s office, there was an effort to no longer honor the wording that\u2019s related to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity.\nWhen the highest court rules, that\u2019s it.\nThe truth is that the Campaign for Fiscal Equity case ended 10 years ago.\nSpeaking of court orders \u2013 we look forward to the City honoring multiple legal decisions to make police disciplinary proceedings public.\u201d"}
