Lunch and dinner will include burgers, turkey sandwiches, and chicken fajitas.\n\nDetainees may be eating well, but they may not be breaking bread with their family.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly confirmed earlier this week that he may be separating children from their parents who cross illegally from Mexico into the US.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-10", "type": "article"}
