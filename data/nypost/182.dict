They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out,\u201d Trump wrote, referring to the mainstream media.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, Trump ripped the Justice Department for offering a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of his travel ban and to call for the need for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of visitors coming into the country after Saturday\u2019s terror attack in London that killed seven people.\n\nHe also chided London Mayor Sadiq Khan for telling people there\u2019s \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d when they see a heightened police presence on the streets in the wake of the London Bridge terror rampage.\n\n\u201cPathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDuring the White House briefing on Monday, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump uses social media because it allows him to talk directly to the people.\n\n\u201cIt gives him the ability to speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those types of communications,\u201d she said. \u201cHe at this point has over 100-plus million contacts through social media and all those platforms. I think it\u2019s a very important tool for him to be able to utilize.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said people are making too much of a deal out of Trump\u2019s Twitter use and not paying enough attention to his actions as president.\n\n\u201cThis obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little what he does as president \u2026\u201d said Conway said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-06", "type": "article"}
