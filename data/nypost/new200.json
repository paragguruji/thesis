Mazie Hirono responded by trying to give Sessions a civics lesson on Twitter, saying Hawaii has been a U.S. state for 58 years.\n\nThe senator said later in a telephone interview the remarks showed a lack of awareness about the separation of powers between the judiciary and executive branches.\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson last month blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order prohibiting new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily halting the U.S. refugee program. The Trump Administration appealed the ruling.\n\nSessions told the \u201cMark Levin Show\u201d he\u2019s confident the president will prevail with his administration\u2019s appeal of Watson\u2019s travel ban ruling.\n\nsee also Federal judge extends order blocking Trump's travel ban HONOLULU \u2014 A federal judge in Hawaii decided Wednesday to...\n\n\u201cI really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nHirono also said Sessions\u2019 remarks suggested he is prejudiced against Hawaii.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t a federal judge from Hawaii as able as any other judge from anywhere to issue rulings?\u201d Hirono asked.\n\nShe told Session on Twitter \u201cwe won\u2019t succumb to your dog whistle politics.\u201d\n\nBoth Hirono and Sen.
