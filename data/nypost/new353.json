But he says that\u2019s all wrong: \u201cIf Yates truly felt this way, she should have told the president her conclusions in confidence. If he disagreed, she had one option: resign.\u201d Instead, she chose to become \u201ca political martyr and refused to comply.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a Nixon-like \u201cmassacre,\u201d he asserts \u2014 it\u2019s \u201ca textbook case of insubordination, and the president was well within his constitutional powers to fire her.\u201d And her ploy will \u201cunfortunately inhibit dissent within an already skittish agency.\u201d\n\nPolitical analyst: Team Hillary Blames Obama\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthe worst-kept secret inside Democratic circles,\u201d says Mike Allen at Axios: Hillary Clinton\u2019s team is not only \u201cbitter\u201d at Barack Obama, they blame him \u2014 \u201cmore than [Vladimir] Putin, FBI Director James Comey or, um, Hillary herself\u201d for her defeat. According to Allen, \u201cClintonites feel that if Obama had come out early and forcefully with evidence of Russian interference in the campaign, and perhaps quicker sanctions, she might be president today.\u201d But Obama\u2019s people say he \u201cwas very deliberate about not being seen as politicizing the hacks.\u201d The ex-president also \u201chas let it be known that he remains befuddled on how she missed what to him was an easy layup of a win, given his own popularity . . . and Trump\u2019s vulgarity.\u201d\n\nSecurity analyst: Is This the Bannon Administration?\n\nDuring their confirmation hearings, many of President Trump\u2019s national-security choices disagreed with his public positions. Meanwhile, notes Max Boot at Commentary, \u201cTrump was staffing the White House with hardline aides . . . who appeared much more simpatico\u201d with his stated views. And early indications suggest the two Steves \u2014 political operative Bannon and policy adviser Miller \u2014 are in control. \u201cBannon\u2019s ascendancy has been crowned by his inclusion in the high-level Principals Committee of the National Security Council,\u201d even \u201cwhile the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence have been excluded.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cominous and troubling,\u201d says Boot, given that Bannon \u201cis not a conservative but a populist rabble-rouser.\u201d Then again, \u201cTrump is so volatile and has such a proclivity for firing employees that the current status quo may not last.\u201d\n\nFrom the right: Union Leaders for Trump\n\nIt\u2019s been a good two weeks for blue-collar unions, says Steven Malanga at City Journal, with President Trump withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, reviving the Keystone and Dakota pipelines and discussing with union leaders his massive infrastructure program. And those leaders, \u201cwhose membership once constituted the core of the Democratic Party, were effusive in their praise of a president who knows their business perhaps better than anyone who\u2019s ever held the office.\u201d Another way Trump \u201ccontinues to scramble assumptions about American political allegiances,\u201d because the Democratic Party \u201cno longer resembles the one that nurtured the union movement when it was largely composed of blue-collar, private-sector workers.\u201d\n\nWonk: O\u2019Care Fix Must Focus on Avg. American\n\nOne reason ObamaCare is so unpopular is that, says Jeffrey Anderson at The Weekly Standard, it\u2019s \u201cbad for the typical \u2014 or median \u2014 American for a wide variety of reasons,\u201d including the individual mandate, its centralization of power and its handling of pre-existing conditions. But its biggest problem is \u201cthe tax inequity that gives open-ended tax breaks to millions of Americans with job-based insurance, while denying tax breaks altogether for millions of Americans who buy health insurance on their own.\u201d This \u201cprovides a huge opening\u201d for the GOP: \u201cRather that fearing a political backlash from passing an alternative, Republicans should be eager to pass a plan for which the typical American will reward them.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Compiled by Eric Fettmann", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "January"], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["trump", "bannon", "political", "sally", "comments", "union", "democratic", "obama", "hillary", "notable", "yates", "leaders", "president", "tax"], "summary": "Law prof: Why Trump Had To Fire Sally YatesDemocrats are hailing Sally Yates, a career prosecutor appointed by Barack Obama, \u201cfor standing up to a supposedly \u2018tyrannical\u2019 \u201d President Trump on his immigration order, only to be fired for doing so, notes Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor, in Politico.\nBut he says that\u2019s all wrong: \u201cIf Yates truly felt this way, she should have told the president her conclusions in confidence.\nDuring their confirmation hearings, many of President Trump\u2019s national-security choices disagreed with his public positions.\nMeanwhile, notes Max Boot at Commentary, \u201cTrump was staffing the White House with hardline aides .\nAnd early indications suggest the two Steves \u2014 political operative Bannon and policy adviser Miller \u2014 are in control."}
