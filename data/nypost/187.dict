In a 205-page opinion, it struck down President Trump\u2019s 90-day travel ban on foreign nationals from six majority Muslim countries.\n\nThe ban was squarely within the authority of the president under USC 1182(f), which provides that: \u201cWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation . . . suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s clear enough, but the court set aside the order for two reasons. First, the text had to be read in the context of Trump campaign speeches that dripped \u201cwith religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d Second, the court doubted that the order\u2019s \u201cvague words of national security\u201d were supported by evidence that the excluded foreigners posed a danger to Americans.\n\nConservative commentators pounced on the first of those grounds. The ban extended to six really dangerous Muslim countries, and not to the 44 other majority-Muslim states. The charge of bias also seemed flat-footed when made after Trump\u2019s inclusive speech about Islam in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFurther, it was improper to impugn presidential decisions on the basis of unguarded things said in the midst of a campaign. After an election, and after taking the oath of office, presidents should be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut here the court was saying it didn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s claim that the order was meant to protect Americans from foreign terrorists: The president was a liar.\n\nThat\u2019s an extraordinary assertion of judicial power, one that takes us into uncharted constitutional waters. If Trump is a liar, then everything is up for grabs. He wants to build a wall? That must reflect anti-Mexican bias, no? Recall when he said Mexicans were \u201cbringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d? Or that missile strike on Syrian bases. If a ban on refugees from Syria can be struck down for bias, what about an attack on the country itself?\n\nBy itself, that would be a judicial coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. But it\u2019s the second basis for the decision, the claim that the aliens excluded by the order didn\u2019t really pose a threat, that\u2019s more interesting.\n\nThis flies in the face of what in American constitutional law is called the political question doctrine. That\u2019s the idea that there\u2019s a border between judicial and political issues, and courts should not stray from one to the other.\n\nIn a democracy, politics should be left to the president and Congress. But that\u2019s not what the Fourth Circuit believes. And indeed, once it thought itself competent to psychoanalyze the president and determine his true motives, the court was bound to discount alternative explanations.\n\nAnd so the court did rule on whether the ban was justified, as a political matter, in a decision that\u2019s an object lesson on why courts should stay away from politics. Presidents have access to national security information denied a court, but the Fourth Circuit nevertheless relied on a news article about an unread Homeland Security report \u201cthat citizenship in any country is likely an unreliable indicator of whether a particular individual poses a terrorist threat.\u201d\n\nThen there were 10 former foreign policy officials who disagreed with the order. Big deal. There will always be 10 highly politicized former officials who\u2019ll disagree with a president \u2014 but who won\u2019t know what the president heard that morning in a presidential daily briefing.\n\nWhat happens now? Maybe nothing. After all, the ban was lifted and terrorists struck overseas and not here. We rolled the dice and got lucky. Beyond that, I never thought that the ban made political sense. It simply distracted the administration from the real work to be done \u2014 reform of the 1965 Immigration Act.\n\nOr maybe something will happen, if the Supreme Court agrees to review the case. That seldom happens unless different circuit courts are split on the issue. Here, the Fourth and Ninth Circuit both struck down the order.\n\nBut sometimes the Supreme Court will agree to review a case even where there aren\u2019t split circuit decisions. It did that in Bush v. Gore in December 2000. The court had to do so, to determine who the president really was.\n\nFor the same reason, it should agree to review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision.\n\nF.H. Buckley teaches at Scalia Law School.
