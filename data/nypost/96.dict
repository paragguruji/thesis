I can\u2019t go back,\u201d Darweesh said shortly after his release. Asked if he\u2019d be killed in Iraq, he answered: \u201cYes, yes.\u201d\n\nThe second Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was released about 7 p.m. Saturday after nearly 24 hours in custody.\n\nAlshawi was stopped on his way to be reunited with his family in Texas. Alshawi hasn\u2019t seen his family, including his now 7-year-old son, since 2014.\n\nLawyers for Darweesh and Alshawi said the men\u2019s detentions were the direct result of an order Trump signed on Friday calling for a temporary suspension of immigration and refugee resettlement from seven predominately Muslim countries.\n\nDarweesh and Alshawi had each waited more than two years for approval to come to America, according to court papers.\n\nDarweesh was an Army interpreter in Iraq \u2014 work that led some Iraqi militia groups to target him for death.\n\nAlshawi\u2019s wife and brother-in-law both worked in back office jobs with a US security contractor in Iraq. He was on his way to join his wife in the United States.\n\nWhen lawyers trying to reach Alshawi early Saturday asked US Customs agents who they could speak to about the detention, an agent allegedly replied, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nDarweesh was released just after 12:30 p.m., according to a tweet by Nadler, who was joined at the airport by Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn).\n\nThe executive order Trump issued on Friday imposes a 120-day moratorium on the refugee resettlement program and also proclaims that \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d It also calls for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of those entering the United States from certain countries, and suspends for 90 days immigration from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that when Donald Trump signed the order there was no actual plan in place for how to implement it,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrant Rights Project.\n\nThe ACLU believes other people flying to Kennedy Airport, and other airports around the country, have been detained since the executive order was signed, but Jadwat could not provide specifics.\n\nThe executive order also impacts legal permanent residents with green cards, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman told Reuters.\n\nDarweesh, a married father of three, was heading to Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife and kids Friday night when he flew from Erbil, Iraq to JFK.\n\nThe rest of his family made it through customs. But agents stopped Darweesh, and refused to let him meet with lawyers for hours, according to a Brooklyn Federal Court filing seeking his release.\n\nDarweesh spent a decade working as an interpreter, electrical engineer and contractor. He worked with the US Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division and the 91st Engineering Unit as well as federal contractors.\n\nDarweesh was \u201cdirectly targeted twice for his association with the US Armed Forces,\u201d his lawyers said.\n\nBaghdad Police, who are \u201cwidely known to be closely affiliated with anti-American militias,\u201d searched his home; and sometime after that search was conducted, two of Darweesh\u2019s colleagues \u201cwere killed as soon as they arrived to work,\u201d according to the court filing.\n\nDarweesh and his family fled from Baghdad to Kirkuk but the trouble followed in July 2009, when he was stopped at a market by a local shopkeeper who told him \u201cthat men were driving around in a BMW asking for [Darweesh] by name and the location of his house,\u201d his lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThese men returned a second time the following week, and Mr. Darweesh had strong reasons to suspect that the men searching for him were terrorist,\u201d prompting the family to flee again, this time to Erbil, according to legal papers.\n\nThe Darweesh family applied for an Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa on Oct. 1, 2014 and were approved Jan. 20. They received the visas Wednesday and boarded their flight to the US Friday.\n\nTragedy had already touched the Alshawi family when he boarded his flight from Stockholm to New York Friday.\n\nAlshawi\u2019s wife was an accountant for federal contractor Falcon Security Group from 2006 to 2007; her brother was a human resources rep for the company.\n\nRumors began swirling that, \u201cdue to the family\u2019s association with the US military, insurgents thought that they were collaborators,\u201d according to court papers.\n\nIn 2010, Alshawi\u2019s brother-in-law was nearly kidnapped; a month later, an car bomb killed some of Alshawi\u2019s in-laws, according to court papers.\n\nAlshawi\u2019s wife and young son applied for refugee status in 2011 and settled in Houston in 2014, when she sought approval for her husband to join them. He was approved on Jan. 11.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen in America. We shouldn\u2019t have to demand the release of refugees one by one,\u201d Nadler and Velazquez said in a joint statement as hundreds of people gathered at the airport to protest the detentions.\n\nDetails emerged Saturday evening of another Kennedy Airport detainee.\n\nTwo sisters, Elaf and Anfal Hussain, went to the airport in hope of getting their mother, Iman, out of detention.\n\nIman Hussain, 48, was stopped by Customs after a 17 hour trip from Baghdad to Qatar to JFK.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her for seven years and now they want to send her back,\u201d said a tearful Anfal Hussain. \u201cI\u2019m really scared right now. She has been trying for two years to get her visa. She just got it Jan. 16th. She has been vetted. I don\u2019t know what the problem is.\u201d\n\nIman Hussain told her kids to go home and told them officials had already booked her on an evening flight out of the country.\n\nWith Post Wire Services", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "type": "article"}
