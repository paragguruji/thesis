Dianne Feinstein (D-Cal.) has drafted legislation to rescind the executive order, while Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) plans to introduce legislation in the House this week to stop funding for Trump\u2019s refugee ban.\n\nBut Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) believes it will be up to judges, not lawmakers, to end the immigration ban.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the courts more than Congress that will knock this down because it\u2019s not only dangerously stupid, but it\u2019s also unconstitutional and flatly illegal,\u201d Nadler told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nSchumer also wants to delay the confirmation vote of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State until the former oil executive weighs in on Trump\u2019s immigration ban.\n\nA procedural vote to advance Tillerson\u2019s nomination was scheduled for Monday night in the Senate.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said no one has yet to see the \u201cphantom bill\u201d to undo the travel ban. It would require \u201cunanimous consent\u201d of the Senate, not just McConnell approval, to throw a bill on the floor for a vote and bypass the committee process.\n\nSchumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will also hold a 6 p.m. rally tonight at the Supreme Court with refugees to protest the ban.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
