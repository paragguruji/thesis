But Mexican President Pena Nieto went on television last week to say the country would not pay for it and canceled a scheduled meeting with Trump.\n\nAt the weekend meeting, Charles Koch, without mentioning Trump by name, said the nation is at a point of \u201ctremendous danger,\u201d adding that America can \u201cgo the authoritarian route \u2026 or we can move toward a free and open society.
