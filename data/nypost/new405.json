Perhaps some of these people should be detained further.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologize for nothing here,\u201d he added.\n\nOn CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Priebus added the White House may \u201cexpand\u201d the travel ban beyond seven countries, if needed.\n\nCivil rights activists said over the weekend that legal permanent residents were targeted and detained at the first day of the executive order.\n\nTrita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council, said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cPolitics Nation\u201d that green card holders were detained at airports, handcuffed, their social media accounts reviewed, interrogated and \u201calso asked their view on Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is pretty scary,\u201d Parsi said.\n\nDems pledged to \u201cbattle\u201d the ban legislatively and with public pressure.\n\n\u201cWe think this administration poses a real threat to our reputation, our values and our people,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine [D-Va.] on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to battle.\u201d\n\nKaine called out the White House for issuing the ban the same day it eliminated reference to Jews from its statement Friday on Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\n\u201cThe irony is not lost on me that it was issued the same day as the White House issued their Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation that unlike any previous administration removed all reference to Jews,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cSo you put a religious test on Muslims and you try to scrub reference to Jews in the Holocaust Remembrance. This was horribly, horribly mishandled\u2026. This is what Holocaust denial is.\u201d\n\nPriebus said he doesn\u2019t regret the statement, but meant no ill-will.\n\nThe White House, he said, \u201ccertainly will never forget the Jewish people that suffered in World War II. He added: \u201c\u2026.There was no harm or ill-will or offense intended.\u201d", "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "day", "ban", "priebus", "holders", "holocaust", "card", "subject", "countries", "green", "wont", "house", "white", "detained"], "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump Administration reversed itself Sunday on a key element of its executive travel ban from Muslim countries, saying green card holders won\u2019t be prevented from legally returning to the United States.\nAmid raucous protests at airports due to President Trump\u2019s executive order to temporarily restrict travel from seven Muslim countries, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said legal residents won\u2019t be subject to the ban.\nOn CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Priebus added the White House may \u201cexpand\u201d the travel ban beyond seven countries, if needed.\nCivil rights activists said over the weekend that legal permanent residents were targeted and detained at the first day of the executive order.\nThe White House, he said, \u201ccertainly will never forget the Jewish people that suffered in World War II."}
