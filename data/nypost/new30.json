Am I right?\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that the government did not argue that the detainees posed any risk.\n\nGelernt said the feds had not given up the names of all the people who were detained around the country.\n\nStill, he insisted the detainees posed no risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if these people weren\u2019t vetted, they were just caught in transit,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThey were in a horrible position.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear how the feds would respond to the decision by Donnelly, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama.\n\nDonnelly first made news as a former Manhattan assistant district attorney in such high-profile cases as the successful prosecution of thieving former Tyco International Dennis Kozlowski.\n\n\u201cAnn Donnelly was a smart, tough, fair prosecutor,\u201d said defense lawyer and former prosecutor\u2019s office colleague Daniel Bibb.\n\n\u201cShe had that same reputation as a state Supreme Court justice, and that reputation earned her her place on the district court bench,\u201d he said.\n\nThe refugees will not be deported immediately, but may find themselves in government detention for several weeks at least.\n\nFurther proceedings are set for next month.\n\nA crowd of at least 1,000 gathered outside the courthouse erupted in cheers when Donnelly\u2019s ruling was announced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled \u2014 it just feels like every day there is another horrible thing; it\u2019s constant,\u201d said protester Jennifer Palumbo, 34, of Brooklyn Heights.\n\nTrump, she said, \u201cis impulsive. I want to say he doesn\u2019t think about the consequences of what he does as president, but I honestly think he just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nProtesters cheered as the ACLU lawyers left.\n\nTwo of the JFK detainees \u2014 both of whom had links to US forces in Iraq and were in danger of being killed if they were sent back \u2014 had already been sprung before the emergency hearing.\n\nThey were Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi.\n\nWhen their lawyers asked an airport customs supervisor for help, they were told, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u2019\u2019 they complained in court papers.\n\nThe detentions had been part of Trump\u2019s effort to keep refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen out of the country.\n\nGoing forward, travelers from those seven countries likely willstill be barred from boarding US-bound flights.\n\nTrump\u2019s ban stays in effect for 120 days.\n\nIn Philadelphia, two Syrian families living in Qatar were detained when they arrived and then sent back, relatives told NBC News.\n\nMore than a dozen were detained in Chicago.\n\nFifty people were detained at the Dallas-Forth Worth Airport.\n\nBy midafternoon, nine remained. It\u2019s unclear what happened to the 41 others.\n\nAmong those detained in Dallas were a Syrian couple visiting their sons, one of whom attends Southern Methodist University.\n\nTrump\u2019s order sowed confusion around the world as authorities rushed to comply.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Jadwat said that when Trump signed the order, \u201cthere was no actual plan in place for how to implement it.\u201d\n\nThe president strongly disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It\u2019s working very nicely.\u201d\n\nAnother JFK detainee may be Stony Brook University student Vahideh Rasekhi, according to friends who posted on social media.\n\nThe linguistics graduate student had recently made her first trip home to Iran in five years and tried to re-enter the country Friday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been living here probably more than the total amount of time she\u2019s been living in Iran,\u201d said her friend, Aida Nikou.\n\n\u201cHer not being able to come back is just so bizarre.\u201d\n\nRelatives of detainees, desperate for information, gathered throughout the day at JFK.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her for seven years, and now they want to send her back,\u201d said Elaf Hussain, of her mom, Iman, who had arrived from Iraq after a 17-hour trip.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really scared right now. She has been trying for two years to get her visa, and she just got it on Jan. 16.\n\n\u201cShe has been vetted,\u201d Hussain told The Post as she waited for word outside a JFK terminal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the problem is.\u201d\n\nReps. Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan) and Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) joined the protest at the airport.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen in America. We shouldn\u2019t have to demand the release of refugees one by one,\u201d Nadler and Velazquez said in a joint statement.\n\nGovernment officials for weeks had planned the implementation of the order, one source said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Halper, Nick Fugallo and Leonica Valentine", "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["stay", "seven", "travel", "sent", "trump", "grants", "ban", "told", "judge", "refugees", "trumps", "detainees", "federal", "order", "president", "detained", "jfk"], "summary": "A Brooklyn federal judge took on President Trump Saturday night, staying deportations that could have immediately sent people from seven predominately Muslim countries back to where they came from.\nAn estimated 100 to 200 people had been detained at airports around the country when their planes landed Friday and Saturday.\nJudge Ann Donnelly\u2019s order applies to all of them, not only to those arriving within her immediate jurisdiction at JFK Airport.\nGelernt said the feds had not given up the names of all the people who were detained around the country.\nIn Philadelphia, two Syrian families living in Qatar were detained when they arrived and then sent back, relatives told NBC News."}
