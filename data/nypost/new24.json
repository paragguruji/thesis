The courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s tweetstorm came on the heels of the terror attack in London that left seven people dead and wounded 48 others. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe White House had rejected the characterization of Trump\u2019s original executive order as a travel ban, describing it instead as a vetting system to keep America safe.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslim immigration to the US.\n\nLast week, his administration asked the Supreme Court to allow the ban \u2014 which temporarily bars nationals from six mostly Muslim countries \u2014 after lower courts rejected his national security justifications for the ban because it showed anti-Muslim prejudice.\n\nThe revised order removed Iraq from the list of banned countries, and an indefinite halt to entry from Syrian refugees was replaced by a temporary pause.\n\nA date for the court to hear arguments in the case was not immediately set.\n\nTrump\u2019s Monday missives came a day after he said he would do whatever was necessary to protect the US from a \u201cvile enemy\u201d that he said has targeted innocents for too long.\n\n\u201cThis bloodshed must end, this bloodshed will end,\u201d he vowed.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump slammed London Mayor Sadiq Khan for telling Londoners that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to be alarmed\u201d after the terror attack \u2014 though Khan was referring to an increased police presence.\n\n\u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s spokesman said he was too busy to respond to Trump\u2019s \u201cill-informed\u201d tweet.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\nAfter more than 20 people were killed in a bombing last month in Manchester, Trump condemned the assault as the act of \u201cevil losers\u201d and called on nations to unite in the fight against terrorism.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores last week said the department had \u201casked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and [is] confident that President Trump\u2019s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism,\u201d the statement said, \u201cuntil he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States.\u201d\n\nWith Post wires", "authors": ["June"], "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["travel", "politically", "trump", "scolds", "correct", "supreme", "sending", "ban", "courts", "court", "version", "doj", "need", "order", "department"], "summary": "President Trump on Monday described his executive order on immigration as a \u201ctravel ban\u201d \u2014 lashing out at his Justice Department for submitting a \u201cwatered down\u201d version to the Supreme Court.\nIn a series of early morning tweets, Trump railed against the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d version and urged the department to seek an \u201cexpedited hearing\u201d by the high court.\nshould have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\u201d Trump said.\nshould ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2013 & seek much tougher version!\u201d he continued.\nThe White House had rejected the characterization of Trump\u2019s original executive order as a travel ban, describing it instead as a vetting system to keep America safe."}
