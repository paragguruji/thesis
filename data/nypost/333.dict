Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote a letter to then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and Kerry, asking that they be briefed on \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the agreement.\u201d\n\nOnly refugees who have undergone a rigorous vetting process \u2014 including two interviews with US officials \u2014 would be allowed to enter the US under the terms of the agreement, according to Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper.\n\nWhile Australia accepted 13,756 refugees between 2014 and 2015, the country has cracked down on smugglers who illegally ferry asylum seekers to the nation by boat.\n\nsee also McCain does damage control after Trump's call with Australian PM Sen.
