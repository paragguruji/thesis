The rollout was perfect.\u201c\n\nThe appeals court upheld a restraining order issued by a Seattle judge, ruling that the government did not introduce enough evidence to show that Trump\u2019s temporary refugee and travel ban was needed so quickly.\n\nThe Justice Department has appealed that ruling.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime we\u2019re vetting very, very strongly, very, very strongly. But we need help and we need help by getting that executive order passed,\u201d the president said.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "type": "article"}
