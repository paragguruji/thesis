And Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together, at home and around the world. We have fought and died together,\u201d said Trudeau, a staunch liberal whose nation has taken in 40,000 Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cBut there have been times where we have differed in our approaches,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. Our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians\u2019 approach and be a positive example in the world.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s plan to temporarily ban all refugees as well as immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations remains tied up in federal courts.\n\nTrudeau has panned the ban and welcomed refugees fleeing Syria\u2019s devastating civil war.\n\nTrump defended the ban, declaring that he was fulfilling a campaign promise while boasting again about the size of his victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large Electoral College vote,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cAnd I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members. We are getting them out,\u201d he added, referring to the arrest in recent days of more than 680 illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump reassured Trudeau over NAFTA, which Trump repeatedly ripped on the campaign trail, saying his focus was primarily on Mexico. The trade agreement is crucial for Canada, since more than 75 percent of its exports come to the United States, while only 18 percent of American exports go north of the border.\n\n\u201cWe have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be tweaking it. We will be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, the pair noted that more than $2 billion in trade crossed the border every day. Both leaders also pledged to invest in infrastructure and cooperate on energy development.\n\n\u201cAs the process continues for the Keystone XL pipeline, we remain committed to moving forward on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also mentioned the importance of beefing up border security and said the two nations will step up efforts to stop opioid trafficking.\n\nThe leaders also agreed to boost efforts to strengthen the roles of women in the business community.\n\n\u201cAs part of this effort, we are creating a United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders,\u201d read the statement, which was issued after a White House meeting with female executives, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka.", "authors": ["February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-14", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["host", "women", "trump", "manage", "trade", "issues", "ban", "statement", "united", "trudeau", "leaders", "white", "ground", "canadians", "common"], "summary": "Despite their striking differences on immigration policy, President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found common ground Monday on a broad range of issues, from trade to creating more opportunities for women in business.\nAt a joint press conference after their meeting at the White House, Trudeau took the high road when asked about Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban.\nWe have fought and died together,\u201d said Trudeau, a staunch liberal whose nation has taken in 40,000 Syrian refugees.\nTrump defended the ban, declaring that he was fulfilling a campaign promise while boasting again about the size of his victory.\nTrump reassured Trudeau over NAFTA, which Trump repeatedly ripped on the campaign trail, saying his focus was primarily on Mexico."}
