This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!\u201d Trump tweeted early in the day.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer also called Trump\u2019s move \u201ccommon-sense steps to make sure we\u2019re never looking at the rear-view mirror asking, \u2018We should have done something.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put the safety of Americans first,\u201d Spicer said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait until we get attacked and figure out how it\u2019s going to happen again. That\u2019s the key point in this: How do we keep ahead of threats.\u201d\n\nHis comments came hours before a memo revealed that Acting Attorney General Sally Yates \u2014 a holdover from the administration of former President Barack Obama \u2014 told the Department of Justice she wasn\u2019t sure about the legality of Trump\u2019s action.\n\nYates issued a directive to not defend the order against several pending suits, including one that led a Brooklyn federal judge to bar the deportation of anyone affected by it.\n\nBut soon after she announced her position, the White House fired her and replaced her with Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\n\u201cSally Yates has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,\u201d the White House said in a press release. \u201cMs. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe order will likely get full legal support soon, as Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), faces a confirmation vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, with a vote by the full Senate to follow.\n\nsee also Sean Spicer defends Trump's immigration ban President Trump signed the executive order to restrict immigration from...\n\nDuring his White House briefing, Spicer rejected suggestions that intelligence about an impending attack led Trump to sign the Friday order barring travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days, with Syrian refugees banned indefinitely.\n\nSpicer said the US wasn\u2019t facing a \u201cspecific threat,\u201d but added that you \u201cnever know when the threat will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why the majority of Americans agree with the president. \u2026 His view is not to wait to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nSpicer also took aim squarely at dozens of State Department officials who reportedly were planning to sign a diplomatic \u201cDissent Channel\u201d memo opposing Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cThey can get with the program or they can go,\u201d Spicer said.\n\nA draft copy of the \u201csensitive but unclassified\u201d document, obtained by the Washington Post, says Trump\u2019s action \u201cwill not achieve its aim of making our country safer\u201d and \u201cruns counter to core American values of nondiscrimination, fair play and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants.\u201d\n\nLater Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) failed in a bid to force a vote on legislation by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would have overturned Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nsee also Senate Republicans block attempt to overturn Trump's immigration ban Senate Republicans have blocked a Democratic effort to overturn President...\n\nSchumer urged his colleagues to \u201crepeal the order and then sit down and discuss a smart, thoughtful, effective way to counter terrorism.\u201d\n\nBut debate over the bill was blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who said Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u201ccreated all these refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a Muslim ban,\u201d Cotton said.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a temporary pause for three to four months to evaluate whether Obama Administration policies are strong enough to keep this country safe.\u201d\n\nSchumer also unsuccessfully sought to delay a decision on the nomination of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with the Senate voting 56-43 to open debate.\n\nA confirmation vote could take place Wednesday.\n\nFollowing the defeats, Schumer joined House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), other Democratic lawmakers and refugees at an anti-Trump protest outside the US Supreme Court.\n\nAlso Monday, the Pentagon said it would help seek exemptions from Trump\u2019s travel ban for a host of Iraqis who have aided US and coalition military forces.\n\nA spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said the White House gave the Pentagon the opportunity to submit a list of names, which will include translators, drivers and Iraqi personnel who may be training in the US.\n\nDavis wouldn\u2019t say whether the Pentagon or the White House initiated the effort.\n\nIn Brooklyn, federal Judge Carol Bagley Amon was assigned to handle the suit over Trump\u2019s executive order, replacing Judge Ann Donnelly, who was working weekend duty on Saturday night when she issued the nationwide stay of deportations.\n\nDonnelly was nominated by Obama, while Amon was picked by President George H.W. Bush, but court officials said Amon was randomly assigned the hot-button case by a computer program.\n\nOther legal challenges to Trump\u2019s order include a motion for a temporary restraining order filed Monday by Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, and a federal civil rights suit filed in Virginia by plaintiffs represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
