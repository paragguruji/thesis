But we don\u2019t talk to each other, and we don\u2019t know our neighbors. We\u2019ve lost this middle ground.\n\n\u2018We asked about each other\u2019s different points of view. Even though our politics are different, we have fundamental values that align\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that. It\u2019s time to talk to one another.\u201d\n\nThe only problem? He doesn\u2019t know any conservative New Yorkers.\n\nSo Reinoso, who lives in Greenpoint, posted more than 150 flyers around Midtown and the Financial District. \u201cThose areas have high foot traffic and commuters from different [areas],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll my friends are liberal. My newsfeed is one-sided,\u201d the flyers read. \u201cAre you a conservative dealing with the same issue? If so I\u2019d like to talk . . . The first round is on me.\u201d\n\nSince then, he\u2019s received more than 100 e-mails and texts. And although some people have trolled Reinoso with essay-long messages supporting the travel ban, he has begun to make genuine connections.\n\nLast week, he met up with a middle-aged Republican man over beers in Midtown, where they talked about their views. They were both against the nomination of education secretary Betsy DeVos and the immigration ban.\n\n\u201cIt was very adult \u2014 there was no debate,\u201d Reinoso said. \u201cWe asked about each other\u2019s different points of view. Even though our politics are different, we have fundamental values that align.\u201d\n\nReinoso has another chat set up, and he hopes to meet more than 30 people in the next few months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be great to make friends out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI love encounters with strangers and being able to talk about anything. That\u2019s the New York I fell in love with.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "type": "article"}
