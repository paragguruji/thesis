Guidelines will be sent to embassies and consulates on how to implement the new proclamation. The Supreme Court had already decided under the previous travel ban people with a \u201cbonafide\u201d relationship to the United States would still be welcomed and such waivers are expected to remain in place.\n\nAnyone with a valid visa currently will not have their travel documents revoked, senior Administration officials told reporters Sunday.\n\nThis year, the Trump Administration conducted a worldwide review of immigration and travel procedures to ensure national security.
