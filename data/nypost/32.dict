A judge has blocked our executive order on travel ban \u2026 The order he blocked was a watered-down order from the first order,\u201d Trump said during a rally in Nashville, referring to his first ban, which was also blocked.\n\nTrump noted that the revised order was made to rectify problems found with the first travel ban. The amended order removed Iraq from the ban and allows in people with visas and green cards from the affected countries.\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented judicial overreach,\u201d Trump fumed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think this was done by a judge for a political reason, no? \u2026 This decision makes us look weak. We\u2019re going to fight this terrible decision all the way to the Supreme Court. We\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "type": "article"}
