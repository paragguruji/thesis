Probably, even though it doesn\u2019t exist. Explains Dena Battle in US News World Report, an Associated Press news alert claiming Trump ordered agencies\u2019 silence was picked up across the country. But \u201cthese memos, which were portrayed by the press as unprecedented control over agency communications, are actually standard procedure for whenever we have a new administration.\u201d The reason: \u201cWhen a new party comes into power, there is a lag between the Inauguration and Senate confirmation for agency heads and political appointees,\u201d during which it \u201cdoesn\u2019t really make sense for an agency to be putting out press releases, tweets and \u2018scientific\u2019 reports.\u201d The press, she says, is wasting its firepower on this.\n\nLibertarian: What To Do With Trump\u2019s Unsecured Phone\n\nSecurity experts are calling President Trump\u2019s unsecure Android phone a major risk. But, says the Cato Institute\u2019s Julian Sanchez, they\u2019re looking forwards when they should be looking back. That\u2019s because a presidential candidate\u2019s phone is a rich target long before they become president. Given the \u201claughable level of security\u201d on that Droid model, Sanchez says sophisticated attempts to break into the phone would\u2019ve succeeded. That means \u201cTrump\u2019s movements could have been tracked, any credentials stored on the phone exfiltrated, and any conversation held in the same room as the phone, recorded.\u201d Instead of destroying the phone, Trump should give it to the NSA, which \u201ccan start piecing together what the adversaries would have obtained and how they\u2019re likely to use it.\u201d\n\nInvestigative Reporter: How Abortion Hijacked Feminism\n\nThe feminist movement wasn\u2019t always so obsessed with abortion rights. Writing at The Federalist, investigative reporter (and former pro-choice feminist) Sue Ellen Browder pegs the date that changed: Nov. 18, 1967, when the National Organization of Women voted on a women\u2019s \u201cbill of rights\u201d to codify NOW\u2019s agenda. Presiding over the meeting were NOW President Betty Friedan and feminist attorney Marguerite Rawalt. The last and most controversial measure of the night was a motion to support repeal of all abortion laws. Friedan pushed for it, and \u201cwhen the dust finally settled, the vote was 57-14 in favor of a resolution calling to repeal all abortion laws,\u201d Browder recounts. The \u201cabortion \u2018right\u2019 that has created so much turmoil in our nation was inserted into the feminist movement\u2019s list of political demands by a mere 57 people.\u201d\n\nHealth-care Wonk: First, Freeze ObamaCare Enrollment\n\nThe effort to repeal ObamaCare faces a challenge, notes Philip Klein at the Washington Examiner: What to do about current beneficiaries before a replacement is ready? Repealing most of the law \u201con paper\u201d while delaying it exacerbates the problem. Instead, Klein suggests Republicans start by freezing enrollment: \u201cThey could continue allowing those who have benefits to receive them, but then prevent anybody from enrolling in the law\u2019s expanded Medicaid program who was not already on the books as of the date the bill is signed into law.\u201d It also means that \u201cnobody would be eligible for subsidies for Obamacare\u2019s exchanges who did not already sign up for coverage by Jan. 31 \u2014 the last date of open enrollment for this year.\u201d\n\nLawmaker, Think Tanker: Reverse Death With Dignity Act\n\nThe Washington, DC, City Council legalized physician-assisted suicide last year \u2014 and Congress should nullify it, implore Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and ex-Sen. Jim DeMint in The Washington Post. Congress, by law, has the power to review all legislation passed by the DC council. \u201cDuring the review of the Death With Dignity Act, Congress can and should pass a joint resolution of disapproval,\u201d they write. \u201cIf it does and the resolution is signed by the president, the misguided Death With Dignity Act would be nullified.\u201d The American Medical Association is against physician-assisted suicide, they note. And \u201cD.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt testified against the bill and identified numerous concerns with it, including the potential for abuse and coercion, particularly for individuals with disabilities.\u201d Plainly, say Chaffetz and DeMint, \u201cRather than facilitate suicides, the government\u2019s role should be to prevent them.\u201d\n\nCompiled by Seth Mandel", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "type": "article"}
