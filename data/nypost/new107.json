I just pray us as a country and a world can be united. It\u2019s very hard for me to talk about this right now. It would take a lot of time. I just want to focus on the game and talk about football.\u201d\n\nSanu\u2019s family is from Sierra Leone, which is not one of the seven restricted countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always concerned. When somebody in your family is traveling a long distance like that, you\u2019re always concerned something may go wrong. You never know,\u201d said Sanu, who went to South Brunswick (N.J.) High School and played at Rutgers. \u201cIt is what it is. You just got to hope for the best. I can\u2019t really think about that right now. I want to focus on the game and give all I can to my teammates.\u201d\n\nSanu wears a bracelet on his wrist as a tribute to Eric LeGrand, the former Rutgers player who was paralyzed in 2010 while making a tackle.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me,\u201d Sanu said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was a freshman in high school. We played against each other throughout high school. Me and Eric are really tight. I wear his \u2018Believe\u2019 bracelet ever since it happened. I\u2019ll never take it off. He\u2019s near and dear to my heart. I\u2019d do anything for that guy.\u201d", "authors": ["January"], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["bowl", "high", "travel", "seven", "mohamed", "ban", "lot", "know", "tough", "school", "rutgers", "talk", "im", "muslim", "super", "sanu"], "summary": "\u201cOf course I know \u2014 obviously my name is Mohamed \u2014 a lot of people know I\u2019m Muslim, but I\u2019m here because of my football talents, not because I\u2019m Muslim, and I\u2019m here to talk about football,\u201d the Falcons wide receiver said Monday at Super Bowl media night in Houston.\nSanu called President Donald Trump\u2019s travel restrictions from seven predominantly Muslim countries \u201ca very tough situation.\nYou never know,\u201d said Sanu, who went to South Brunswick (N.J.)
