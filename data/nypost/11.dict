But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government\u2019s compelling need to provide for the Nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nTrump said last week that the ban would take effect 72 hours after it was cleared by courts.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s appointee to the bench, along with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented in part, saying they would have put the entire ban into effect immediately.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "type": "article"}
