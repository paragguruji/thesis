It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nTrump, in a tweet storm earlier Wednesday, had lambasted the ruling by California US District Judge William Orrick, claiming lawyers for the city of San Francisco and Santa Clara County, California, had gone \u201cjudge shopping.\u201d\n\nIn February, the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had rejected Trump\u2019s bid to reinstate his travel ban after several lower courts had struck it down.\n\n\u201cOut of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the \u2018ban\u2019 case and now the \u2018sanctuary\u2019 case is brought in the 9th Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%),\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey used to call this \u2018judge shopping!\u2019 Messy system.\u201d\n\nOrrick, however, doesn\u2019t sit on the 9th Circuit. He serves on the US District Court for Northern California within the 9th Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nOn Tuesday, he issued a preliminary injunction barring any attempt to implement Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 executive order to deny federal funds to cities such as New York that don\u2019t assist federal officers searching for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe injunction will remain in place while the lawsuits wend their way through the courts.\n\nThe ACLU tweeted Wednesday night that the president \u201cabsolutely doesn\u2019t have the authority\u201d to break up the 9th Circuit.\n\nCongressional intervention would likely be necessary if the president were to attempt to redraw a federal judicial district.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-04-26", "type": "article"}
