Indeed, he observes, \u201cthe chaos that erupted in American airports . . . set the tone for how everyone processed the whole executive order.\u201d Particularly troubling: \u201cPeople at the highest levels of the federal government seemed just as confused\u201d as those trying to implement it. No one, it seems, \u201ccould figure out what the hell was going on.\u201d That\u2019s because the order apparently came from Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle,\u201d without vetting by relevant agencies. As a result, the order is \u201ca mess, with references to the wrong statutes, and legal holes the ACLU is more than happy to drive lawsuits through.\u201d\n\nForeign-policy scribe: Assad\u2019s Capitol Hill Mouthpiece\n\nSyrian strongman Bashar al-Assad scored a clear PR triumph this month when he \u201csucceeded in bringing Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) to Damascus and having her parrot [his] propaganda on her return,\u201d says Josh Rogin at The Washington Post. While \u201cthe actual source of the funding for the trip is murky,\u201d there\u2019s \u201cno doubt the Assad regime facilitated it.\u201d She and her entourage \u201creceived access to sensitive areas under the protection of government forces.\u201d On her return, she claimed the United States is arming al-Qaeda and ISIS, which matches \u201ctalking points that the Assad regime has been pushing for the entirety of the war.\u201d Warns Rogin: \u201cPrincipled opposition to US intervention in Syria is one thing. Becoming a tool of a mass murderer\u2019s propaganda and influence campaign is another.\u201d\n\nEconomist: Big Labor\u2019s Misleading Attacks on Nominee\n\nOpponents of Labor Secretary-designate Andy Puzder \u201care reading fairy tales,\u201d claiming that 60 percent of his restaurants have workplace violations, contends Diana Furchtgott-Roth at Investor\u2019s Business Daily. In fact, his company, CKE, \u201chas an exemplary record, and performs better on the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division inspections than most of its rivals.\u201d The attacks on Puzder, coming from \u201ca union-funded advocacy group,\u201d among others, \u201care politically motivated and are not grounded in fact.\u201d CKE restaurants, including Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardees, \u201care among the very best for compliance\u201d with labor laws. And, she notes, \u201cAmerican workers seek to work at these restaurants not because they are bad places to work, but precisely because they are attractive places to get a start on a career.\u201d\n\nNeocon: Removing Jews From the Holocaust\n\nJohn Podhoretz at Commentary says he regrets thinking it was just \u201cignorance and sloppiness\u201d that caused the White House to issue a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day that \u201cmade no specific mention of the Jewish people.\u201d That\u2019s because spokeswoman Hope Hicks \u201cdefended and even celebrated the White House statement,\u201d saying it shows \u201cthe inclusive approach of the Trump administration.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cabominable,\u201d says Podhoretz: \u201cThe Final Solution was aimed solely at the Jews. There is no \u2018proud\u2019 way to offer a remembrance of the Holocaust that does not reflect that simple, awful, world-historical fact.\u201d Indeed, \u201cto universalize it to \u2018all those who suffered\u2019 is to scrub the Holocaust of its meaning.\u201d\n\nConservative: Congress Can Roll Back Obama Regs\n\n\u201cUnder a process that the Senate minority cannot filibuster, Congress can easily undo any regulations that have been published in the Federal Register in the last 60 legislative days. That means anything back through June 13,\u201d reports David Freddoso in the Washington Examiner. More: It turns out, according to the Wall Street Journal, that \u201cthe 60-day time limit for Congress to roll back that rule starts either when the rule is published or Congress receives the [legally required] report on it \u2014 whichever comes later.\u201d And if no report was submitted for some of these rules, \u201cthe failure to cross T\u2019s and dot I\u2019s could be very costly for those portions of the liberal agenda that President Obama sought to advance through the regulatory process.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Compiled by Eric Fettmann", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "type": "article"}
