Last week, GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher blamed a \u201cmob\u201d of anti-Trump activists for knocking unconscious a 71-year-old female staffer at his Southern California office. A video of the incident, showing a small crowd around an opening door, was less conclusive.\n\nSeparately, OFA, which is run by ex-Obama officials and staffers, plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare\u2019s repeal.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight we can win,\u201d OFA recently told its foot soldiers. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to waver.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump insisted he\u2019s moving ahead with plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which has ballooned health insurance premiums and deductibles. \u201cObamaCare is a disaster, folks,\u201d he said, adding that activists protesting its repeal are hijacking GOP town halls and other events.\n\n\u201cThey fill up our rallies with people that you wonder how they get there,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.\u201d\n\nAs The Post reported, OFA boasts more than 250 offices nationwide and more than 32,000 organizers, with another 25,000 actively under training. Since November, it\u2019s beefed up staff and fundraising, though as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit, it does not have to reveal its donors.\n\nThese aren\u2019t typical Black Lives Matter or Occupy Wall Street marchers, but rather professionally trained organizers who go through a six-week training program similar to the training \u2014 steeped in Alinsky agitation tactics \u2014 Obama received in Chicago when he was a community organizer.\n\nChicago socialist Saul Alinsky, known by the left as \u201cthe father of community organizing,\u201d taught radicals to \u201crub raw the sores of discontent\u201d and create the conditions for a \u201crevolution.\u201d He dedicated his book, \u201cRules for Radicals,\u201d to \u201cLucifer.\u201d Michelle Obama quoted from the book when she helped launch OFA in 2013.\n\nObama appears to be behind the anti-Trump protests. He praised recent demonstrations against Trump\u2019s travel ban. And last year, after Trump\u2019s upset victory, he personally rallied OFA troops to \u201cprotect\u201d his legacy in a conference call. \u201cNow is the time for some organizing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo don\u2019t mope\u201d over the election results.\n\nHe promised OFA activists he would soon join them in the fray.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that I\u2019m going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen, but that\u2019s not so far off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see me early next year, and we\u2019re going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff.\u201d\n\nAdded the ex-president: \u201cI promise you that next year Michelle and I are going to be right there with you, and the clouds are going to start parting, and we\u2019re going to be busy. I\u2019ve got all kinds of thoughts and ideas about it, but this isn\u2019t the best time to share them.\n\n\u201cPoint is, I\u2019m still fired up and ready to go, and I hope that all of you are, as well.\u201d", "authors": ["Paul Sperry", "February"], "publish_date": "2017-02-18", "source": "nypost", "top_words": ["ofa", "training", "republican", "trump", "manual", "activists", "protesting", "obamalinked", "support", "republicans", "going", "lawmakers", "protesters"], "summary": "The manual also advises protesters to flood \u201cTrump-friendly\u201d lawmakers\u2019 Hill offices with angry phone calls and emails demanding the resignation of top White House adviser Steve Bannon.\nLast week, GOP Rep.
