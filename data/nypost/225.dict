Schneiderman on Monday joined the multi-state lawsuit against President Trump\u2019s second immigration ban.\n\nHe joined Washington state, California, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon in filing an amended complaint that lists the damage that he and the other attorneys general say will be inflicted on their states.\n\n\u201cAs our complaint details, President Trump\u2019s second executive order is just a Muslim Ban by another name, seeking to accomplish the same unlawful and unconstitutional goals of the first ban,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s continued intent to discriminate against Muslims is clear \u2014 and it undermines New York\u2019s families, institutions, and economy. I\u2019m proud to join my fellow Attorneys General as we marshal our resources to take on this latest unconstitutional executive order.\u201d\n\nNew York also filed 20 declarations from state institutions, localities, businesses and organizations\u2014 including the State University of New York, City University of New York, the Greater New York Hospital Association, tech companies such as Kickstarter, Etsy and Meetup, and individuals including scientists from Iran and Yemeni-Americans separated from their families\n\nNew York has more than 4.4 million foreign-born residents, including more than 13,000 who were born in one of the six countries named in Trump\u2019s second executive order. About 2 percent \u2014 or roughly 400,000 \u2014 of New Yorkers identify as Muslim.\n\nThe plaintiffs have filed papers in support of a continuation of the national stay upheld last month by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that it should also apply to the revised immigration ban.\n\nThe new order bars new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily shuts down America\u2019s refugee program, affecting would-be visitors and immigrants from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.\n\nTrump\u2019s original Jan. 27 order temporarily halted immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, turned away refugees, and barred some green-card holders living legally in the US from re-entering. But a federal appeals court struck down the rule on Feb. 9.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-03-13", "type": "article"}
