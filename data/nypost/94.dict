They include: Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nThe order also creates an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process for any and all immigrants and visitors to the U.S.\n\nHouse Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s a safer day for America.\u201d\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero blasted Trump\u2019s plan as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201c\u2018Extreme vetting\u2019 is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\u201d Romero said in a statement issued moments after the signing. \u201cIdentifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions.\u201d\n\nTrump defended the executive order during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cRight now, the FBI has over 1,000 [terrorism] investigations going on \u2026 and these are people that we let in,\u201d Trump said from the White House Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need this. Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\u201d\n\nTrump added that the U.S. has taken in tens of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cWe know nothing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say they vetted them. They didn\u2019t vet them, they have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don\u2019t know anything about them and they have no papers?\u201d\n\nCivil rights and refugee advocates around the world have sounded the alarm over Trump\u2019s executive order after a draft copy was leaked late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThese actions taken by Donald Trump are tantamount to a Muslim ban,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, the legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cThis is the Muslim ban that was promised by him on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nAs president, Trump has the authority to set how many refugees are allowed in annually. He can also choose to suspend the program altogether. Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush suspended refugee processing. It was later restarted.\n\nIn the last budget year, the U.S. has accepted 84,995 refugees of which 12,587 were from Syria. Former President Barack Obama set the refugee limit for the current budget year at 110,000.\n\nSources close to Trump tell Fox News he has plans to cut that by more than half to 50,000.\n\nIn an interview with CBN, Trump said persecuted Christians from Syria would get priority.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "type": "article"}
