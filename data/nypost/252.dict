Many are from Mexico as well as Arab-Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cWe have an obligation to bring humanitarian response and human response to all Brooklynites, whether or not they have correct documentation or papers,\u201d Brooklyn Community Foundation president Cecilia Clarke told The Post. \u201cThere\u2019s a very significant undocumented population. People fear their families will be divided.\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they have a right to go school? Yes. Should they get health care? Yes. What the immigration status is is not my concern.\u201d\n\nClarke said one of BCF\u2019s board members suggested creating a special immigrant rights fund just a few days after Donald Trump\u2019s election, anticipating the incoming president would follow through on his campaign pledge to curb immigration.\n\nThe foundation has $60 million in assets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a new initiative and very much a response to the new election,\u201d she said.\n\nClarke said Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration \u2014 set aside by the courts for now \u2014 set off alarm bells and has been met with \u201coverwhelming resistance across Brooklyn\u2019s communities\u201d\n\nIn its February newsletter, NY Community Trust spoke of its commitment to \u201call New Yorkers \u201d and president Lorie Slutsky urged donors to support those who feel marginalized by Trump.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a difference? We heard that question repeatedly in the past year, as campaign rhetoric heated up against environmentalists, immigrants, civil libertarians, and even those with disabilities,\u201d Slutsky said. \u201cAt The Trust, we focus on improving the quality of life for everyone who lives, works and studies here. We\u2019re resolved to make sure our city remains a beacon for all who believe in equity and respect.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly maintained that he\u2019s only cracking down on illegal immigration \u2014 particularly undocumented residents who\u2019ve committed crimes \u2014 and tightening up screening to prevent terrorists from reaching U.S. soil.", "source": "New York Post", "publish_date": "2017-02-19", "type": "article"}
