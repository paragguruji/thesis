I travel on a Swedish passport with a [work visa] that the Rangers took care of after I was traded here.\n\n\u201cAnd I actually came back into the country [Sunday] night and had no problem,\u201d said No. 93, who took an All-Star break vacation to Turks and Caicos with Henrik Lundqvist and Mats Zuccarello.\n\nZibanejad, whose team faces the Blue Jackets on Tuesday night at the Garden, has family \u2014 including his grandmother, aunts and cousins \u2014 and friends living in Iran. His mother, Ritva, is a native of Finland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun to know that it isn\u2019t easy for them to travel here and could be harder for me to see them. It\u2019s not good,\u201d Zibanejad said. \u201c[The policy] is still hard for me to grasp. It seems straightforward, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a little confusing, so as far expressing my opinion, I\u2019d like to know more about it before I say more.\u201d\n\nThe Blueshirts expect to have both Marc Staal and Jesper Fast in against the Blue Jackets, the second-place team in the Metropolitan Division who lead the fourth-place Rangers by five points while holding a game in hand.\n\nStaal, who left the lineup after \u201cnot feeling well at all\u201d following the Jan. 3 home defeat to the Sabres, is due back after missing nine games with the third recorded concussion of his NHL career. Fast missed the final four before the break with an upper body injured he sustained against Dallas on Jan. 17.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot longer than I thought, and plus the break, but I\u2019m good to go; 100 percent,\u201d said Staal, who apparently suffered symptoms in a delayed reaction to a hit/hits he took in Arizona and/or Colorado the last week of December. \u201cI feel good. I\u2019m just going to go out and play. I\u2019m not worrying about protecting myself or anything like that. If you play that way, you just put yourself in danger, anyway.\u201d\n\nAntti Raanta, sidelined since leaving the Blueshirts\u2019 5-4 loss in Montreal on Jan. 14 after suffering a first-period lower-body injury, pronounced himself good to go following Monday\u2019s practice.\n\n\u201cWhen they need me, I\u2019m ready,\u201d said Raanta, who sustained the injury on what he called, \u201ca misstep,\u201d and not as a result of the contact he absorbed when Andrew Shaw collided with the netminder in the crease 4:00 into the match.\n\nRaanta, 10-4/.923/2.23, would seem in line for the start Thursday when the Blueshirts face the Sabres in Buffalo.\n\nKevin Hayes, sidelined with a suspected left knee injury, has not skated since going down in Detroit on Jan. 22.
