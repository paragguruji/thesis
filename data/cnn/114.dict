Critics of the ban argued it was discriminatory against Muslims.\n\nThe Republican president has said the policy is critical for national security.\n\nThe case was one of several that were moving through U.S. courts on Wednesday brought by states' attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\nFor more about President Trump's travel ban, watch:\n\nTrump's first travel order signed on Jan. 27, which was more sweeping than the second revised order signed on March 6, was also halted by a federal judge.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked about the judge's order, did not comment.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "authors": "Reuters", "type": "article"}
