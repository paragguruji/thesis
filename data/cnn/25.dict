{"title": "Trump's travel ban: Companies and executives speak out", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/30/news/companies/travel-ban-executives-business-reactions/index.html", "text": "Tech executives in particular have expressed deep concern about President Trump's ban on travel by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. But leaders of companies across the economy are speaking out.\n\nImmigrants have played a big role building some major U.S. companies, particularly in tech. A 2011 report from the Partnership for a New American Economy estimates that 45% of high-tech companies in the Fortune 500 were founded by first- or second-generation Americans.\n\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford and CEO Mark Fields\n\nIn a memo to employees, they said they do not support the ban. \"Respect for all people is a core value of Ford Motor Company, and we are proud of the rich diversity of our company here at home and around the world,\" they wrote.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos\n\nBezos sent a memo to all of his employees stating, \"This executive order is one we do not support,\" and the memo listed several actions the company was taking to opposed the order.\n\n\"We're a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 years.... It's a distinctive competitive advantage for our country\u2014one we should not weaken.\"\n\nCoca-Cola Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent\n\nKent said in a statement that \"the Coca Cola (CCHGY) Company is resolute in its commitment to diversity, fairness and inclusion, and we do not support this travel ban or any policy that is contrary to our core values and beliefs.\"\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan\n\n\"As a global company, we depend upon the diverse sources of talent that our teammates represent,\" Moynihan wrote in a memo to employees. He added, \"In view of this, we are closely monitoring the recent refugee- and immigration-related executive order in the United States, and subsequent developments.\"\n\nChobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya\n\n\"This is very personal for me,\" Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN. \"As an immigrant who came to this country looking for opportunity, it's very difficult to think about and imagine what millions of people around the world must be feeling right now.\"\n\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick\n\nKalanick wrote in a Facebook post that he's committed to helping Uber drivers affected by Trump's \"unjust immigration and travel ban.\"\n\n\"Drivers who are citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen and live in the U.S. but have left the country, will not be able to return for 90 days. This means they won't be able to earn money and support their families during this period,\" Kalanick said.\n\nHe added that Uber is helping those drivers by providing 24/7 legal support, compensating drivers for lost earnings, urging the government to overturn the ban and creating a $3 million legal defense fund. Uber has also created a Google doc where drivers can fill out a form to receive assistance.\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings\n\n\"Trump's actions are hurting Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,\" Hastings said on Facebook (FB, Tech30). \"Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.\"\n\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz\n\n\"We are living in an unprecedented time,\" Schultz said in a memo to Starbucks (SBUX) employees. He pledged to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries where Starbucks does business to \"reinforce our belief in our partners around the world.\"\n\nExpedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\n\nKhosrowshahi spoke of his family's emigration to the United States after the Iranian Revolution in 1978, and the sense of relief that \"we were welcome now, and we would be welcome tomorrow.\"\n\nHe wrote to Expedia employees: \"I believe that with this Executive Order, our President has reverted to the short game. The U.S. may be ever so slightly less dangerous as a place to live, but it will certainly be seen as a smaller nation, one that is inward-looking versus forward thinking, reactionary versus visionary.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi pledged that Expedia would work with employees to \"ease any pain or difficulties you are having\" as a result of the ban.\n\nNew York Times Co. CEO Mark Thompson and Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger\n\n\"We are committed to diversity of talent, thought and ideas and the fair and equal treatment of all employees, whatever their background,\" they said in a memo to staff. \"We will do everything in our power to support and protect every one of our colleagues, regardless of their race, country of origin, and religion or belief system.\"\n\nThey specified they were speaking as employers, not about the editorial opinion or news reporting of The Times. The Times editorial board on Saturday called the ban cruel, bigoted, cowardly and self-defeating.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook\n\nCook issued a letter, obtained by CNN, reacting to what he called \"deep concerns\" among employees. He assured workers that Apple (AAPL, Tech30) does not support Trump's policy and the company is prepared to help them.\n\n\"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\" Cook said.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle (GOOG) sent a memo to its employees urging anyone with a visa or green card from one of the banned countries to cancel travel plans.\n\n\"Please do not travel outside of the U.S. until the ban is lifted. While the entry restriction is currently only in place for 90 days, it could be extended with little or no warning,\" reads the memo, which was reviewed by CNN.\n\nMicrosoft executive Brad Smith\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT, Tech30) said it employs 76 people that could be affected by the ban. Smith said in an email to employees, which was shared on LinkedIn, that it will provide \"legal advice and assistance\" to those affected.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink\n\nHe wrote to employees: \"We, of course, all want to promote security and combat terrorism, but we believe it needs to be done with respect for due process, individual rights and the principle of inclusion.\"\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey\n\nDorsey called the potential impact of Trump's decision \"real and upsetting.\"\n\nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. https://t.co/HdwVGzIECt \u2014 jack (@jack) January 28, 2017\n\nGeneral Electric CEO Jeff Immelt\n\nImmelt said, in a memo on the G (GE)employee blog, that he shares the \"concern\" felt by his employees and said the company has many employees from the countries named in the ban.\n\n\"These employees and customers are critical to our success and they are our friends and partners,\" he wrote, adding that GE would \"stand with them\" and try to find a balance between security and \"movement of law abiding people.\"\n\nImmelt was one of 28 business leaders named to a council to advise Trump on manufacturing growth.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nThe bank said it has reached out to employees on sponsored visas who could be affected by the executive order. CEO Jamie Dimon is on Trump's business and economic council.\n\n\"We want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase (JPM),\" the statement said.\n\nTrip Advisor CEO Stephen Kaufer\n\nTrip Advisor's (TRIP) CEO wrote in a Linkedin post that Trump's immigration ban is \"not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.\"\n\nKaufer also said in a tweet that \"We need to do more, not less, to help refugees,\" and said the action was \"wrong on humanitarian grounds, legal grounds, and won't make us 'safer.'\" In a separate tweet, he called out Republican lawmakers: \"You can't sit this one out.\"\n\nWe need to do more, not less, to help refugees. Trumps action was wrong on humanitarian grounds, legal grounds, and won't make us \"safer.\" \u2014 stephen kaufer (@kaufer) January 29, 2017\n\nChorus CEO Dick Costolo\n\nChorus CEO and former Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) chief executive Costolo called Trump a \"a coward\" on Saturday.\n\nSalesforce executive Vala Afshar\n\nAfshar tweeted a list of U.S. tech companies that were founded by immigrants, including Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google (GOOG) and IBM (IBM, Tech30).\n\nUS tech companies founded by 1st/2nd generation immigrants \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nAmazon\n\nOracle\n\nIBM\n\nUber\n\nYahoo\n\nEMC\n\neBay\n\nAT&T\n\nTesla\n\nReddit \u2014 Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) January 28, 2017\n\nY Combinator cofounder Paul Graham\n\nGraham said, \"This is a good time to remember that without immigration the U.S. will only have 5% of the top people in each field.\"\n\nThis is a good time to remember that without immigration the US will only have 5% of the top people in each field. https://t.co/px0bA0Ou9x \u2014 Paul Graham (@paulg) January 28, 2017\n\nY Combinator president Sam Altman\n\nAltman criticized Trump's move in a blog post.
