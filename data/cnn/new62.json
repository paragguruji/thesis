Some Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) are in support of a ban on U.S. nationals, while others say they will urge Washington to reconsider.\n\nIf a ban is enacted it could impact thousands of American aid workers, contractors and journalists currently working in Iraq, as well as more than 5,000 U.S, military personnel there to aid Iraqi forces in their effort to oust ISIS from Mosul and the country.\n\nIran Says to Ban U.S. Visitors in Retaliation to Trump Move\n\n\u201cThis decision by the U.S. is arbitrary,\u201d said Intisar Al-Jabbouri, a Sunni MP from the Nineveh Governorate in northern Iraq. \u201cThe Iraqi government has the right to reciprocate.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. withdrew troops from Iraq in 2011, but since ISIS captured swathes of Iraqi territory in 2014, it has slowly sent advisors, trainers and special forces back to the country. Their guidance \u2014 as well as weapons and funding \u2013 has been key to the fight against ISIS.\n\nIraqi forces are battling the militants of the so-called Islamic State in the neighborhoods of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city and the largest urban center still under ISIS control. American military advisors are nearby, helping to direct the fight.\n\n\u201cIf Iraq were to ban U.S. citizens from traveling to Iraq it would have devastating consequences for our fight against ISIS, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations,\u201d said Chris Harmer, a senior analyst with the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. \u201cThat\u2019s just in the short term.\u201d\n\nTrump Refugee Order Dashes Hopes of Iraqis Who Helped the U.S.\n\nNevertheless the idea has caught on in certain, influential circles. Moqtada Al-Sadr, a powerful Shi\u2019ite cleric who led a violent insurgency in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, quickly issued a statement saying Americans should leave. \u201cIt would be arrogant for you to enter freely to Iraq and other countries while barring them the entrance to your country,\u201d Sadr said on his website, addressing the U.S. \u201cAnd therefore you should get your nationals out.\u201d\n\nSadr\u2019s motivations may have more to do with his alignment with Iran, however, than reciprocity for President Trump\u2019s ban on Iraqi nationals. \u201cThose that closely aligned with Iran might think this is a good idea\u2014an opportunity to remove American influence from Iraq once and for all,\u201d said Dr. Renad Mansour, an Academy Fellow for the Middle East and North Africa at Chatham House.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s order could exacerbate cracks in the already fragile coalition in Iraq, in which groups who receive support from the U.S. fight in concert with those who are backed by Iran. Iranian generals have been spotted on the frontlines in key battles against ISIS, both in Iraq and Syria. Shi\u2019ite militias, many funded by Tehran, are ruthless fighters but have been accused of abuses against civilian populations, fueling sectarian tensions.\n\nDozens Barred From Flying Out of Istanbul Airport after Trump Ban\n\nMansour says Sadr and those with his very powerful movement will try to stoke those tensions further by pressuring the government to ban Americans. The Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of mostly Shi\u2019ite militias, also issued a statement on Sunday urging Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to kick out U.S. nationals. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tricky for [Prime Minister] al-Abadi to deal with,\u201d said Mansour.\n\nDespite the strong rhetoric and anti-American sentiment in response to Trump\u2019s decision, lawmaker Jabbouri says it would be difficult for Iraq to approve and implement such a ban given the essential role the U.S. plays in both its military and humanitarian efforts. \u201cThere is a strategic need to keep American experts to ensure the sustainability of the coalition fight against ISIS,\u201d she says. However, leaders of some of the parliament\u2019s most powerful blocs have called the for ban on Americans.\n\nBut if the Iraqi people demand even a temporary ban on U.S. personnel, it could provide an opening for Iran to extend its influence on the country. The U.S. scaling-back of operations have already left room for an increasing Iranian presence, Harmer says. \u201cLong term, it would complete the decline of U.S. strategic influence in Iraq and pave the way for Iran to increase their already significant influence over the Iraqi government.\u201d The effect, he says, would be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on TIME.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["iran", "isis", "risk", "iraqi", "citizens", "fight", "ban", "nationals", "iraq", "statement", "threatens", "trumps", "influence", "putting"], "summary": "Some Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) are in support of a ban on U.S. nationals, while others say they will urge Washington to reconsider.\nTheir guidance \u2014 as well as weapons and funding \u2013 has been key to the fight against ISIS.\n\u201cIf Iraq were to ban U.S. citizens from traveling to Iraq it would have devastating consequences for our fight against ISIS, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations,\u201d said Chris Harmer, a senior analyst with the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\nIranian generals have been spotted on the frontlines in key battles against ISIS, both in Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cThere is a strategic need to keep American experts to ensure the sustainability of the coalition fight against ISIS,\u201d she says."}
