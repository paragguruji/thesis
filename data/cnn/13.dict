Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe. - Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 16, 2017\n\n\" @ realDonaldTrump , your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution,\" Warren continued, appearing to echo former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tweet when the Ninth Circuit Court upheld a halt on Trump's first travel ban in February.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans. - Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 16, 2017\n\nFor more on Elizabeth Warren, watch Fortune's video:\n\n\"Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans,\" the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts implored at the end of her tweetstorm.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Kevin Lui", "type": "article"}
