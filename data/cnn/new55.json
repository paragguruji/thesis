Kennedy Airport\u2019s Terminal 4, where they will monitor the effects of the ban and assist passengers where needed, 1010 WINS\u2019 Glenn Schuck reported.\n\n\u201cWe have an army of over 1,000 lawyers who have their back and are ready to go back out to JFK if that becomes necessary,\u201d said Camille Mackler, Director of Legal Initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition.\n\nMackler said travelers coming in Thursday are already approved.\n\n\u201cIn terms individuals arriving at the United States\u2026 they should already have visas approved, and are not subject to the ban, the injunction, the stay on the injunction or anything like that,\u201d Mackler said.\n\nAs 1010 WINS\u2019 Andrew Falzon reported, Mackler emphasized the need to hold President Trump accountable.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind the president that he is accountable to the American people, and to the court system, and to the Congress ultimately,\u201d she said.\n\nIn particular, Mackler took issue with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow part of the ban to stand until the case is heard in the fall.\n\n\u201cI think that their interpretation was just so narrow that really, it defies even a common sense belief of what the Supreme Court could have reasonably expected would have been the implementation of this standard that they created,\u201d she said.\n\nMacler said they don\u2019t expect the same kind of chaos they saw at the airport the first time the travel ban kicked in back in January, Schuck reported.\n\n\u201cFor now it seems, just from the way that the second order was written and also from the Supreme Court\u2019s pretty limited stay on the injunction, that most of those who will be impacted are actually abroad,\u201d Mackler said.\n\nLower courts previously blocked the controversial policy, but earlier this week the Supreme Court partially restored Trump\u2019s executive order.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "lawyers", "courts", "ban", "supreme", "court", "wins", "trumps", "takes", "shop", "president", "york", "mackler", "set", "effect", "jfk", "injunction"], "summary": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s revised temporary travel ban went into effect Thursday.\nVisa applicants in those six Muslim-majority countries will have to prove a relationship with family already in the U.S. to enter.\nAs 1010 WINS\u2019 Andrew Falzon reported, Mackler emphasized the need to hold President Trump accountable.\nIn particular, Mackler took issue with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow part of the ban to stand until the case is heard in the fall.\nLower courts previously blocked the controversial policy, but earlier this week the Supreme Court partially restored Trump\u2019s executive order."}
