Today is Pandemonium Day , giving you the perfect excuse to leave the dishes undone and the house a mess. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door . (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here .)\n\n1. Health care bill\n\nGOP senators' latest attempt at fixing health care is a secret no more . It includes an amendment by Ted Cruz that would let insurers offer cheaper, bare-bones policies . Conservatives like that, but moderates don't, because they fear it would drive up premiums for folks with pre-existing conditions. The bill still includes cuts to Medicaid and keeps two Obamacare-era taxes on rich people. Is this version enough to get Majority Leader Mitch McConnell the 50 votes he needs to pass this thing ? We still don't know. Rand Paul said he won't even vote for a motion to debate the bill. Susan Collins says she won't either, until she sees the all-important CBO score, which is due out Monday.\n\n2. President Trump\n\nPresident Trump is enjoying Bastille Day in Paris , including watching a parade down the Champs-Elysees, but the Russia storm brewing back in Washington churns on . Trump, during a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, defended son Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, saying most people working on a campaign would have taken that meeting (nope, says former Rep. Steve Israel, who's actually conducted opposition research ). Trump also said he didn't know about the meeting until a couple of days ago and that he's open to his son testifying about it.\n\n3. Pennsylvania missing men\n\nWhat happened to four young men who disappeared in Pennsylvania is a mystery no more. Cosmo Dinardo confessed to involvement in the killings of the men, his attorney said, though he wouldn't say if Dinardo actually killed them. In exchange for the confession, prosecutors say they won't seek the death penalty. Dinardo was already in custody; he'd been charged with stealing and trying to sell one of the men's cars. Dinardo reportedly told police where to find the bodies. The body of one man, Dean Finocchiaro, was found on property owned by Dinardo's parents, buried with other human remains.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lawyer: Man confesses in case of missing men Replay More Videos ...

At least two suspects rode on mopeds in east London, throwing acid on people, police said. One male teenager has been arrested. The attacks all happened within about an hour of each other. Five men were hospitalized, including one who suffered life-changing facial injuries. Robbery may have been a motive.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY\n\n17\n\nThat's how many years are left before the Social Security trust fund is tapped out , meaning future retirees (like a certain, unnamed newsletter writer) will only get about three-quarters of their benefits. Congress is being urged to act.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mulvaney: Trump wants to protect entitlements Replay More Videos ...
