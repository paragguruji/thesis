The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal has ordered the Justice Department to file its briefs by 6 p.m. EST Monday.\n\nThe San Francisco-based appeals court has already turned down a Justice Department request to set aside immediately a Seattle judge\u2019s ruling that put a temporary hold on the ban nationwide. That ruling last Friday prompted an ongoing Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and his decision \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nTrump renewed his Twitter attacks against Robart on Sunday. \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d He followed with another tweet saying he had instructed the Homeland Security Department to check people coming into the country but that \u201cthe courts are making the job very difficult!\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Sunday that \u201cwe don\u2019t appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about the national security.\u201d Trump himself had offered an optimistic forecast the previous night, telling reporters during a weekend at his private club in Florida: \u201cWe\u2019ll win. For the safety of the country, we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe government had told the appeals court that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, an assertion that appeared to invoke the wider battle to come over illegal immigration.\n\nCongress \u201cvests complete discretion\u201d in the president to impose conditions on entry of foreigners to the United States, and that power is \u201clargely immune from judicial control,\u201d according to the court filing.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, predicted the appeals court would not have the last word. \u201cI have no doubt that it will go to the Supreme Court, and probably some judgments will be made whether this president has exceed his authority or not,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his ruling, Robart said it was not the court\u2019s job to \u201ccreate policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\u201d but to make sure that an action taken by the government \u201ccomports with our country\u2019s laws.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome and however the case drags on, a president who was used to getting his way in private business is finding, weeks into his new job that obstacles exist to quickly fulfilling one of his chief campaign pledges.\n\n\u201cThe president is not a dictator,\u201d said Feinstein, D-Calif. \u201cHe is the chief executive of our country. And there is a tension between the branches of government.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter attacks on Robart \u2014 appointed by President George W. Bush \u2014 prompted scolding from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called senators. We don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pence defended the president, saying he \u201ccan criticize anybody he wants.\u201d The vice president added that he believes the American people \u201cfind it very refreshing that they not only understand this president\u2019s mind, but they understand how he feels about things.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 Muslim-majority countries that the administration said raise terrorism concerns. The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompting protests across the United States and leading to multiple court challenges.\n\nThe State Department said last week that as many as 60,000 foreigners from those seven countries had had their visas canceled. After Robart\u2019s decision, the department reversed course and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa.\n\nThe department also advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order would now be allowed in.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump\u2019s order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \u201csuspended any and all actions\u201d related to putting in place Trump\u2019s order.\n\nPence appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday.
