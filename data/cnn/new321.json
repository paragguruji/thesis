People do care about civil rights, justice, equality.\"", "authors": ["Deena Zaru"], "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["thats", "travel", "stereotypes", "trump", "ban", "farida", "talks", "think", "going", "trumps", "youre", "texas", "music", "artist", "rb", "negative"], "summary": "Austin, Texas (CNN) President Donald Trump's latest travel ban, which temporarily bars refugees and people from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the country, has reinforced negative stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims, according to R&B artist Farida.\n\"I don't think that's really something that you can fix.\"\nShe said that anti-immigrant rhetoric championed by right-wing politicians in the United States is mirrored in Europe and is exacerbating negative stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\"If you're Arab, you're a terrorist,\" the Norwegian-Algerian singer said, describing the stereotypes her community wrestles with.\n\"It's just so sad that some people are going to have one voice that's going to mean so much to a nation,\" she added."}
