He said the move would help protect Americans from terrorism.\n\nThe ban affects travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, including those with dual nationality that includes one of those countries, and extends on a case-by-case basis to \u201cgreen card\u201d holders who are authorised to live and work in the United States.\n\nAirbnb to Offer Free Housing to Blocked Travelers\n\nKadivar, once an active participant in Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution who later fell foul of its leaders, told Reuters from Berlin he was concerned about his family and career in America.\n\n\u201cI have a fellowship in Germany until July \u2026 but what happens after that is not clear. I am concerned about my future. I don\u2019t know whether I will be able to return to the United States as a green card holder Iranian national,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans in the United States, including those with U.S. citizenship, dual nationality and green card holders, so Trump\u2019s executive order could create myriad travel complications.\n\n\u201cMy two children and wife live in the United States \u2026 My wife was planning to join me in Berlin, where I arrived on July 18 and was supposed to stay until July \u2026 But we were advised by the university\u2019s immigration lawyers to cancel her trip to Berlin,\u201d Kadivar said.\n\nKadivar, a research professor of Islamic studies at Duke University in North Carolina since 2009, is an outspoken critic of Iran\u2019s hardline clerical leadership.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who was jailed for a year in Iran in 1999 for \u201cdisseminating lies and disturbing public opinion\u201d, has called for more autonomy from religion in political life and has been a staunch critic of Iran\u2019s most powerful authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nDozens Barred From Flying Out of Istanbul Airport after Trump Ban\n\nIn 2001, he travelled to the United States with an invitation from the Islamic Law Program of Harvard Law School for research and teaching. He was awarded the Hellman-Hammett Prize for writers deemed to be at risk from political persecution.\n\nKadivar said Trump\u2019s travel ban was \u201chumiliating and discriminatory\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have received so many emails from my colleagues, who regretted the ban \u2026 Iranians have never been involved in any terrorist act in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u2018TURNING IRANIANS HOSTILE\u2019\n\nThe United States and its allies in the Middle East accuse Iran of supporting terrorism and interfering in the affairs of regional states, including Syria, Yemen and Iraq \u2013 charges denied by Tehran.\n\nHardline allies of Khamenei, worried about losing their grip on power since a nuclear deal was reached with the United States and other world powers in 2015, have continued to denounce Washington publicly.\n\nMiddle Eastern Immigrants to U.S. Confront Upended Lives\n\nHowever, pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani has sought to reduce tensions with the United States. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a Rouhani ally, tweeted on Sunday that the travel ban was \u201ca great gift to extremists\u201d.\n\nThe Tehran government on Saturday vowed to retaliate by banning the entry of Americans, but Zarif said on Twitter that Americans who already hold Iranian visas could enter Iran.\n\n\u201cUnlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite differences in tone from factions, political analysts said the U.S. measures would unite Iran\u2019s political establishment to some extent, at least for a short while.\n\nIt would also turn public opinion firmly against the United States, they added.\n\nWhy Twitter Is Talking About Steve Bannon With the Hashtag #StopPresidentBannon\n\n\u201cBesides tearing apart many families, this ban is materialising an objective that the leadership in Tehran has not been able to achieve for decades since the revolution,\u201d said Ali Vaez from the International Crisis Group conflict research group.\n\n\u201cThat is turning Iranians hostile towards the United States. The top-down enmity towards the U.S. risks becoming bottom-up.\u201d\n\n\u2018NOT MY AMERICAN DREAM\u2019\n\nIranian author Azar Nafisi, a professor of English literature who has lived in the United States since 1997 and became a U.S. citizen nine years later, said the ban was contrary to American values.\n\n\u201cWe came to the United States because we believed it is a country of freedom, a country friendly to immigrants. People like me should raise their voice and express their concerns. This is not a political issue,\u201d said Nafisi.\n\nUber Responds to Accusations of \u2018Strikebreaking\u2019 During Protest\n\nAnother Iranian-born academic, Mohammad, said he was returning to his home in the United States after attending his father\u2019s funeral in Tehran, when the ban came into effect.\n\nTurkish Airlines refused to allow him to board his connecting flight to New York from Istanbul, he said.\n\nMohammad, 42, who refused to give his family name because he said he was concerned about administrative steps being taken against his U.S.-based family, said the ban was \u201ccertainly going to make things harder for mostly well-educated Iranian immigrants.\n\n\u201cI have a green card and have been living in the U.S. for years. My two little daughters are awaiting for me. What can my wife tell them?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not what I dreamed about America.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["academics", "travel", "trump", "ban", "political", "wife", "scared", "card", "stranded", "iranian", "united", "irans", "green", "states", "berlin"], "summary": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banned travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nI don\u2019t know whether I will be able to return to the United States as a green card holder Iranian national,\u201d he said.\nConfront Upended LivesHowever, pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani has sought to reduce tensions with the United States.\n\u201cWe came to the United States because we believed it is a country of freedom, a country friendly to immigrants.\n\u201cI have a green card and have been living in the U.S. for years."}
