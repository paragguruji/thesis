In a third step, he issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\nClose to 5 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the conflict there erupted in 2011. Millions more are displaced within Syria.\n\nFor more on the Trump administration and Syria, watch:\n\nMost refugees have settled in overburdened neighboring countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey where the struggle for survival has become increasingly difficult. Savings have run out, jobs are scarce and poorly paid, while refugee children learn in crowded classrooms and have very limited access to higher education.\n\nMany refugees say their first choice is to return home as soon as possible. But with the civil war dragging on, that\u2019s not an option and refugees increasingly pursue resettlement to the West because of tough conditions in regional host countries.\n\nInternational aid agencies harshly criticized Trump\u2019s restrictions imposed on refugees.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said the suspension of the refugee resettlement program was a \u201charmful and hasty\u201d decision. \u201cAmerica must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope,\u201d said IRC President David Miliband.\n\nTrump Refugee Order Dashes Hopes of Iraqis Who Helped the U.S.\n\nThe group said the U.S. vetting process for refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by 12 to 15 government agencies.\n\nJan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Trump\u2019s decision hurts innocents fleeing extremist violence in Syria.\n\n\u201cIt will not make America safer,\u201d Egeland told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Norway. \u201cIt will make America smaller and meaner. It\u2019s a really sad rupture of a long and proud American bi-partisan tradition that America would be there for those fleeing from terror and for the weak and the vulnerable in the world, which are the refugees.\u201d\n\nThe NRC is a leading refugee aid agency, assisting more than 1 million Syrians.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["syrian", "america", "sad", "trump", "security", "syrians", "refugee", "resettlement", "trumps", "refugees", "bans", "shocked", "decision"], "summary": "Syrian refugee Ammar Sawan took his first step toward resettlement in the United States three months ago, submitting to an initial round of security screenings.\n\u201cWe tell the American people that we hope he (Trump) retracts this decision,\u201d said refugee Mayada Sheik, 37.\nThe International Rescue Committee said the suspension of the refugee resettlement program was a \u201charmful and hasty\u201d decision.\nTrump Refugee Order Dashes Hopes of Iraqis Who Helped the U.S.\nJan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Trump\u2019s decision hurts innocents fleeing extremist violence in Syria."}
