McMaster have all advocated for Iraq to be removed from the administration's list of banned countries in the new executive order for diplomatic reasons, including Iraq's role in fighting ISIS. Homeland Security Secretary James Kelly also supported the move, but it remains unclear whether the White House has made a final decision on the issue.\n\nThe news of the pending announcement came as lawyers for the Justice Department stated in a court filing this week that the President plans to formally \"rescind\" the old travel ban and replace it with \"a new, substantially revised\" executive order.\n\nRead More", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-03-04", "authors": "Laura Jarrett and Tammy Kupperman, CNN", "type": "article"}
