In a third step, he issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\nClose to 5 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the conflict there erupted in 2011. Millions more are displaced within Syria.\n\nFor more on the Trump administration and Syria, watch:\n\nMost refugees have settled in overburdened neighboring countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey where the struggle for survival has become increasingly difficult. Savings have run out, jobs are scarce and poorly paid, while refugee children learn in crowded classrooms and have very limited access to higher education.\n\nMany refugees say their first choice is to return home as soon as possible. But with the civil war dragging on, that's not an option and refugees increasingly pursue resettlement to the West because of tough conditions in regional host countries.\n\nInternational aid agencies harshly criticized Trump's restrictions imposed on refugees.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee said the suspension of the refugee resettlement program was a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope,\" said IRC President David Miliband.\n\nTrump Refugee Order Dashes Hopes of Iraqis Who Helped the U.S.\n\nThe group said the U.S. vetting process for refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by 12 to 15 government agencies.\n\nJan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Trump's decision hurts innocents fleeing extremist violence in Syria.\n\n\"It will not make America safer,\" Egeland told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Norway. \"It will make America smaller and meaner. It's a really sad rupture of a long and proud American bi-partisan tradition that America would be there for those fleeing from terror and for the weak and the vulnerable in the world, which are the refugees.\"\n\nThe NRC is a leading refugee aid agency, assisting more than 1 million Syrians.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "The Associated Press", "type": "article"}
