Though the Trump administration has focused on its restrictions on the flow of new refugees to the U.S., Homeland Security officials speaking with ProPublica have said the ban also affects as many as 500,000 current legal U.S. residents from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.\n\nA flood of reports indicate that legal U.S. residents are being detained at airports, prevented from boarding flights to the U.S., and even sent back to their countries of origin after landing in the U.S., despite their legal right to enter the country. That appears to include both permanent residents who have been issued green cards, and those admitted to the U.S. legally as students or temporary foreign workers.\n\nIn response to the order, Google has ordered its affected international workers travelling abroad to return to the U.S. , though it\u2019s now unclear whether they will be allowed to.\n\nThe executive order does grant the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security discretion to admit travelers from affected countries on a case-by-case basis . One stated criteria for that admission is membership in \u201ca religious minority in his [sic] country of nationality facing religious persecution.\u201d That suggests that in addition to becoming part of a political litmus test, affected travelers\u2019 social media profiles could be mined for religious data.\n\nFor more on Trump and the Muslim ban, watch our video.\n\nThough the current executive order is limited to 120 days, it also calls for the creation of new screening standards for immigrants\u2014the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d cited by Trump during the presidential campaign. In part, that would include \u201ca mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.\u201d\n\nThat open-ended and subjective standard presents the possibility that, with or without tech companies\u2019 active involvement , authorities may use social media data as part of sweeping restrictions on Muslim immigration.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "David Z.
