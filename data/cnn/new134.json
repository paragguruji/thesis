They are not \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" In fact, as my colleague Peter Bergen noted Saturday, every terror attack on US soil since 9/11 has been carried out by US citizens or US legal residents, not by visa holders or refugees.\n\nFriday, I asked on Twitter for stories of those affected by President Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nHi all, Please tweet me if the Trump travel ban affects you directly. I want to hear your stories. Thank you.\n\nAnd I received numerous responses. Here are a few of them:\n\nFather weeps over the news\n\n@jimsciutto I've genuinely never seen my father cry before. I don't know what to even do\n\nSon concerned over father's travel plans\n\n@jimsciutto my father is a univ professor @WVUTech and travelled to Iran for his fathers funeral, he holds a GC and we are concerned. \u2014 \u2624Amir Eslami OMS-IV (@MrAmirEslami) January 28, 2017\n\nStudent worried he won't be able to see his family\n\n@jimsciutto I'm an Iranian PhD student in the US and I can't visit my family anymore.I guess I'm going to switch to Masters and go back ASAP \u2014 _ (@J__qu) January 28, 2017\n\nBusinessman who can't travel for meetings\n\n@jimsciutto It affects me. Have visa, can't travel to US for meetings. My company has half billion $ business with US space contractors. \u2014 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a (@Hadi_Alhassani) January 28, 2017\n\nDoctor unable to attend conference\n\n@jimsciutto I am a physician. My husband is a scientist. We were going to attend a conference in Portland in March and now we can't. \u2014 Nami (@namihos) January 28, 2017\n\nFather not able to see his children\n\n@jimsciutto My Iranian American father has a cousin who has children and grandchildren here in the US. He will no longer be able to see them. \u2014 Katie G (@KatieKins17) January 28, 2017\n\nStudent's education on hold\n\n@jimsciutto From Iran.
