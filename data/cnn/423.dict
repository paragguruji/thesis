Some people voiced objection to the President's proposed border wall. In other places people spoke out for rights for refugees, immigrants and LGBT Americans.\n\nThe gatherings took place one day after a federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary stay on the President's immigration ban executive order.\n\nThe White House quickly responded in a statement, saying the Justice Department will fight to block the order \"at the earliest possible time.\"\n\nHere is what was happened around the nation Saturday.\n\nWashington\n\nProtesters walked along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the US Capitol to \"deliver a clear message to the doorsteps of President Trump, members of Congress, and the courts,\" according to a Facebook event page.\n\nAt the front of the pack, participants held a banner across the front row saying, \"No Ban,\" referring Trump's January 29 executive order that temporarily bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nProtest stopping to chant outside Trump's hotel pic.twitter.com/WW1lmQyKCL \u2014 Bullneck (@Bullneck) February 4, 2017\n\nDemonstrators also stopped outside the new hotel owned by the Trump family before moving on.\n\nRamin Mehdizadeh, an Iranian who founded an architectural firm in Washington, told CNN he is worried his parents in Iran won't be able to come to the United States to see their grandchildren. He is also concerned that something would happen if he went overseas and tried to return.\n\n\"I have a life here. I have a business here. It is so scary,\" he said.\n\nChristine Montgomery, born and raised in the capital, said many immigrants marched alongside her African-American family and friends in the Washington \"Black Lives Matter\" protests.\n\n\"Before, they were sympathizing with us. Now they're empathizing with us, \" she said.\n\nMelissa Jackson agreed, saying Trump is ironically uniting Americans with his executive orders.\n\n\"With him in office, he's really bringing this country together,\" she said, pointing to the crowd's diversity.\n\nNew York\n\nThe LGBT community and supporters rallied at Stonewall National Monument to speak out against Donald Trump.\n\nCNN affiliate WABC reported thousands of people congregated in Greenwich Village at the Stonewall National Monument , voicing opposition to the stances of the White House on LGBT issues.\n\nFour arrests were made on Saturday during the protests, the NYPD told CNN.\n\nStonewall was the country's first national monument honoring the LGBT movement. WABC reported organizers called for a rally when a draft of an executive order circulated this week that would have curbed LGBT rights.\n\n\"This is an unpredictable White House that makes very erratic policy decisions ... so we believe we have to be out in front of these fights,\" said Zeke Stokes, vice president of programs for GLAAD, an LGBT activist group.\n\n#stonewall rally pic.twitter.com/QiUOhsCj1m \u2014 CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) February 4, 2017\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke at the rally, leading several \"Dump Trump\" chants.\n\nProtesters also spoke out for other groups that they believe are being discriminated against.\n\n\"As a member of the LGBT community, I'm here to say that whether you are Muslim, whether you are Latino or Latina, an immigrant or a refugee or anybody else whose been antagonized by this demagogic tyrant, we have your back,\" said New York City Councilman Corey Johnson. \"We have the responsibility to look out for each other.\"\n\nWest Palm Beach\n\nA sizable crowd stretched a mile down the sidewalk on Flagler Drive as thousands of people walked towards President Trump's weekend residence.\n\nAcross the water, the lights of Mar-a-Lago seemed to be off. Later, fireworks went off above the club, likely at the end of a fundraiser being held.\n\nOn the West Palm Beach side, a few dozen pro-Trump counterprotesters showed up and at one point there was a tense moment when a man got out of a pickup with a Trump flag. When there was a physical altercation, police moved in. It did not appear that anyone was detained.\n\nWe are outside, Donald!

After staying there for a few hours, the protesters went home.\n\nBut before departing, they sang the Star-Spangled Banner and chanted, \"U-S-A!\" One man yelled \"Hey, we are all on the same team.\"\n\nTrump supporters heckled marchers, saying, \"This is your president.\"\n\nMiami\n\n\"No ban, no wall,\" protesters said as they walked through Miami to the Miami-Dade County courthouse, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.
