It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\u201d\n\nI don't wake up every day looking for a way to sue Donald Trump. But we are 10 days in and I've filed three cases already. \u2014 Maura Healey (@maura_healey) January 31, 2017\n\nTrump appointed Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until the Senate confirms Senator Jeff Sessions. (\u201cHe is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons,\u201d the White House statement added.) Boente was sworn in around 9 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nBoente is a 31-year veteran of the Justice Department. He oversaw the prosecution of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell (later overturned by the Supreme Court) as well as cases against U.S. Rep. William J. Jefferson and former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin.", "authors": ["Andrew Nusca"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["executive", "justice", "betrayal", "statement", "fired", "department", "general", "attorney", "acting", "yates", "order", "white", "house"], "summary": "The White House on Monday night relieved Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama administration appointee, after she directed Justice Department attorneys not to defend President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial executive order blocking U.S. entry for citizens of seven nations in the Middle East and Africa.\n\u201cThe acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,\u201d the statement read.\n\u2014 Maura Healey (@maura_healey) January 31, 2017Trump appointed Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until the Senate confirms Senator Jeff Sessions.\n(\u201cHe is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons,\u201d the White House statement added.)\nBoente is a 31-year veteran of the Justice Department."}
