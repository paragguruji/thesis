A U.S. appeals court later on Saturday denied the government\u2019s request for an immediate stay of the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government,\u201d Pence said on NBC\u2019s program Meet the Press.\n\nAs Trump Tightens Immigration, Canada Courts Talented U.S. Tech Workers\n\nIt is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check on the power of the executive branch and Congress.\n\nU.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\n\nSome Republicans also expressed discomfort with the situation.\n\n\u201cI think it is best not to single out judges for criticism,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union program. \u201cWe all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Ben Sasse, a vocal critic of Trump, was less restrained.\n\nElon Musk Pushed Muslim Travel Ban to Top of Trump Meeting Agenda\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges \u2026 we don\u2019t have so-called presidents, we have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,\u201d he said on ABC News program This Week.\n\nThe ruling by Robart, appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, along with the decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to deny the government\u2019s request for an immediate stay dealt a blow to Trump barely two weeks into his presidency.\n\nIt could also be the precursor to months of legal challenges to Trump\u2019s push to clamp down on immigration, including through the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician, who during his presidential campaign called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, has vowed to reinstate the travel ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day bar on all refugees.\n\nHe says the measures are needed to protect the United States from Islamist militants. Critics say they are unjustified and discriminatory.\n\nVisa Holders Hurry to Board Flights to U.S. Amid Reprieve\n\nThe legal limbo will prevail at least until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the government\u2019s application for a stay of Robart\u2019s ruling. The court was awaiting further submissions from the states of Washington and Minnesota on Sunday, and from the government on Monday. The final filing was due at 5 p.m. PST on Monday (0100 GMT on Tuesday).\n\nThe uncertainty has created what may be a short-lived opportunity for travelers from the seven affected countries to get into the United States.\n\nSara Yarjani\u2019s visa was marked \u201crevoked\u201d in red Sharpie pen\u2014but the Iranian student visa holder was attempting a return to Los Angeles on Sunday after she was sent back to Vienna, where she had been visiting her parents, last week under the immigration order.\n\nHer sister, Sahara Muranovic, said Yarjani got on a flight back to Los Angeles once she learned that Trump\u2019s order had been blocked. She was slated to arrive on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis is our only window,\u201d Muranovic said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll blow it again by Monday.\u201d\n\nCondoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright Say Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban Is a Bad Idea\n\nReacting to the latest court ruling, Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said: \u201cIt is a move in the right direction to solve the problems that it caused.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 27 travel restrictions have drawn protests in the United States, provoked criticism from U.S. allies and created chaos for thousands of people who have, in some cases, spent years seeking asylum.\n\nIn his ruling on Friday, Robart questioned the use of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States as a justification for the ban, saying no attacks had been carried out on U.S. soil by individuals from the seven affected countries since then.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be \u201cbased in fact, as opposed to fiction\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s a Fact Check on the Bowling Green \u2018Massacre\u2019\n\nThe 9/11 attacks were carried out by hijackers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon, whose nationals were not affected by the order.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump attacked \u201cthe opinion of this so-called judge\u201d as ridiculous.\n\n\u201cWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\u201d he asked.\n\nTrump told reporters at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida late on Saturday: \u201cWe\u2019ll win. For the safety of the country we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department appeal criticized Robart\u2019s legal reasoning, saying it violated the separation of powers and stepped on the president\u2019s authority as commander-in-chief.\n\nThe appeal said the state of Washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order \u201cfavors Christians at the expense of Muslims.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Muslim Ban: 200,000 Uber Users Have Deleted the App\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security said they were complying with Robart\u2019s order and many visitors were expected to start arriving on Sunday, while the government said it expected to begin admitting refugees again on Monday.\n\nA spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, Leonard Doyle, confirmed on Sunday that about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel to the United States. \u201cWe expect a small number of refugees to arrive in the U.S. on Monday, Feb. 6th. They are mainly from Jordan and include people fleeing war and persecution in Syria,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nIraqi Fuad Sharef, his wife and three children spent two years obtaining U.S. visas. They had packed up to move to America last week, but were turned back to Iraq after a failed attempt to board a U.S.-bound flight from Cairo.\n\nIraq Relieved Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Revoked By U.S. Appeals Court\n\nOn Sunday, the family checked in for a Turkish Airlines flight to New York from Istanbul.\n\n\u201cYeah, we are very excited. We are very happy,\u201d Sharef told Reuters TV. \u201cFinally, we have been cleared. We are allowed to enter the United States.\u201d\n\nRana Shamasha, 32, an Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, was due to travel to the United States with her two sisters and mother on Feb. 1 to join relatives in Detroit until the trip was canceled as a result of the travel ban.\n\nShe was waiting to hear from U.N. officials overseeing their case. \u201cIf they tell me there is a plane tomorrow morning, I will go. If they tell me there is one in an hour, I will go,\u201d she told Reuters by telephone in Beirut. \u201cI no longer have a house here, work, or anything.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "ban", "judge", "order", "court", "united", "states", "trumps", "pence", "blocked", "defends", "president", "criticism"], "summary": "The uncertainty has created what may be a short-lived opportunity for travelers from the seven affected countries to get into the United States.\nHer sister, Sahara Muranovic, said Yarjani got on a flight back to Los Angeles once she learned that Trump\u2019s order had been blocked.\nFor Trump\u2019s order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be \u201cbased in fact, as opposed to fiction\u201d.\n\u201cWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\u201d he asked.\nIraq Relieved Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Revoked By U.S. Appeals CourtOn Sunday, the family checked in for a Turkish Airlines flight to New York from Istanbul."}
