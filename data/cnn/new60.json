The order also bans refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, and gives priority admission to Christians.\n\nThough House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were among some of the first to back the President\u2019s decision, many other members of the GOP have condemned the action.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country,\u201d the speaker said Friday, according to the Post.\n\nBelow is a list of Republican elected officials who have criticized the ban, and what they\u2019ve said in response to it.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.):\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. \u201cI guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world,\u201d he said, according to the Post.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cThis 90-day ban could imperil the lives of this family and potentially others, and it\u2019s unacceptable, and I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be reinstated.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.):\n\nFlake publicly opposed the ban in a Medium post on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry,\u201d Flake wrote. \u201cEnhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.\u201d\n\nRep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.):\n\nIn a Twitter post, Amash wrote that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lawful to ban immigrants on basis of nationality. If the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress,\u201d he tweeted, before adding that the denial of green card holders is, \u201cparticularly troubling.\u201d\n\n1/ Like Pres. Obama's executive actions on immigration, Pres. Trump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.):\n\nThough Sasse agrees with Trump\u2019s decision to protect the country\u2019s borders, the Post reports, he said that the ban is \u201ctoo broad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cOur generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME):\n\nCollins released a statement criticizing Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cA preference should not be given to people who practice a particular religion, nor should a greater burden be imposed on people who practice a particular religion. As I stated last summer, religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our American values.\u201d\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins is 4th Republican to criticize Trump's Exec. Order: \"Religious tests\u2026run contrary to our American values.\" pic.twitter.com/dimsEVY5SN \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 29, 2017\n\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA):\n\nComstock wrote that though she believes in \u201cincreased vetting based on national security concerns,\u201d she wrote that the President\u2019s executive order \u201cwent beyond the increased vetting actions that Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis and inexplicably applied to green card holders, people who are legally within our country who have followed the rules.\u201d\n\nGOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is at least the 5th Republican to hit Trump's EO: \"Went beyond the increased vetting actions\" Congress supported. https://t.co/48DSW3h3F8 \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 29, 2017\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):\n\nMcCain and Graham released a joint statement on the immigration ban Sunday, saying that, \u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have serves as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in a country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees ho have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d they continue, \u201cwe fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe latter statement echoes a similar notion Sen. McCain emphasized early Sunday: On CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, McCain said that Trump\u2019s order on immigration will \u201cprobably in some areas give ISIS more propaganda.\u201d\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-OH)\n\nPortman, a member of the Homeland Security Committee, said Trump\u2019s new vetting procedure was itself \u201cnot properly vetted.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Portman said that while the U.S. does need to \u201ctighten things up,\u201d Trump\u2019s approach was hasty and inconsistent with American values and national security interests.\n\n\u201cIn my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security and again for this notion that America has always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\u201d Portman said. \u201cIn fact, we are more welcoming than any country in the world and we should continue to be so.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\n\nPresident of the Senate Finance Committee and Utah Senator Hatch, recalled that many of his own ancestors \u201cwere themselves refugees, religious minorities violently driven from their homes who undertook a long and dangerous journey to build a new life in a distant land.\u201d The Senator urged the Trump administration to \u201cmove quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible\u201d and reduce \u201cunnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise\u2014not a threat\u2014to our nation.\u201d\n\nSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.):\n\nThough Heller told the Post that he supports better vetting and border protection, he said he is \u201cdeeply troubled by the appearance of a religious ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe use of an overly broad executive order is not the way to strengthen national security,\u201d he said. \u201c\u200eI encourage the Administration to partner with Congress to find a solution.\u201d\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.):\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s policy entirely misses the mark,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nFitzpatrick said that he thinks terrorism inspired by radicalism requires a \u201ccomprehensive response,\u201d not a \u201cpurely regional focus.\u201d Though he does think serious actions should be taken to protect the country, \u201cthese must not be done in a way that singles out any specific nations or ethnicities,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.):\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s executive order was announced, Lehtinen said she \u201cobjected to the suspension of visas\u201d from the seven countries that are included in the ban. Instead, she suggests that \u201cwe could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures,\u201d the Miami Herald reports.\n\n\u201cBoth the letter and the spirit of the rule of law, on which our liberties rest, require that we honor legal commitments and procedures established by law, including existing visas and approved refugee status, absent specific articulable reasons for reversing a prior decision. The new Administration needs to pay careful attention to crafting orders that honor existing legal commitments and existing law, in contrast to this broad brush approach which doesn\u2019t focus on the precise problems,\u201d she told the Herald in a statement Saturday.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.):\n\nIn a Facebook post, Stefanik wrote that she thinks the country needs to both reform and strengthen its vetting process. However, she opposes Trump\u2019s immigration ban\u2014writing that \u201cOn the House Armed Services Committee, I have advocated for Iraqi and Afghans who have served side by side as our allies to be prioritized to access visas. It is Congress\u2019 role to write our immigration laws and I strongly urge the President to work with Congress moving forward as we reform our immigration system to strengthen our homeland security.\u201d\n\nCory Gardner (R-Colo.):\n\nThough Gardner said he is supportive of the country\u2019s screening processes, \u201cthe travel blanket goes too far,\u201d he said, according to the Post.\n\n\u201cI also believe that lawful residents of the United States should be permitted to enter the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI urge the Administration to take the appropriate steps to fix this overly broad executive order.\u201d\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.):\n\nInstead of fighting extremism alone, Hurd stressed that the U.S. should work with its allies.\n\n\u201cThis visa ban is the ultimate display of mistrust and will erode our allies\u2019 willingness to fight with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ban also provides terrorist with another tool to gain sympathy and recruit new fighters.\u201d\n\nBreaking: GOP Congressman @HurdOnTheHill calls #TravelBan \"ultimate display of mistrust\", \"will erode allies' willingness to fight w/us.\" pic.twitter.com/iKldgnGDqQ \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) January 29, 2017\n\nRep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.):\n\nWhile Lance says the Trump Administration should be concerned about \u201cthe security and safety of the American people,\u201d he says the executive order went too far: Lance wrote in a Facebook post that \u201cthe President\u2019s current travel ban executive order appears rushed and poorly implemented. Reports of green card holders and those who assisted us in the War on Terror being denied or delayed entry into the U.S. is deeply concerning and must be remedied immediately.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt is Congress\u2019 role to amend our immigration laws and I strongly urge President Trump to work with legislators to enact a clear, effective and enhanced vetting and monitoring process.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio):\n\nLike many of the other Republicans who oppose the ban, Stivers agrees with Trump that the nation should improve its vetting process. However, he believes that \u201cthe executive order risks violating our nation\u2019s values and fails to differentiate mainstream Islamic partners from radical Islamic terrorists\u2014setting back our fight against radical Islam. I urge the Administration to quickly replace this temporary order with permanent improvements in the visa vetting process,\u201d he said, according to the Post.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.):\n\nToomey supports increased vetting, as well as a temporary suspension of \u201ccertain individuals from states that sponsor or provide safe havens to terrorists, or are too weak to prosecute terrorists within their borders.\u201d However, the senator does think the initial executive order was flawed\u2014saying that it was \u201ctoo broad and poorly explained.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis apparently resulted in denied entry into the United States for lawful permanent residents and others who should have been allowed immediate entry,\u201d he said, according to the Post.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.):\n\nWhile Moran said he supports \u201cthorough\u201d vetting, he does not support \u201crestricting the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents,\u201d he said, the Post reports.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["executive", "congress", "ban", "immigration", "vetting", "republicans", "post", "security", "criticized", "trumps", "country", "order", "president"], "summary": "At least 20 Republicans have spoken out against President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that bans immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nBelow is a list of Republican elected officials who have criticized the ban, and what they\u2019ve said in response to it.\nTrump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.\n\u201cOur generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\u201dSen.
