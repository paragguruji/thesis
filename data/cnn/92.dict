Jessica Kourkounis\u2014Getty Images\n\nA federal court will soon decide whether President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily blocking travel from seven majority-Muslim countries can stand.\n\nAttorneys for Minnesota and Washington, as well as a group of former high-level government officials including Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, filed in the Ninth Circuit on Monday, arguing against the order . The Department of Justice will file in defense of the order later on Monday.\n\nOutside of government, 97 companies , including tech giants Apple , Google , Microsoft and Facebook, also filed a legal brief in the challenge, saying the ban \"inflicts significant harm on American business.\" The companies say the order inhibits growth and hurts both their employees and their customers.\n\n\u201cSkilled individuals will not wish to immigrate to the country if they may be cut off without warning from their spouses, grandparents, relatives, and friends \u2014 they will not pull up roots, incur significant economic risk, and subject their family to considerable uncertainty to immigrate to the United States in the face of this instability,\" the companies say, according to a copy of the brief posted on TechCrunch .\n\ngA full list of the companies that signed onto the brief is below:\n\n1.AdRoll, Inc.\n\n2.Aeris Communications, Inc.\n\n3.Airbnb, Inc.\n\n4.AltSchool, PBC\n\n5.Ancestry.com, LLC\n\n6.Appboy, Inc.\n\n7.Apple Inc.\n\n8.AppNexus Inc.\n\n9.Asana, Inc.\n\n10.Atlassian Corp Plc\n\n11.Autodesk, Inc.\n\n12.Automattic Inc.\n\n13.Box, Inc.\n\n14.Brightcove Inc.\n\n15.Brit + Co\n\n16.CareZone Inc.\n\n17.Castlight Health\n\n18.Checkr, Inc.\n\n19.Chobani, LLC\n\n20.Citrix Systems, Inc.\n\n21.Cloudera, Inc.\n\n22.Cloudflare, Inc.\n\n23.Copia Institute\n\n24.DocuSign, Inc.\n\n25.DoorDash, Inc.\n\n26.Dropbox, Inc.\n\n27.Dynatrace LLC\n\n28.eBay Inc.\n\n29.Engine Advocacy\n\n30.Etsy Inc.\n\n31.Facebook, Inc.\n\n32.Fastly, Inc.\n\n33.Flipboard, Inc.\n\n34.Foursquare Labs, Inc.\n\n35.Fuze, Inc.\n\n36.General Assembly\n\n37.GitHub\n\n38.Glassdoor, Inc.\n\n39.Google Inc.\n\n40.GoPro, Inc.\n\n41.Harmonic Inc.\n\n42.Hipmunk, Inc.\n\n43.Indiegogo, Inc.\n\n44.Intel Corporation\n\n45.JAND, Inc. d/b/a Warby Parker\n\n46.Kargo Global, Inc.\n\n47.Kickstarter, PBC\n\n48.KIND, LLC\n\n49.Knotel\n\n50.Levi Strauss & Co.\n\n51.LinkedIn Corporation\n\n52.Lithium Technologies, Inc.\n\n53.Lyft, Inc.\n\n54.Mapbox, Inc.\n\n55.Maplebear Inc. d/b/a Instacart\n\n56.Marin Software Incorporated\n\n57.Medallia, Inc.\n\n58.A Medium Corporation\n\n59.Meetup, Inc.\n\n60.Microsoft Corporation\n\n61.Motivate International Inc.\n\n62.Mozilla Corporation\n\n63.Netflix, Inc.\n\n64.NETGEAR, Inc.\n\n65.NewsCred, Inc.\n\n66.Patreon, Inc.\n\n67.PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n68.Pinterest, Inc.\n\n69.Quora, Inc.\n\n70.Reddit, Inc.\n\n71.Rocket Fuel Inc.\n\n72.SaaStr Inc.\n\n73.Salesforce.com, Inc.\n\n74.Scopely, Inc.\n\n75.Shutterstock, Inc.\n\n76.Snap Inc.\n\n77.Spokeo, Inc.\n\n78.Spotify USA Inc.\n\n79.Square, Inc.\n\n80.Squarespace, Inc.\n\n81.Strava, Inc.\n\n82.Stripe, Inc.\n\n83.SurveyMonkey Inc.\n\n84.TaskRabbit, Inc\n\n85.Tech:NYC\n\n86.Thumbtack, Inc.\n\n87.Turn Inc.\n\n88.Twilio Inc.\n\n89.Twitter Inc.\n\n90.Turn Inc.\n\n91.Uber Technologies, Inc.\n\n92.Via\n\n93.Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\n\n94.Workday\n\n95.Y Combinator Management, LLC\n\n96.Yelp Inc.\n\n97.Zynga Inc.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Maya Rhodan", "type": "article"}
