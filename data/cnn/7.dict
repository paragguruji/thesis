The decision has drawn large protests at many U.S. airports, where some travelers from those countries have been stranded.\n\nPresident Trump's Disapproval Rating Has Shot Up in the Past 4 Days\n\n\"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" Trump said. \"This is not about religion\u2014this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.\n\n\"We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,\" he said.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Reuters", "type": "article"}
