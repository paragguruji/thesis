Amazon, Expedia were witnesses in original suit. https://t.co/wv8LAH3OnG - David Zapolsky (@DavidZapolsky) February 6, 2017\n\nWhile it is not unusual to see companies' lawyers talk about cases on social media, Zapolsky's comment is notable given the political nature of the case, because Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have sparred in the past\u2014most notably when Trump suggested an antitrust suit against Amazon.\n\nTrump has also taken repeated shots at The Washington Post , a newspaper owned by Bezos that has criticized some of his decisions.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\n\nIn the wake of the 9th Circuit ruling, Trump has so far not attacked the companies that supported the legal challenge by Washington state. Instead, the President responded on Twitter with an all caps tweet that he would see the judges \"in court,\" prompting some humorous replies.\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\n\n\u201coh no, not court\u201d \u2014judges - Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) February 10, 2017\n\nPlease please please represent yourself in front of the Supreme Court. I'll never ask for anything else ever again. https://t.co/kNqncAijFN - Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) February 10, 2017\n\nThe case is now poised to head to the Supreme Court , which could decide whether Trump's order that bars people from certain countries (including green card holders) from the United States, should be halted while courts determine if it's constitutional.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Jeff John Roberts", "type": "article"}
