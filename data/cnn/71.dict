Four federal judges in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington state, subsequently issued stays on a ban that Cuban characterized, in a series of tweets over the weekend, as \"not vetted or thought through.\"\n\nCuban, like Trump himself, is a reality TV personality\u2014having appeared on ABC's Shark Tank for the last few years. And, like Trump, he is a Twitter ( twtr ) aficionado. Cuban is a self-made billionaire who sold startup Broadcast.com to Yahoo ( yhoo ) in 1999 for $5.7 billion . And he has never been shy about sharing his opinions\u2014whether the topic is NBA officiating or telecommunications policy , or politics.\n\nTens of Thousands in U.S. Cities Protest Trump Immigration Order People gather at Terminal 4 during a protest against Donald Trump's travel ban at John F.

Critics have pointed out the conspicuous absence of Saudi Arabia, and other predominantly Muslim countries that have been tied to the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. but that also have strong business ties with this country.\n\nOn Saturday, Google chief executive Sunder Pichai, for example, told Google ( goog ) employees traveling abroad who would be affected by the executive orders to return to the U.S. as soon as possible.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mcuban/status/825563211915223041\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mcuban/status/826044887409766400\n\nBusiness Insider has more about the latest tweetstorm, which came a day after Cuban criticized Trump's policy on Mexico , saying the president's plan to impose a 20% tariff on Mexican imports would lead to a trade war.\n\nFor more on reaction to Trump's travel ban, watch:\n\nCuban endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in her bid for the White House last July but had previously toyed with the idea of backing Trump, as noted in this Fortune timeline.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Barb Darrow", "type": "article"}
