Then a three-judge panel will decide whether to schedule a hearing or issue a ruling.\n\nJustice Department lawyers face an uphill battle to vacate the lower court's order, but in making their arguments, they've laid out a broad defense that will replay in other upcoming challenges.\n\nThe lawyers' language is in stark contrast to that of the President, who tweeted Saturday: \"The judge opens our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!\"\n\nThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nStanding\n\nThe first line of attack in the 30-page brief centers on whether the two states involved, Washington and Minnesota, have the legal right to be in court. It's a threshold issue -- called \"standing\" -- but courts take it very seriously. A state has to prove that it has been harmed in order to bring the challenge.\n\nNoel J. Francisco, the acting-solicitor general who signed the brief, quotes precedent and stresses it is \"no part\" of a state's \"duty or power\" to enforce its citizens' rights in respect of their relations with the federal government.\n\nFrancisco dismisses one argument put forward by Washington -- that its public universities will be harmed by the executive order-- noting that \"most if not all of the students and faculty members the state identifies are not prohibited from entering the United States.\"\n\nHe argues the state's arguments are not good enough because they have \"identified only speculative harms it would suffer from temporary suspension of the entry of aliens affected by the order.\"\n\nHe then turns to the President's power in the area of immigration. Again quoting precedent, he writes that the President's authority in the area \"is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED DOJ files appeal to travel ban suspension Replay More Videos ...
