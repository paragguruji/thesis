That court ordered both sides to submit arguments for and against the ban by Monday night.\n\nThe 9th Circuit scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday evening in the matter. Lawyers will make their cases to three federal judges in an hourlong hearing to determine the immediate fate of the temporary restraining order.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the loser is expected to appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nHow has Trump taken it?\n\nHe's fuming. Over the weekend he fired off several tweets blasting Robart's decision , in one referring to the Bush appointee as a \"so called\" judge.\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nIn another, he said, \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\"\n\nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017\n\nTrump's Justice Department sent out a strongly worded filing, emphasizing that halting enforcement of the travel ban \"harms the public\" and \"second-guesses the President's national security judgment\" in the immigration context.\n\n\"(Robart's ruling) contravenes the considered judgment of Congress that the President should have the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens,\" the Justice Department wrote.\n\nAre people traveling?\n\nRobart's ruling suspended the ban, and the rejection of the appeal means it's no longer in effect until the ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nRecent Clemson University graduate Nazanin Zinouri touched down in Boston's Logan International Airport early Sunday afternoon after more than a day of air travel from Tehran -- she had left the US on vacation on January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nJUST WATCHED The battle continues over travel ban Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Christian refugees skeptical of travel ban 03:09\n\nLawyers for Washington state and Minnesota asked the court to leave the temporary restraining order in place, arguing that the government has failed to show that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by a suspension of the executive order.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the government said Robart's injunction should be lifted and the executive order should go back into effect while the legal process continues.\n\n\"The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,\" the Justice Department wrote in a brief.\n\nThe panel will hear oral arguments Tuesday and is expected to rule shortly after.\n\nAfter the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court. A rehearing is not required, though, in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court. Given the high stakes, it is expected that whomever ultimately loses before the 9th Circuit will most likely appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nHow have others reacted?\n\nJUST WATCHED McConnell weighs in on Trump travel ban Replay More Videos ...

So no matter what the ruling is in San Francisco, the next stop will likely be the US Supreme Court\n\n\"Ultimately, one way or another, this case ends up at the Supreme Court,\" writes CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos.\n\n\"Other cases are pending throughout the country, and the odds are that there will be a serious split among the federal appellate courts, one that can only be resolved by the high court.\n\n\"That same court, of course, is currently composed of eight members and capable of a 4-4 split. That's where it gets strange. When cases tie at the Supreme Court, then the appellate court's decision stands.\"", "authors": ["Euan Mckirdy"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["ruling", "executive", "travel", "speed", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "judge", "court", "order", "refugees", "trumps", "hurdles", "hits", "legal"], "summary": "Regardless of the outcome, the loser is expected to appeal to the US Supreme Court.\nJUST WATCHED The battle continues over travel ban Replay More Videos ...
