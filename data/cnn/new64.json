Discrimination is no response,\u201d said French Foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, while his British counterpart Boris Johnson tweeted: \u201cDivisive and wrong to stigmatise because of nationality.\u201d\n\nAlong with Syria, the U.S. ban affects travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nTrump said his order, which indefinitely bans refugees from Syria, was \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d, though he added he would seek to prioritise Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country.\n\nWashington\u2019s Arab allies, including the Gulf states and Egypt, were mostly silent.\n\nFor more on world leaders and Trump, watch:\n\nThe government in Iraq, which is allied with Washington in the battle against ultra-hardline Islamist group Islamic State and hosts over 5,000 U.S. troops, also did not comment on the executive order.\n\nBut some members of the parliament said Iraq should retaliate with similar measures against the United States.\n\nIn Baghdad, influential Shi\u2019ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said American nationals should leave Iraq, in retaliation for the travel curbs.\n\n\u201cIt would be arrogance for you to enter freely Iraq and other countries while barring to them the entrance to your country \u2026 and therefore you should get your nationals out,\u201d he said on his website.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction to the curbs from Islamic State, although in the past it has used U.S. monitoring of Muslim foreigners to stoke Muslim anger against Washington.\n\nTrump Refugee Ban Causes Chaos, Panic, Anger Worldwide\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order on Friday took effect immediately, wreaking havoc and confusion for would-be travellers with passports from the seven countries and plunging America\u2019s immigration system into chaos. U.S. civil rights and faith groups, activists and Democratic politicians vowed to fight the order.\n\nThe Tehran government vowed to respond in kind to the U.S. ban on visitors from Iran, but on Sunday Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that Americans who already hold Iranian visas can enter the country.\n\n#MuslimBan shows baselessness of U.S. claims of friendship with the Iranian people while only having issues with the Government. 4/7 \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\nWhile respecting Americans & differentiating between them &hostile U.S. policies, Iran will take reciprocal measures to protect citizens.5/7 \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\nFull statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the #MuslimBan. 6/7 pic.twitter.com/Y3gAxT0B8m \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017\n\nUnlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive.

You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d\n\nThe travel curbs, however, also drew criticism from several other countries around the globe.\n\nIn Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the Muslim-majority nation deeply regretted Trump\u2019s plans for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of people from some Muslim countries.\n\nThe US decision not to allow entry of people from certain countries is NOT fair.
