Along with personal concerns about human rights and equity, many tech leaders see the President\u2019s attempts to restrict immigration\u2014including visas for skilled guest workers\u2014as potentially throttling the stream of global talent that has allowed American companies to dominate the global technology industry.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nMusk\u2019s continued engagement with Trump is risky, given that many of his educated, high-income, and climate-conscious customers likely oppose the Trump administration. It stands in contrast to the decision of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to leave the council this week.\n\nKalanick\u2019s departure came on the heels of a viral #deleteuber boycott that accused Uber (probably speciously) of interfering with a taxi drivers\u2019 strike in opposition to Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban. At the time of his departure, Kalanick wrote to employees that \u201cThe implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration\u2019s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are.\u201d\n\nMusk has repeatedly made clear that his participation in the council meetings is not an endorsement of Trump administration policies, and observers seem to have largely accepted his reasoning. While Buzzfeed News recently reported on a handful of customers cancelling pre-orders for the forthcoming Tesla Model 3, there has been no sign of a groundswell akin to the #deleteuber boycott.\n\nRegarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017\n\nTwitter responses to Musk were cautious, but frequently supportive.\n\nsurely the only guaranteed way he will have less of a + influence is not showing up @ all \u2014 Fee (@FiveOhFour) February 4, 2017\n\nHerr Dictator already has a voice. Musk is a rational voice whispering in his ear. That seems good to me\u2026 \u2014 robert davies (@robsMast) February 4, 2017\n\nMusk also said he raised the issue of climate change during the meeting. It\u2019s an issue that has animated Musk\u2019s entire career, but Trump has expressed extreme skepticism about climate change, and his administration has already moved to quash the subject.\n\nIn addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017\n\nThe lingering question, of course, is whether President Trump is likely to be influenced by input that conflicts with his own worldview, even when it comes from one of the most admired people in America.", "authors": ["David Z.
