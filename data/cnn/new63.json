In a memo to workers that IBM sent to Fortune, Diane Gherson, IBM Senior Vice President of Human Resources, said the company\u2019s \u201cfirst priority has been to identify and engage IBMers who may be affected, in order to provide any assistance they need.\u201d She said the company had so far pinpointed three IBMers \u201cdirectly affected by the executive order, and none have concerns at this time.\u201d\n\nThe company is working to ensure that IBM employees with affected families are supported and receive necessary assistance, Gherson wrote. It established a phone number for employees with border entry emergencies.\n\nSubscribe to The World\u2019s Most Powerful Women, Fortune\u2019s daily must-read for global businesswomen.\n\nIBM has long sought to balance the \u201cflow of people, ideas, commerce and information with the needs of security, everywhere in the world,\u201d according to Gherson\u2019s memo. Gherson said CEO Ginni Rometty \u201coften remind[s]\u201d employees of that philosophy. Not mentioned in the memo is Rometty\u2019s participation in the CEO advisory group that Trump assembled in December.\n\nGherson\u2019s memo continued:\n\nAs IBMers, we have learned, through era after era, that the path forward\u2014for innovation, for prosperity, and for civil society\u2014is the path of engagement and openness to the world. Our company will continue to work and advocate for this.\n\nThe backlash from the tech industry signals the deterioration of the uneasy detente Trump and some Silicon Valley leaders had settled into following his election win in November.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, \u201cIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.\u201d The travel ban ensnared some 187 Googlers who hail from the countries it targets. Apple CEO Tim Cook weighed in as well, writing in his own memo to his workforce that the company\u2014founded by Steve Jobs, the son of an immigrant from Syria, one of the impacted countries\u2014\u201cwould not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, said the U.S. should focus its security measures on \u201cpeople who actually pose a threat.\u201d\n\nRometty was especially vocal following Trump\u2019s victory, penning an open letter to him on November 15 that outlined several bi-partisan steps she thought the new administration could take to help create jobs. Her message to Trump irked at least one employee. A senior content strategist wrote her own open letter to Rometty and announced she was resigning.\n\nA spokesman for IBM said the company had \u201cnothing to add\u201d when Fortune asked whether Trump\u2019s immigration ban would alter Rometty\u2019s role on the president\u2019s advisory board.\n\nThe ban has prompted protests across the United States, but Trump defended it on Sunday. \u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion\u2014this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d", "authors": ["Claire Zillman"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["openness", "wrote", "world", "trump", "ibmwhose", "ban", "immigration", "trumpcalls", "advises", "memo", "company", "ceo", "order", "ibm", "employees"], "summary": "Gherson said CEO Ginni Rometty \u201coften remind[s]\u201d employees of that philosophy.\nNot mentioned in the memo is Rometty\u2019s participation in the CEO advisory group that Trump assembled in December.\nA spokesman for IBM said the company had \u201cnothing to add\u201d when Fortune asked whether Trump\u2019s immigration ban would alter Rometty\u2019s role on the president\u2019s advisory board.\nThe ban has prompted protests across the United States, but Trump defended it on Sunday.\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting."}
