The tweet refers to the unanimous decision Thursday by a three-judge panel in federal appeals court to continue to block the order. The panel ruled that the Trump administration could not offer sufficient evidence to support a need for the ban.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Trump fired back with an all-caps tweet:\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political decision, we\u2019re going to see them in court, and I look forward to doing that,\u201d Trump said about the decision on Thursday.\n\nAn hour later, Clinton took to Twitter to express her own views:\n\n3-0 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017\n\nBut the social media drama didn\u2019t stop there. Conway then jumped in with some shade of her own, tweeting the three key states that Clinton lost during the election.\n\nThere\u2019s so much happening on Twitter, it\u2019s getting hard to keep up. In the meantime, Trump has continued tweeting about the court ruling calling it \u201ca disgraceful decision.\u201d", "authors": ["Polina Marinova"], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["clintons", "ruling", "travel", "clinton", "presidential", "trump", "ban", "tweeting", "conway", "kellyanne", "court", "twitter", "shade", "hillary", "fires", "panel", "decision"], "summary": "Hillary Clinton fired out a three-character tweet on Thursday that lit up Twitter and garnered an equally terse response from presidential aide Kellyanne Conway.\nThe panel ruled that the Trump administration could not offer sufficient evidence to support a need for the ban.\nFollowing the ruling, Trump fired back with an all-caps tweet:SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\nConway then jumped in with some shade of her own, tweeting the three key states that Clinton lost during the election.\nIn the meantime, Trump has continued tweeting about the court ruling calling it \u201ca disgraceful decision.\u201d"}
