In all the conversations, everyone expressed concern for those fleeing persecution and war but emphasized the desire for the United States to protect its borders.\n\nAlso see faces of those impacted by the travel ban\n\nMark Kauzlarich for CNN Danny Eapen 25, New York\n\nDanny Eapen, the son of Indian parents, was born and raised in Qatar, and he said he is used to being \u201cextremely screened\u201d when he travels back home to visit his family over the holidays. He doesn\u2019t mind it though. His positive attitude permeated his voice as he explained that, \u201cWhen I was flying from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Doha, Qatar, I was extremely screened by immigration because they wanted to know why a guy with an Indian passport born and raised in the Middle East is flying back to Doha. That was under (the) Obama administration. So when it happened, I wasn\u2019t mad at them or upset because I know as soon as I touch back in Doha they\u2019re going to do the exact same thing or even worse.\u201d He said in Qatar, \u201cif someone is flying from Jordan into Doha and they see there is a stamp on their passport that they were in Iraq, the airport security would question them. \u2026 People in the Middle East get screened by others in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nEven though Eapen couldn\u2019t vote, he campaigned for Trump and said he doesn\u2019t see the ban as a Muslim ban because so many Muslim-majority countries, such as Indonesia, were left off the list. He saw it as more of an effort to target certain problematic hot spots in the world.\n\nMatthew Coughlin for CNN Susan Richardson 71, Florida\n\nSusan Richardson is an immigrant from England. She came to the United States in 1965 and considers it an enormous honor. She supports the travel ban because she believes that any sovereign country has the absolute right to protect its borders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a legal immigrant,\u201d said Richardson, an oil painter and artist who\u2019s been an entrepreneur for years. \u201cWhen I came to this country, if you didn\u2019t have the right visa, if you didn\u2019t have somebody who sponsored you, you were turned back at the airport.\u201d\n\nShe said there should be a firm vetting process but believes allowances should be made for women, children and the elderly who are fleeing war-torn areas. She thinks that single, military-aged men should be back home aiding the war efforts.\n\n\u201cWe (Americans) are very generous people. I\u2019m from England and Brits are generous people, too. \u2026 I\u2019m not anti-Muslim, I\u2019m anti-violence.\u201c\n\nBrinson+Banks for CNN Rebecca Meyer 39, California\n\nRebecca Meyer is a schoolteacher in southern California who spoke with CNN last month about Trump\u2019s first travel ban, which was blocked by a federal judge. She said that while she supported Trump\u2019s decision to pause travel from certain countries, she had some criticism for the way he went about it. After Trump\u2019s latest executive order, she thinks the ban is less restrictive and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cI think any good leader who comes into a position and they feel like they need to take a timeout or a pause in order to re-evaluate -- that\u2019s good leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take a minute to look at a policy. And yes, it\u2019s going to be inconvenient to some, but in the grand scheme of things, it takes time to evaluate things that have to do with national security and safety.\u201d\n\nMeyer said this new order seems like Trump is being a little more flexible and maybe listening to some of the dissenters and fixing some things they wanted to see changed: \u201cSounds like maybe he\u2019s making some changes in order to strengthen the relationship we have with Iraq and defeating ISIS.\u201d Meyer spoke carefully of the situation, knowing it\u2019s complex, and she said, \u201cI always try to put myself in the shoes of those who disagree.\u201d\n\nDustin Chambers for CNN Eric Johnson 53, Georgia\n\nEric Johnson voted for Trump because national security was a priority to him, but he suggested that Trump could do a better job with how he implemented and communicated the first ban. \u201cI agree with his objective, I most likely agree with his decision, but I think he\u2019s got to do a better job on how he presents it to the American people,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cAmerica, we are a country that has open arms to people. We are compassionate. ... We also have to realize our objective for those people who are doing the right thing, we want to be sensitive to them because we don\u2019t want to send a message to people who are the good ones that you\u2019re not welcome in America. If those (executive order) changes are improving that area of compassion for law-abiding people coming here, that\u2019s a good measure.\u201d\n\nJohnson suggested that Trump could support more programs, nonprofits and churches who are working on supporting and aiding refugees. \u201cLet\u2019s work with the Red Cross and other international organizations. Help those people who feel they\u2019re suffering as a result of ISIS and in Syria and let\u2019s try to support them. Let\u2019s not do anything to jeopardize our security, because if we are not safe then we can\u2019t help them.\u201d\n\nMelissa Golden/Redux for CNN Amanda Patrick 38, Georgia\n\nAmanda Patrick is a tax associate with a 5-year-old son. She said she\u2019s not opposed to immigrants coming into the country through the proper steps and vetting processes, but she said \u201cthe biggest thing for me, especially with having a child now, is the safety factor. Just people coming in that we aren\u2019t properly vetting.\u201d\n\nRegarding refugees, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t have issue with the people who have been properly vetted. I think (Trump\u2019s first executive order) probably came down a little too quickly, perhaps a little too harshly, especially with people caught mid-travel. Let them make it through the airport, let us do the vetting on our end, and put them in a safe place if they were truly coming through on those proper channels.\u201d\n\nShe believes it\u2019s a good thing the executive order was re-written. She said it seems like Trump had more input from advisers and had put more thought into it, which she hopes will alleviate some of the tension overall.\n\nIsaac Brekken for CNN Robert Reed 71, Nevada\n\nRobert Reed was 19 when he came to the United States from England, full of hope for the future. A few months after arriving on American soil, he was drafted to go fight in Vietnam. \u201cI served in Vietnam, honorably, (for 13 months) and I\u2019m very proud of that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe felt apprehensive and a little scared after being drafted, but he stated that he wasn\u2019t at all resentful. \u201cI was proud to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt by serving, in some ways, would be advantageous for my future. I feel resentful of people who didn\u2019t serve and found a way out and dodged the draft. When I came back, we didn\u2019t talk about it \u2013 we were verbally attacked in some cases that we were even there because it was a very unpopular war. I felt very proud that I served.\n\n\u201cWhich is another reason why I feel that, having served the United States proudly, I earned something, the right to be here. People coming here illegally have earned no right whatsoever.\u201d\n\nReed is now retired after being self-employed. He voted for Trump in November -- not because he necessarily liked Trump, he said, but because he did not trust the Clintons.\n\nMelissa Golden/Redux for CNN Betty Norris 49, Alabama\n\nBetty Norris, a manager at Highway Pickers Antique Mall & Market, said she supports the travel ban even though she thinks Trump\u2019s first one was done hastily. She supports people coming to this country legally, getting jobs and paying taxes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be here, you need to do what we are required by law to do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have more privileges or less privileges if you do what I do, my neighbor does: pay your taxes, pay your bills and work.\u201d\n\nRegarding refugees, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a horrible situation, I think it\u2019s a dire situation, and as a mom, my heart goes out to those children, it hurts my heart.\n\n\u201cEvery country, I think, needs to put money in the pot for this fund. \u2026 Those countries that people are leaving from? They have some responsibility to their own people. \u2026 Why are they not taking care of their own people? I think that needs to start there.\u201d", "section": "politics", "type": "Article", "title": "In support of a travel ban"}
