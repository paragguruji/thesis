According to rules that govern the Supreme Court, the justices would take into consideration whether there is a \"reasonable probability\" that four of the justices would eventually agree to hear the case and a \"fair prospect\" that a majority of the court will hold that the lower court opinions were erroneous.\n\nThey'd also consider if \"irreparable harm\" would result from the denial of the request to lift the injunction.\n\nRead More", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "authors": "Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter", "type": "article"}
