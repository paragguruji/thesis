Top congressional Republicans, however, remain largely behind the new president.\n\nDuring a round of Sunday show interviews, Trump\u2019s aides stressed that just a small portion of travelers had been affected by the order, which temporarily bars the citizens of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the country. The aides also reversed course and said that citizens of those countries who hold permanent U.S. residency \u201cgreen cards\u201d will not be barred from re-entering the country, as officials had previously said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine too many people out there watching this right now think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask a few more questions from someone traveling in and out of Libya and Yemen before being let loose in the United States,\u201d insisted Trump\u2019s chief of staff Reince Priebus. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all this is.\u201d\n\nTens of Thousands in U.S. Cities Protest Trump Immigration Order 1 of 31 Advertisement\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, one legal permanent resident had been denied entry to the country as a result of the order, according to a federal law enforcement official. The official was not permitted to discuss the order\u2019s impact publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe changes, said White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, are \u201ca small price to pay\u201d to keep the nation safe.\n\nStarbucks CEO Wants to Hire 10,000 Refugees\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the order, which also suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria, will accomplish that. The order does not address homegrown extremists already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. And the list of countries in Trump\u2019s order doesn\u2019t include Saudi Arabia, where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from.\n\nPriebus said that other countries could be added to the list.\n\nThe order has sparked widespread protests and denunciations from Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Many have accused the administration of rushing to implement the changes, resulting in panic and confusion at the nation\u2019s airports.\n\n\u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have had,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who urged the new president to \u201cslow down\u201d and work with lawmakers on how best to tighten screening for foreigners who enter the United States.\n\n\u201cIn my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security\u201d and reflects the fact that \u201cAmerica\u2019s always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Koch Brothers Oppose President Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban\n\nThe comments came the morning after a federal judge in New York issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from the seven majority Muslim nations subject to Trump\u2019s 90-day travel ban. The judge said travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated.\n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, however, said Sunday said the court ruling would not affect the overall implementation of the White House order.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\nIraq Threatens Ban on U.S. Citizens, Putting the Fight Against ISIS at Risk\n\nTop congressional Republicans, meanwhile, were backing Trump despite concerns raised Sunday from a handful of GOP lawmakers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he supports more stringent screening mechanisms, though he cautioned that Muslims are some of the country\u2019s \u201cbest sources in the war against terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea to tighten the vetting process But I also think it\u2019s important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism are Muslims, both in this country and overseas,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stressed the need \u201cto be careful as we do this,\u201d and said it would be up to the courts to decide \u201cwhether or not this has gone too far.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, warned of unintended consequences, expressing fear the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nLyft Pledges $1 Million to ACLU after Trump Travel Restrictions\n\n\u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTrump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the U.S.\n\nKoch political network, which is among the most influential players in the conservative movement, also condemned the plan Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d network co-chairman Brian Hooks said in a statement. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families.\u201d\n\nPriebus was on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press and Portman was on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, while McConnell appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "price", "trump", "immigration", "security", "republicans", "vetting", "small", "trumps", "country", "order", "house", "white", "safety"], "summary": "The changes, said White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, are \u201ca small price to pay\u201d to keep the nation safe.\nThe order does not address homegrown extremists already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials.\nAnd the list of countries in Trump\u2019s order doesn\u2019t include Saudi Arabia, where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, however, said Sunday said the court ruling would not affect the overall implementation of the White House order.\nThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,\u201d they wrote."}
