U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump\u2019s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary.\n\nTrump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson\u2019s order \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach.\u201d\n\nTech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump\u2019s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the \u201cfriend-of-the-court\u201d brief this time around.\n\nCompanies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. \u201cWe do expect the group to expand.\u201d\n\nRide-hailing company Uber Technologies was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said.\n\nBox (box), a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position.\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump\u2019s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further.
