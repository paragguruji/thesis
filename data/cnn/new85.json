Critics and rivals interpreted Uber\u2019s actions as a sign of support for Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, and a movement on Twitter\u2014#DeleteUber\u2014then sprouted. Uber users were pushed to leave the ride-hailing service.\n\nRival car-hailing service Lyft, which seized the moment to pledge $1 million to the ACLU, overtook Uber in total App Store downloads on Sunday. Under pressure from angry users, Kalanick then left Donald Trump\u2019s business advisory council Thursday, just a day before the group was scheduled to meet with the president.\n\nStill, 200,000 is a mere fraction of Uber\u2019s total numbers. In October, Kalanick said the app had roughly 40 million monthly active users. The deleted accounts would amount to just 0.5% of that total. And that percentage could be even lower, if Uber has since added users or a portion of the deletions came from inactive users.", "authors": ["Lucinda Shen"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["trump", "ban", "immigration", "deleted", "kalanick", "total", "support", "donald", "uber", "trumps", "ubers", "protest", "million", "muslim", "200000", "users", "app"], "summary": "The problems started when Uber turned off surge pricing for trips to New York\u2019s JFK Airport amid protests of Trump\u2019s immigration ban.\nUber users were pushed to leave the ride-hailing service.\nUnder pressure from angry users, Kalanick then left Donald Trump\u2019s business advisory council Thursday, just a day before the group was scheduled to meet with the president.\nStill, 200,000 is a mere fraction of Uber\u2019s total numbers.\nAnd that percentage could be even lower, if Uber has since added users or a portion of the deletions came from inactive users."}
