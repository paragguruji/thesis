On Saturday, Sacca promised to match up to the first $25,000 of donations resulting from his offer but he later raised the limit to $150,000. Sacca is known for his early investments in Twitter (twtr) and Uber as well as appearances ABC\u2019s startup competition show Shark Tank.\n\nTens of Thousands in U.S. Cities Protest Trump Immigration Order 1 of 31 Advertisement\n\nFred Wilson and Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures joined the fund-raising race on Sunday, offering matches for up to $20,000. as did Foundry Group\u2019s Brad Feld. There\u2019s also a handy list of matching funders.\n\nThe ACLU, which provides legal services to underserved people, went to court to fight the executive orders this weekend. Four federal judges subsequently issued a stay on the ban.\n\nThe @aclu took Trump to court. Let's stand with them.

Logan Green and John Zimmer, co-founders of the Lyft ride-sharing service pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just tech luminaries. On Saturday, pop star Sia promised to match the first $100,000 flowing in. Hollywood hyphenate (writer-producer-director-actor) Judd Apatow followed her lead.\n\nOkay @sia. We are all going to join you. I am in! https://t.co/XN8tqp7sPX \u2014 Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) January 29, 2017\n\nSo did actress/comedian (and frequent Trump foil) Rosie O\u2019Donnell.
