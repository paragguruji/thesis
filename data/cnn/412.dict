The new restrictions impact business travelers and current employees from seven countries for an initial period of 90 days. The current restrictions are not limited to visa holders, but also extend to permanent residents who are citizens of those countries.\n\nOur immediate focus is on identifying and reaching out to people who may be affected. We are providing them with a range of support, including legal advice and assistance.\n\nIf you have any questions about how you and your family may be impacted, please contact your business unit HR manager.\n\n21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U.S., founded by \u2013 and comprising at all levels of the business \u2013 immigrants. We deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of America\u2019s strength. Moreover, as a company that is driven by creativity and innovation, we recognize the unique perspective offered by our many people who came to the U.S. in search of the opportunity for unfettered self-expression.\n\nWe will continue to monitor developments in what is still a fluid situation. We will keep you informed as we learn more.\n\nIn the meantime, please know that the well-being of our colleagues is our top priority.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Kate Samuelson", "type": "article"}
