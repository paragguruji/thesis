He contended that federal judges did not have the power to review Trump's executive order, which bars citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days.\n\nIt also prevents entry for all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts the admission of refugees from Syria.\n\nFrom the start, Flentje repeatedly sought to emphasize the government's position that a lower court acted beyond his powers when it suspended the President's executive order last Friday. Flentje argued that the President acted within his constitutional powers.\n\n\"This is a traditional national security judgment that is assigned to the political branches and the President and the court's order immediately altered that,\" Flentje argued.\n\nThe three-judge panel at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals pressed Flentje on whether the government could show that the seven countries affected by Trump's ban were connected to terrorism.\n\n\"Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism,\" asked Judge Michelle Friedland.\n\nJUST WATCHED Families Unite Amid Travel Ban Showdown Replay More Videos ...

But it is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the President's national security determination based on some newspaper articles,\" he said.\n\nStanding\n\nAt least two of the three judges appeared to accept the threshold issues of the case -- whether the plaintiffs have the ability, or legal standing, to sue.\n\nPurcell, for Washington state, argued that the Trump administration could not demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is allowed to remain in place. On the other hand, state residents would suffer and state governments have lost tax revenue as a result of the executive order, he argued.\n\nBut Clifton also was skeptical of the state's argument on standing, wondering how many people in Washington would be harmed by the executive order.\n\n\"I suspect it is a small fraction,\" the judge said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's travel ban supporters call in Replay More Videos ...

He argued that foreign nationals outside the US, who have never stepped foot on American soil, had no constitutional right to enter the country.\n\nThat argument didn't seem to get much traction: Purcell said it would not fully address the harms of the executive order.\n\n\"It would not remedy the order's violation of the establishment clause which harms everyone in our state ... by favoring one religious group over another. It also would not fully remedy the order's violation of the equal protection law -- denying some of our residents who are here, allowing them to receive those visits and so on,\" Purcell argued.\n\nHow will the court rule?\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation, to the point where some Republican lawmakers have even pushed to split it up in an effort to limit its impact.\n\nBut Kari Hong, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School, said Tuesday's hearing was technical in nature.\n\n\"The Ninth Circuit is often called a liberal court, but the issues they have to figure out today are dry and technical ones relating to standards of review and the deference owed to the lower court,\" Hong said. \"Those issues will be resolved without regard to political preferences.\"\n\nThe President was kept up to date on the hearing by White House Counsel Don McGahn Tuesday night, CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported. A ruling is expected this week.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of the story misstated Noah Purcell's title.
