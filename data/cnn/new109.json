A federal judge in Seattle put the first order on hold, in a decision upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco.\n\nThe new order is much more narrowly tailored. It keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, but excludes Iraq and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants. It also removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.\n\nThe order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.\n\nImmigration advocates have said the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims.\n\nBut the first hurdle in a lawsuit is proving \u201cstanding\u201d to sue, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals that a court would rule have a right to sue.\n\nState claims harm\n\nHawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. It also says the island state\u2019s economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. The court papers cite reports that travel to the United States \u201ctook a nosedive\u201d after Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nThe state was joined by a new plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an Imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii whose mother-in-law lives in Syria, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThis second Executive Order is infected with the same legal problems as the first Order,\u201d the state said in court papers filed on Tuesday. The President\u2019s order \u201cis subjecting a portion of Hawaii\u2019s population, including Dr. Elshikh, his family, and members of his Mosque, to discrimination and second-class treatment,\u201d Hawaii said.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Elshikh fears his mother-in-law will not be able to enter the country under the new order. \u201cThe family is devastated,\u201d the filing said.\n\nOne of the groups eligible for waivers under the new ban are those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry.\n\nAdam Lauridsen, a San Francisco attorney representing students challenging Trump\u2019s first order, said the waiver provisions in the new ban are similar to case-by-case exemptions allowed in the first ban. Earlier legal challenges were allowed to move forward despite those waivers, he said.\n\nIn support of its actions, the Trump administration has cited a section of law that says the president can suspend entry to the United States by \u201cany class\u201d of foreigners if he finds it would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests\u201d of the country.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-09", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "hawaii", "ban", "challenge", "state", "court", "files", "states", "trumps", "order", "president", "legal"], "summary": "Arguing that the new travel ban violates the U.S. Constitution, the state asked a Hawaii federal court to grant a temporary restraining order that should apply nationally.\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled earlier in the day that the state could sue over Trump\u2019s new order, which was signed by the president on Monday.\nWatson said the state could revise its initial lawsuit, which had challenged Trump\u2019s original ban signed in January.\nThe court papers cite reports that travel to the United States \u201ctook a nosedive\u201d after Trump\u2019s actions.\nAdam Lauridsen, a San Francisco attorney representing students challenging Trump\u2019s first order, said the waiver provisions in the new ban are similar to case-by-case exemptions allowed in the first ban."}
