Trump, the first federal case to challenge the travel ban. US District Court Judge Donnelly in the Eastern District of New York originally issued a nationwide temporary restraining order on January 28, preventing the removal of those who were legally authorized to enter the US. Donnelly also ordered the government to provide a list of individuals who were detained pursuant to the executive order but did not specify what time period should be covered.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the ACLU's request, US District Court Judge Carol Bagley Amon ordered the Trump administration to produce the names by 5 p.m. on Thursday. Amon's order includes anyone who, at any time during the period from 9:37 p.m. ET on January 28 until 11:59 p.m. ET on January 29, was being \"held, including being processed,\" by US Customs and Border Protection pursuant to the executive order.\n\nSeveral days after the travel ban went into effect -- and began to face lawsuits in federal court -- the White House counsel's office clarified that legal permanent residents were not covered by the executive order.\n\nRead More", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-02-23", "authors": "Laura Jarrett, CNN", "type": "article"}
