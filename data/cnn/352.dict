As a candidate, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslim immigration to the United States, and Justice Department lawyers have gone to great lengths to avoid calling it a \"travel ban\" in court, referring to it as a \"temporary pause\" or simply \"the executive order.\"\n\nIn a string of tweets, Trump reiterated comments he made in light of the London terror attacks that the travel ban was necessary.\n\n\"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN,\" he tweeted at 6:25 a.m. ET.\n\n\"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\" he added.", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": "Eugene Scott and Ariane de Vogue, CNN", "type": "article"}
