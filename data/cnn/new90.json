I thought it was all over.\u201d\n\nTajrostami said she hopes to study art in the U.S. and plans to join her husband in Dallas soon. He moved from Iran six months ago, has a green card and is working at a car dealership.\n\nSimilar scenes played out across the U.S. two days after a judge in Washington state suspended the president\u2019s travel ban and just hours after a federal appeals court denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to set aside the ruling.\n\nAs Trump Tightens Immigration, Canada Courts Talented U.S. Tech Workers\n\nThe U.S. canceled the visas of up to 60,000 foreigners in the week after the ban on travel from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen took effect, according to the State Department.

Then all of a sudden, it stopped, and I didn\u2019t even know if he\u2019d be allowed to come here. It\u2019s been a really tough week to figure out what will happen to us,\u201d said Azabadi, who has lived in the U.S. for 11 years and is now a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe couple are hoping to keep their wedding date of May 12.\n\n\u201cSeeing the support from the lawyers and different people trying to help, it was really nice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be the best and do the best for the people and for this country. We would love to have the opportunity.\u201d\n\nIranian researcher Nima Enayati, a Ph.D. candidate at a university in Milan, was prevented from boarding a flight to the U.S. on Jan. 30.

You sit in an airport day in and day out, and you see all these moments of great joy and unification,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so sad to see that and know some people weren\u2019t having that.
