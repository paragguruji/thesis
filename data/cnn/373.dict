Donald Trump went on a weird rant Thursday morning against MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski and her partner and co-host Joe Scarborough, calling her \"crazy,\" him \"psycho\" and saying he rejected both of them for an interview while Brzezinski was \"bleeding badly\" from a facelift.\n\nA lot of people, including top GOP lawmakers , found the tweets questionable at best, but Melania Trump and Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders both stood by them , with the first lady's spokesman saying the President \"will punch back 10 times harder\" when insulted.\n\nThe President and the MSNBC hosts obviously have a difficult relationship, but the flap comes at an especially inopportune time for the administration: After all, it's still trying to court GOP senators to get the health care bill passed\n\n2.

Germany\n\nGerman lawmakers voted by a wide margin to legalize same-sex marriage , a landmark decision that came just days after Chancellor Angela Merkel dropped her longstanding opposition to a free vote on the issue (she did, however, still vote \"no\"). The bill, which is also likely to be approved by Germany's upper house, allows same-sex couples to marry and jointly adopt children. Germany would become one of 20 or so countries where same-sex marriage is legal\n\nJUST WATCHED German lawmakers vote to legalize gay marriage Replay More Videos ...

Less than an hour before the ban was slated to start, Hawaii filed an emergency motion. Its issue? The part of the ban that defines a \"bona fide relationship\" that would allow people from six banned countries into the US. Under the current parameters, sons- and daughters-in-law and the betrothed are \"bona fide,\" but grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins aren't.\n\nJUST WATCHED What to expect with Trump's revised travel ban Replay More Videos ...

With fewer than 4 million births last year, the number of babies squealing from coast to coast is the lowest it's ever been, a government report finds. The drop hinges, at least in part, on another new record low -- in teen births. Those dropped 9% last year, compared with 2015. It continues a long-term trend that's seen the birth rate among teens drop 67% since 1991. No surprise: It's \"access ... and use of contraceptives that has really led to these kind of changes,\" one expert said. On the flip side, there's been an uptick in births to older moms , with 4% more babies born last year to women ages 40 to 44.\n\nJUST WATCHED Giving birth in the US is more dangerous than you think Replay More Videos ...
