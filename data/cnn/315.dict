He already has his track record of being very clearly anti-Muslim.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nDang said that even if the courts do not allow Trump's travel ban to go into effect, some of the damage has already been done because immigrant communities are now facing heightened discrimination and bullying.\n\n\"Whatever the President thinks is OK, or if they're a bully, it's going to be OK for (a child) to be a bully,\" Dang said. \"His bad behavior is definitely trickling down into the minds of children and it goes beyond just the few years that they're in middle school. It could stick with them for years to come.\"\n\nAnd now, Dang hopes to use her music to empower her community and promote unity.\n\nShe said that even before the 2016 election, the 2014 rise of the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement, which has been prominent in Baltimore, inspired her to write more song about \"rising up.\"\n\n\"For me, my writing is less about telling people what they should believe,\" she said, \"but more about telling my fans to 'get politically involved.'\"\n\nMy LAST SHOW at #SXSW tmrw, 3/17, 2 pm @ 1171 Graham St. https://t.co/0NUaDYYARs pic.twitter.com/fAuql1Sz6Z \u2014 Amrita (@amidang) March 16, 2017\n\nShe describes her music as \"East-meets-West, experimental avant-pop,\" which combines Eastern and Western music styles with electronic music production and is often deeply spiritual.\n\nAt the festival, she is set to perform a new song, \"Binaa Pyaar,\" which means \"Without Love\" in Punjabi.\n\n\"Definitely my background, my culture, the blend of my background and my culture and my upbringing has definitely a huge influence on my music,\" Dang said. \"That's undeniable for me.\"", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Deena Zaru, CNN", "type": "article"}
