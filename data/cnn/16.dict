He added that he would \"seek advisory council consensus\" and present ideas to Trump.\n\nPlease read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President. https://t.co/qLpbsP4lEk \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017\n\nSeveral tech executives have publicly denounced the travel ban.\n\nUber CEO Travis Kalanic called the ban \"unjust\" in a Facebook post on Sunday, and said his company would \"urge the government to reinstate the right of U.S. residents to travel.\"\n\nUber had earlier been criticized for what many saw as an inappropriate response to the ban.\n\nKalanick, who along with Musk is a member of another economic council giving advice to Trump, said he would use his position on the council to \"stand up for what's right.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase also weighed in on the ban Sunday. The company released a statement saying it has reached out to employees on sponsored visas who could be affected by the executive order.\n\n\"We want every one of you to know of our unwavering commitment to the dedicated people working here at JPMorgan Chase,\" the statement read.\n\nLike Kalanick and Musk, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is also on the president's business and economic council.", "section": "news", "source": "CNNMoney", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Jill Disis and Cristina Alesci", "type": "article"}
