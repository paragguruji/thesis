Watson granted the state's request to lift that hold on Wednesday in light of the new executive order.\n\n\"To be sure, the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one,\" Neal Katyal, one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii and former acting US solicitor general, explained in an interview with CNN. But in his view, the new travel ban still \"suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED US travel ban leaves LGBT refugees in limbo Replay More Videos ...

The government cited the significant changes to the new order, including the fact that it does not apply to green card holders or those with valid visas.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-03-07", "authors": "Laura Jarrett, CNN", "type": "article"}
