It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.\"\n\nI don't wake up every day looking for a way to sue Donald Trump. But we are 10 days in and I've filed three cases already. - Maura Healey (@maura_healey) January 31, 2017\n\nTrump appointed Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until the Senate confirms Senator Jeff Sessions. (\"He is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons,\" the White House statement added.) Boente was sworn in around 9 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nBoente is a 31-year veteran of the Justice Department. He oversaw the prosecution of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell (later overturned by the Supreme Court) as well as cases against U.S. Rep. William J. Jefferson and former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Andrew Nusca", "type": "article"}
