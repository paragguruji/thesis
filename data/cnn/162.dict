None of those twelve -- who are all American citizens or legal residents -- emigrated from or were born into a family that emigrated from a country that is the subject of the Trump administration's travel ban.\n\nIndeed, seven of the twelve terrorists are native-born U.S. citizens, hailing from cities such as Memphis and Arlington, Virginia, according to research by New America . And none of the 9/11 attackers came from any of the seven countries listed by Trump's executive order.\n\nNew America also found that three potentially serious attacks in the US since 9/11 that did not end up killing anyone were perpetrated by terrorists from countries that are covered by Trump's ban, two from Somalia and one from Iran.\n\nOf the almost 400 individuals accused of jihadist terrorism crimes since 9/11 in the United States -- ranging from crimes such as murder to less serious crimes such as sending small sums of money to a terrorist organization -- almost half are native-born American citizens, and more than 80 percent are US citizens or legal permanent residents.\n\nHalf of the deadly attackers in the US since 9/11 come from families that trace their origins either to the United States or to Pakistan, which is not included on Trump's travel ban list.\n\nRead More", "section": "opinions", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst, and David Sterman", "type": "article"}
