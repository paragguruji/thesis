A draft proposal of an executive order obtained by Bloomberg News reportedly shows that Trump is poised to suspend all entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nNotably missing from the blacklist, however, are several Muslim-majority countries where Trump has business dealings, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe news organization has put together a map of the proposed suspensions, with the Muslim-majority countries where Trump has business interests\u2014Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan\u2014rendered in yellow.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration ban excludes countries with business ties https://t.co/XEcwMJaKht pic.twitter.com/nRNNmXscMZ \u2014 Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) January 26, 2017\n\nWhile Muslim-majority countries such as Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and others are not included on the list, the omission of Turkey and Egypt may be argued as being seen at odds with Trump\u2019s definition.
