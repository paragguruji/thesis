Critics and rivals interpreted Uber's actions as a sign of support for Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, and a movement on Twitter\u2014 #DeleteUber \u2014then sprouted. Uber users were pushed to leave the ride-hailing service.\n\nRival car-hailing service Lyft, which seized the moment to pledge $1 million to the ACLU , overtook Uber in total App Store downloads on Sunday. Under pressure from angry users, Kalanick then left Donald Trump's business advisory council Thursday, just a day before the group was scheduled to meet with the president .\n\nStill, 200,000 is a mere fraction of Uber's total numbers. In October, Kalanick said the app had roughly 40 million monthly active users. The deleted accounts would amount to just 0.5% of that total. And that percentage could be even lower, if Uber has since added users or a portion of the deletions came from inactive users.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Lucinda Shen", "type": "article"}
