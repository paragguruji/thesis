But it seems that refugees weren\u2019t the only ones negatively affected by the immigration ban; Sage Steele missed her flight to Houston.\n\nOn Monday, the ESPN anchor posted a lengthy Instagram post describing her experience getting to Los Angeles International Airport. \u201cThousands of us dragged luggage nearly 2 miles to get to LAX, but still missed our flights,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston won\u2019t affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights.\u201d Steele added that \u201cimmigrants were affected as well.\u201d\n\nThe post was seen by many on social media as being tone-deaf to the disruption in the lives of the refugees who had been indefinitely detained at airports around the country. \u201cSome things are bigger than [you],\u201d wrote one user.\n\nhey Sage..w/ all due respect..what types of protest do you prefer? The 'disruption' is the point of protest. \u2014 Taylor Rooks (@TaylorRooks) January 30, 2017\n\nAs a volunteer attorney who helped reunite a family this past weekend your comments are stunning.

Unless, of course, only YOUR opinion is allowed\ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/iiZXuD4Ne2 \u2014 Sage Steele (@sagesteele) January 30, 2017\n\nThe executive order that was issued Friday suspended the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked U.S. entry for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries for at least 90 days. Over the weekend, more than a dozen petitions on behalf of individuals being held at airports were filed.
