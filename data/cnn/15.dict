He assured workers that Apple does not support Trump's policy and the company is prepared to lend them aid.\n\n\"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,\" Cook said.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle sent out a memo to its employees urging anyone with a visa or green card from one of the banned countries to cancel any travel plans.\n\n\"Please do not travel outside of the U.S. until the ban is lifted. While the entry restriction is currently only in place for 90 days, it could be extended with little or no warning,\" the memo, which was reviewed by CNN, reads.\n\nMicrosoft executive Brad Smith\n\nMicrosoft said it employs 76 people that could be affected by the ban. Smith said in an email to employees, which was shared by Nadella on LinkedIn, that it will provide \"legal advice and assistance\" to those affected.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey\n\nDorsey called the potential impact of Trump's decision \"real and upsetting.\"\n\nThe Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting.
