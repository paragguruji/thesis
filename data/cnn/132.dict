When they land, they will be taken into a secondary screening process in which they will be interviewed and their biometric and biographic information will be checked to see if there are any red flags. Then their eligibility to enter the country will be determined.\n\nThe countries targeted by Trump's executive order include the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nGreen card holders already overseas seeking to return to their homes in the US will be processed through a waiver authority that has already been established.\n\nOne official said there is a case-by-case admissions process and another said it is being done \"expeditiously.\"", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Pamela Brown and Eli Watkins, CNN", "type": "article"}
