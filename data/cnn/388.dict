In recent days CNN has heard from people seeking refuge from war, wives trying to return to their husbands, parents hoping to attend their child\u2019s graduation in the US and many more. Here are their stories.\n\nEditor's Note: CNN also spoke with supporters of Trump's travel ban, read their stories here.\n\nLaura McDermott for CNN Nashwa Alhoussaini 21, Syria\n\nNashwa Alhoussaini is originally from Damascus, Syria. She was at a protest at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Sunday, January 29. \"I have a lot of family that lives overseas,\" she said. \"I actually have one family member that is trying to get his fiancee over here and we were gonna have her wedding next month, but it's officially been canceled.\"\n\nMary Ann Carter for CNN Babak Seradjeh 39, Iran\n\nSeradjeh is an associate professor of physics at Indiana University. He was born in Tehran, spent eight years in Canada and currently lives in Bloomington, Indiana. He has dual citizenship -- Iran and Canada. Seradjeh was planning to fly to Tel Aviv on Saturday to meet with his research partner, Eytan Grosfeld, a professor at Ben-Gurion University.\n\n\u201cI flew to Newark for my connection, but with all the news of people -- including green card holders and dual nationals -- being turned away, I decided not to take the rest of my trip. I've been rerouted to go back to Indy\u2026 This effectively suspends my research trip until further notice. This research is funded partly through the National Science Foundation. It is unclear to me how or when I can take this trip or what other effects the executive order will have on my work.\u201d\n\nShiho Fukada for CNN Raya Bidshahri 21, Iran\n\nA student at Boston University, Bidshahri has lived in the United States for three years and considers Boston her home. She fears she will have to leave the country when she graduates in May and her student visa expires.\n\nBidshahri is studying neuroscience and says the university has warned her not to leave the country because she might not be able to re-enter. Her family was planning to attend her graduation, but because they are Iranian they\u2019re now covered by the ban.\n\n\u201cAbove all, it\u2019s heartbreaking. My family and I have always dreamed of coming to the United States and accomplishing our dreams here. My family put in all of their investments and financial resources to allow me to come here and make things happen. We are treated like we\u2019re terrorists, as if we want to cause trouble when above all we just want to make the United States a better place -- contributing whether it\u2019s through research, studying, or entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nGabriella Demczuk for CNN Said Hajouli Syria\n\nHajouli is a trainee doctor from Aleppo who has lived in the US for about two years. He and his wife both fled Syria after the civil war broke out. His wife has been living in Turkey and he has not seen her in almost two years. Hajouli said his wife was recently granted a J2 visa and flew Saturday from Istanbul to Dulles International Airport outside Washington. She was being detained at the airport and had not yet seen a lawyer. Hajouli said he feels more hopeful after a federal judge granted an emergency stay for citizens of the affected countries who have already arrived in the US.\n\nShiho Fukada for CNN Zainab Abdo 21, Syria\n\nAbdo came to the U.S. seven months ago and is living in Lowell, Massachusetts. She\u2019s learning English and eventually wants to study nursing. Abdo is working the overnight shift at Walmart to help make ends meet, but doesn\u2019t have a green card yet. Speaking through an interpreter, she said she\u2019s scared about what that means for her future.\n\n\u201cI have family back home in Syria and in Turkey. A lot of people have lost hope.\u201d\n\nGabriella Demczuk for CNN Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa Syria\n\nMoustafa is a trainee doctor at a hospital in Washington, D.C. Like his friend Hajouli, he was raised in Aleppo and left Syria soon after the civil war started. He is in the US on a cultural exchange visa along with his wife, who had been visiting family in Qatar. She arrived back at Dulles airport early Saturday morning, but Trump\u2019s executive order was signed while she was in the air. Because she has a Syrian passport, she was sent back several hours later, he said. Moustafa is devastated and is wishing the New York judge\u2019s emergency stay had come earlier in the day. But he said the crowds at Dulles chanting \"Refugees are welcome here\" have given him hope.\n\nFrannie Fabian for CNN Hesham Al Madwami 37, Yemen\n\nHesham Al Madwami and his wife, Frannie, live in Clarkston, Georgia.\n\n\u201cI am from the capital of Yemen (Sana'a). I waited four years before I got a visa to come to the US and marry my wife. After I got to America, a terrible war started in Yemen. I am always thinking about my family and my country, counting down the days until this war ends. I thought all I wanted was for the airstrikes to end and the airport to open in Sana'a, so me and my wife could visit my family. Now this new executive order would mean that if I left the country to visit my family, I would not be allowed to return to Georgia where I live now with my wife, even though I am a legal permanent resident. I am so upset.\u201d\n\nMark Kauzlarich for CNN Mohamad Zandian 26, Iran\n\nZandian is a doctoral student in biochemistry at Ohio State University. His wife Parisa was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\n\u201c[My wife] was not feeling very well at the beginning [of being detained], but we will get through this. I came here thinking that here I will have a life like a dream, but it didn\u2019t sort out very well. I didn\u2019t think this would happen but now that it\u2019s happened, I\u2019m just thinking about somewhere else. If I\u2019m going to be an imprisoned person, I\u2019d rather be imprisoned back home.\u201d\n\nMark Kauzlarich for CNN Hameed Khalid Darweesh 53, Iraq\n\nDarweesh was one of two Iraqis detained at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport after the travel ban was announced. Darweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US military during the Iraq War, was released from detention Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d\n\nFrom Twitter Hadi Alhassani 51, Yemen\n\nAlhassani lives in Saudi Arabia and works for an international company that does business with the US. He earned a master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Kansas, has a visa and travels to the US frequently for business meetings. Alhassani, the father of five children, was planning on traveling to Washington, D.C. in early March for a trade show.\n\n\"I was actually planning to send my kids to school in the US, but no more,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m looking at New Zealand.\"\n\nShiho Fukada for CNN Rafal Thaher 23, Iraq\n\nThaher came to the US five years ago. She didn\u2019t speak a word of English when she arrived, but Lowell, Massachusetts, has become home to her. She works at CVS as a supervisor and is studying business at Middlesex Community College. Her brother and his family are still in Iraq, where he works with a company that protects US military personnel.\n\n\u201cI applied for his visa, but he is going to be affected (by this travel ban). We were trying to bring him and his family over here.\u201d\n\nMelissa Golden/Redux for CNN Belal Rajab 24, Syria\n\nIn the yard outside the apartment where Rajab lives in Stone Mountain, Georgia, there's a sign with balloons on it that says \"Welcome Home!\" But Rajab is still struggling to find his footing in the United States. The 24-year-old refugee from Homs, Syria, arrived last month with just three changes of clothing to his name. In a matter of minutes last week, he went from thinking his family could be days away from joining him to fearing they'll never be allowed to come.\n\nThis is the first time he's ever been apart from his mother. He keeps a picture of her inside his wallet, next to his ID. He's not sure when they will see each other again.\n\n\"It's very painful to be away from them. My happiness is not complete because my family is not with me. I have no one to talk to. I have a neighbor but it's not enough. ... I hope when I get a job it will help distract me.\"\n\nMelissa Golden/Redux for CNN Habiba Mohamed and Abdalla Munye Somalia\n\nMohamed, 38, and Munye, 44, arrived in the United States just two days before Trump's inauguration.\n\nTheir 20-year-old daughter, Batula Ramadan, was supposed to join them in Clarkston, Georgia. But the Somalian refugees were devastated to learn that their daughter's trip was canceled because of Trump's executive order. They said they hoped the first lady could convince her husband to change his mind.\n\n\"My daughter right now is in a lot of pain. She's unable to express herself because of how much she's crying,\" Mohamed said. \"I'm afraid she feels I abandoned her.\"", "section": "politics", "type": "Article", "title": "These are the faces of Trump's ban"}
