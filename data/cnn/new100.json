Amazon, Expedia were witnesses in original suit. https://t.co/wv8LAH3OnG \u2014 David Zapolsky (@DavidZapolsky) February 6, 2017\n\nWhile it is not unusual to see companies\u2019 lawyers talk about cases on social media, Zapolsky\u2019s comment is notable given the political nature of the case, because Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have sparred in the past\u2014most notably when Trump suggested an antitrust suit against Amazon.\n\nTrump has also taken repeated shots at The Washington Post, a newspaper owned by Bezos that has criticized some of his decisions.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2018s technology newsletter.\n\nIn the wake of the 9th Circuit ruling, Trump has so far not attacked the companies that supported the legal challenge by Washington state. Instead, the President responded on Twitter with an all caps tweet that he would see the judges \u201cin court,\u201d prompting some humorous replies.\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \u2014 Donald J.
