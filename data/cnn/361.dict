The government has asked the court to make the ruling take effect immediately with a mandate, which would allow that part of the executive order to proceed.\n\nAdministration lawyers are still reviewing the court's decision, Kelly said, but he called it a \"big win.\"\n\n\"If my lawyers knock on the door, tap on the door and say, 'We got it boss. We won on this one,' and that we can start doing what we started to months ago, then we're off to the races,\" Kelly said. \"So I think, if it's true and I'm allowed to do it, this is a good thing for security of the United States.\"\n\nRead More", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-06-15", "authors": "Tal Kopan, CNN", "type": "article"}
