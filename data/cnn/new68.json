Executives from Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft , Airbnb, Lyft, Twitter, and Uber all voiced objections to Trump\u2019s Friday order, which left refugees, legal residents, and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries stranded in American airports over the weekend and set off protests in major cities nationwide.\n\nGoogle and Lyft announced seven-figure contributions to the ACLU; Uber pledged to compensate drivers left stranded by the ban; and Airbnb offered free housing to refugees. And some of the industry\u2019s representatives in Washington lodged criticism as well, with TechNet and the Internet Association expressing opposition.\n\nTens of Thousands in U.S. Cities Protest Trump Immigration Order 1 of 31 Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Silicon Valley would emerge as the first corporate hub of dissent, considering both the liberal bent of the industry\u2019s workforce and its reliance on foreign-born talent. Less clear is how many non-tech companies with sprawling global operations will join the chorus.\n\nGoldman Sachs, which counts several alumni among the tops ranks of the new administration, may have been the first. In a voicemail to the bank\u2019s employees on Sunday night, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the executive order is \u201cnot a policy we support.\u201d And General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said in a Sunday blog post he shares his employees\u2019 \u201cconcern\u201d over the ban. They\u2019ve since been joined by Ford\u2019s Mark Fields (but not execs from Fiat or GM) who sent out a staff memo stressing commitment to diversity, along with Morgan Stanley\u2019s James Gorman, JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, and Starbucks Howard Schultz. But the more common reaction among major non-tech companies has been silence.\n\nAlong with two Fortune colleagues, I reached out over the weekend to nearly every company in the Fortune 100 for a response. To the extent we heard back, the responses were almost uniformly no-comments or punts, with spokespeople explaining executives were still assessing the impacts of the ban. Appearing on Bloomberg TV this morning, former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said it\u2019s \u201can extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out, when the president\u2019s been in office for one week.\u201d We\u2019re following up today with companies likely affected by the order and will be updating our coverage accordingly.", "authors": ["Tory Newmyer"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "silent", "companies", "weekend", "trump", "ban", "refugees", "stranded", "nontech", "trumps", "uber", "order", "presidents", "administration"], "summary": "An uneasy truce that\u2019s presided between big business and the Trump administration showed its first cracks over the weekend, as the tech industry in particular registered its disapproval of the president\u2019s immigration ban.\nGoogle and Lyft announced seven-figure contributions to the ACLU; Uber pledged to compensate drivers left stranded by the ban; and Airbnb offered free housing to refugees.\nLess clear is how many non-tech companies with sprawling global operations will join the chorus.\nBut the more common reaction among major non-tech companies has been silence.\nTo the extent we heard back, the responses were almost uniformly no-comments or punts, with spokespeople explaining executives were still assessing the impacts of the ban."}
