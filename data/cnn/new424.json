Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg met with him earlier this month and said he and Trump had made progress on the Air Force One issue and the potential sale of fighter aircraft. Representatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford declined to comment on Trump\u2019s immigration curbs.\n\nWall Street, meanwhile, is hoping the new administration will ease some of the regulations introduced in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis and adopt a lighter touch in their enforcement.\n\nIndustries including banking, healthcare and auto manufacturing \u201csee themselves on the cusp of a new era of deregulation, and they do not want to do anything that would offend the new emperor,\u201d said Cornelius Hurley, director of Boston University\u2019s Center for Finance, Law & Policy.\n\nTrump had targeted both the tech industry and Wall Street during his presidential campaign, but once elected, he tapped former investment bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity investors to join his administration \u2013 most notably Goldman Sachs\u2019s long-time chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who will now head the National Economics Council.\n\nWith friends in high places, Wall Street may have less reason to be as outspoken about the new restrictions.\n\n\u201cBankers have direct access to this White House,\u201d said Erik Gordon, who teaches at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to protest publicly.\u201d Representatives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nWells Fargo & Co said in a statement that it was reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and its business. JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s Operating Committee, which includes CEO Jamie Dimon, sent a note to staff saying it was reaching out to all employees affected and noted that the country was, \u201cstrengthened by the rich diversity of the world around us.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, some CEOs were more outspoken. Nike Inc CEO Mark Parker said the company did not support the executive order.\n\n\u201cNike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThose values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S. banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries.\u201d\n\nIn more pragmatic vein, Brent Saunders, CEO of U.S. drugmaker Allergan, tweeted: \u201cOppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability to attract the best & diverse talent.\u201d\n\nBut many boardrooms kept quiet. Representatives for some energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp, for example, declined to comment.\n\nAs the idea of corporate social responsibility has taken root, so companies have increasingly championed a range of causes, including gay rights, diverse workplaces and a global view.\n\nMany in corporate America are still trying to work out how to deal with a new government that takes a more conservative stance on some social issues and has an anti-globalisation platform.\n\nThose non-tech companies that did issue statements over the weekend tended to emphasize their role as good corporate citizens rather than openly criticize Trump\u2019s policies. Starbucks Corp CEO Howard Schultz has put the coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers\n\nnot to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race\n\nrelations.\n\nIn a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of countries, but he did not directly criticize Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cI am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his statement, General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt told staff that the company would engage with the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of this issue to GE and to the business community overall,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOne of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next week.\n\nOf the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who founded Tesla Motors Inc and SpaceX, and Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc, have spoken out against Trump\u2019s immigration curbs.\n\nA spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone Group LP whom Trump tasked to set up and chair the panel, declined to comment.", "authors": ["Fortune Editors"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["executive", "comment", "trump", "ban", "immigration", "corporate", "valley", "order", "outside", "outcry", "trumps", "ceo", "declined", "staff", "silicon"], "summary": "Most U.S. corporate bosses have stayed silent on President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration curbs, underscoring the sensitivities around opposing policies that could provoke a backlash from the White House.\nTens of Thousands in U.S. Cities Protest Trump Immigration Order 1 of 31 AdvertisementBefore office, Trump attacked Boeing over the cost of the future Air Force One program.\nRepresentatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford declined to comment on Trump\u2019s immigration curbs.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to protest publicly.\u201d Representatives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Trump\u2019s immigration order.\nWells Fargo & Co said in a statement that it was reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and its business."}
