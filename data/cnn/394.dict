Gerry Connolly and Don Beyer of Virginia, and John Delaney and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, all Democrats, were struck with frustration upon finding they wouldn't have access to an official from the agency or be able to visit the detainment facilities at Dulles. Two of the congressmen currently sit on the Congressional Oversight Committee.\n\nConnolly told reporters they'd intended to sit down with CBP officials to \"get some answers to some questions\" but were denied.\n\n\"Is that really an unreasonable request?\" Connolly asked.", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "David Siegel, CNN", "type": "article"}
