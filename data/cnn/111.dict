Mark Peterson\u2014Redux Pictures\n\nIn the heated, high-stakes global war for talent, January 27 may go down as the day America shot itself in the foot.\n\nThat\u2019s when, late on a Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump casually dropped his executive order, effectively barring the citizens of seven countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days . Courts quickly blocked the ban, and a subsequent presidential order, issued earlier this month, is less sweeping . But the logistical chaos and angry debate that ensued have created unease worldwide. And perhaps nowhere is it felt more intensely than in America\u2019s universities, which collectively host more than a million foreign students\u2014some 17,000 from the seven affected countries.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s travel ban is limited and temporary\u2014and the fate of the order remains unclear\u2014many fear the impact on American higher education, arguably the US\u2019s most prestigious export, will be lasting and severe.\n\nAmerica\u2019s universities have long been bastions of globalism. Diversity is celebrated as a means to foster robust academic debate, prepare students for a global economy, and spread American values throughout the world. In an effort to draw the best and brightest, U.S. institutions have raced to send students abroad and open up global outposts as ideologically and geographically far-flung as Beijing (Columbia) and Abu Dhabi (NYU). They\u2019ve also rapidly increased international enrollment; the number of foreign students attending US institutions has swelled 73% over the past decade.\n\nThe benefits are not strictly philosophical. Foreign students typically pay full freight at American colleges, subsidizing their US counterparts who receive financial aid or tuition discounts. (While 5% of U.S. university-goers are from overseas, the group accounts for 8-10% of the system\u2019s revenues.)\n\nNicolas Rapp\n\nIn November, less than a week after the election, Moody\u2019s Investor Service sounded the alarm on that trend when it declared America\u2019s rapidly growing population of international students \u201ca potentially volatile revenue stream.\u201d Universities, it warned, were increasingly exposed to changes in government policy. And relevant policy, it noted, could change under Trump.\n\nCollege officials acknowledge foreign students are a piece of the financial equation, but they\u2019re reluctant to speak of their value\u2014or the implication of Trump\u2019s actions\u2014in such terms. The Association of International Educators, or NAFSA, says the nation\u2019s million-plus international students add $32.7 billion and 400,000 some jobs to the US annually.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell whether an America-first administration will steer wary international students to competing countries. (The UK, another top destination, has its own self-inflicted wounds post-Brexit.) But there\u2019s plenty of anecdotal evidence that Canada, which made attracting international students part of its national economic strategy in 2014, is likely to gain.\n\nThe country\u2019s universities have been flooded with inquiries since the U.S. election, from American and international students alike, says Paul Davidson, President of Universities Canada, the nation\u2019s leading higher education association.\n\nFor more on the travel ban, watch this Fortune video:\n\nCanada, which in the wake of the travel ban has both offered neighborly assistance \u2014affected students are welcome to relocate there and continue their studies with U.S. institutions via Skype\u2014and stepped up its game\u2014extending deadlines, waiving application fees, and in some cases offering tuition breaks to certain foreign students\u2014has plenty of capacity to welcome everyone, Davidson says.\n\nA version of this article appears in the March 15, 2017 issue of Fortune.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "authors": "Erika Fry", "type": "article"}
