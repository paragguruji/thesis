The order also barred resettlement of refugees for 120 days and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cIt discriminates against people because of their religion, it discriminates against people because of their country of origin,\u201d Healey said at a Boston press conference, flanked by leaders from the tech, healthcare and education sectors who said that the order could limit their ability to attract and retain highly educated workers.\n\nMassachusetts will be backing a lawsuit filed over the weekend in Boston federal court by two Iranian men who teach at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. A federal judge blocked the government from expelling those men from the country and halted enforcement of the order for seven days, following similar but more limited moves in four other states.\n\nThe attorneys general of New York and Virginia also said their states were joining similar lawsuits filed in their respective federal courts challenging the ban.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to Virginia,\u201d Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told reporters. \u201cThis is not an action I take lightly, but it is one I take with confidence in our legal analysis.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, liberal-leaning Washington state became the first U.S. state to have its attorney general initiate a lawsuit against Trump to challenge the travel ban.\n\nMultiple foreign nationals have also filed lawsuits challenging the ban. They included one filed in Colorado on Tuesday by a Libyan college student and two filed in Chicago, including one on behalf of an Iranian father of three children all living in Illinois.\n\nProtests against Trump\u2019s executive action continued on Tuesday in several cities.\n\nA crowd of several thousand demonstrators gathered at the federal courthouse in Minneapolis, chanting \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho Muslim ban has got to go!\u201d Dozens of protesters chanted the same slogan at Los Angeles International Airport, and more than 400 demonstrators gathered in downtown Miami to protest both the travel ban and Trump\u2019s crackdown on sanctuary cities.\n\nSanctuary challenge\n\nSan Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed suit over Trump\u2019s order threatening to cut funds to cities with sanctuary policies, a move that could stop the flow of billions of dollars to major U.S. population centers including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to be implemented, this executive order would make our communities less safe. It would make our residents less prosperous, and it would split families apart,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nSanctuary cities adopt policies that limit cooperation, such as refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Advocates of the policies say that, beyond helping police with crime reporting, they make undocumented immigrants more willing to serve as witnesses if they do not fear that contact with law enforcement will lead to their deportation.\n\nBoth the San Francisco and Massachusetts actions contend that Trump\u2019s orders in question violate the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states.\n\nMichael Hethmon, senior counsel with the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, called the San Francisco lawsuit a \u201csilly political gesture,\u201d noting that prior federal court decisions make clear that the U.S. government \u201ccan prohibit a policy that essentially impedes legitimate federal programs.\u201d", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "trump", "policies", "challenge", "immigration", "court", "order", "trumps", "federal", "filed", "states", "virginia"], "summary": "Legal challenges to President Donald Trump\u2019s first moves on immigration spread on Tuesday, with three states suing over his executive order banning travel into the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.\nFor more on the immigration executive order, watch:Both policies are in line with campaign promises by Republican businessman-turned-politician Trump, who vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and to take hard-line steps to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\u201cAs we speak, there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to Virginia,\u201d Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told reporters.\nProtests against Trump\u2019s executive action continued on Tuesday in several cities.\n\u201cIf allowed to be implemented, this executive order would make our communities less safe."}
