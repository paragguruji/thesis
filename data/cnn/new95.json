Because the hearing is taking place by telephone, the stream will be audio-only.\n\nIf you want to listen to State of Washington & State of Minnesota v. Trump, simply go to this link provided by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe 9th Circuit, which is more tech-friendly than most of its sister courts including the Supreme Court, has also put up a webpage with all the documents in the case.\n\nThese documents include a much-publicized amicus (aka \u201cfriend of the court\u201d) brief, which opposes the travel ban, by nearly 100 tech companies including Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL). Yesterday, a group of other companies\u2014including Tesla (TSLA), ClassPass and Pandora (P) \u2014also signed on to the brief.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen? It\u2019s important to note the 9th Circuit hearing is not about whether or not Trump\u2019s order is unconstitutional. Instead, it is about whether to maintain a temporary block on Trump\u2019s order while courts take a closer look at the constitutional question.\n\nThe temporary block went into place last week after U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle sided with two states over the Justice Department. This led to a fresh controversy after President Trump disparaged Robart as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d Robart is a Republican appointed by George W. Bush, and received unanimous confirmation by the Senate.\n\nThe 9th Circuit is likely to rule later this week. Most legal scholars expect the appeal court to uphold the temporary block, teeing the case up for the Supreme Court.\n\nHere is an explanation of how the case can land before the Supreme Court, and what might happen next.", "authors": ["Jeff John Roberts"], "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "hear", "trump", "ban", "circuit", "appeal", "supreme", "block", "9th", "court", "order", "trumps", "livestream", "temporary", "hearing", "robart"], "summary": "If you want to listen to State of Washington & State of Minnesota v.
