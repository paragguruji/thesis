That's a crisis. You can imagine the stress.\"\n\nCook continued to say that if no one speaks out against it, it's \"as if we're agreeing, that we become a part of it. It's important to speak out.\"\n\nCook isn\u2019t the only tech CEO who\u2019s spoken out against the ban. The executive order, which prohibits immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for at least 90 days, and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely, has caused an outcry from Silicon Valley chiefs \u2014namely from Google ( goog ) , Facebook ( fb ) , Lyft, and Uber, and of course, Apple.", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Madeline Farber", "type": "article"}
