He is the author of \" United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists .\"\n\n(CNN) The White House's list of 78 \"major terrorist attacks targeting the West\" is strikingly devoid of evidence to support President Trump's halt to immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nConspicuous by their absence on the White House list of terrorists carrying out major attacks against Western targets were Iraqis, Somalis, Sudanese and Yemenis, who are from four of the seven Muslim countries that the Trump administration is seeking to suspend travel from. (Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said there were no Libyans on the White House list of attackers. This article has been updated to reflect the omission.)\n\nInstead, the incidents listed on the White House terrorism list identified France, the United States and Belgium as the countries supplying the most anti-Western terrorists.\n\nWith great fanfare on Monday the White House released a list of 78 terrorist attacks since September 2014. A White House official described them as \"major terrorist attacks targeting the West.\"\n\nThe list was released after President Trump's claim that the media is under-covering terrorist attacks, a contention that is not borne out by the evidence.\n\nThe White House's own terrorism list underlines the arbitrary nature of the travel ban because, by the White House's own account, the countries that are generating the most significant number of terrorists threatening the West are in the West.\n\nThe list also underlines the fact that it is American citizens who largely foment terrorism in the United States. This is also the case in countries such as France and Belgium, where it is French and Belgian citizens who are often the ones conducting significant acts of terrorism.\n\nOf the total of 90 terrorists on the White House list, at most nine are from travel ban countries.\n\nIndeed, 50 of the terrorists \u2014 more than half -- are from Christian-majority countries in the West.\n\nOn the list, which includes the identities of attackers where they are known, France leads the way with 16 French terrorists, followed by the United States with 13 American terrorists, 11 of whom are US citizens and two of whom are legal permanent residents.\n\nOf these 29 American and French terrorists, only two even have family origins in travel ban countries and they are both from Somalia.\n\nBelgium comes in third place with seven terrorists.\n\nIn descending order after that are:\n\n--Tunisians (6),\n\n--Libyans and Bengalis are tied with 5,\n\n--Saudis (4),\n\n--Syrians, Algerians and Indonesians are tied with 3 each;\n\n--Afghans, Australians, Bosnians, Canadians, Danes, Germans, Russians and Turks are tied with two each and\n\n--One each from Chad, Egypt, the Emirates, Iran, Morocco, the Palestinian Territories, Pakistan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThese findings may cause a problem for the White House as it makes the argument that citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen are particularly likely to foment anti-Western terrorism, when the White House's own terrorism list demonstrates that this is not the case.\n\nFor example, an unspecified number of Filipinos participated in a botched attempt to blow up a bomb outside the US embassy in Manila last year.\n\nIn 15 of the 78 attacks the perpetrators have not been identified.\n\nI took the White House terrorism list and grouped it by nationalities below. The countries with the largest number of identified terrorists are at the beginning, while attacks where the perpetrator was not identified are listed at the end.
