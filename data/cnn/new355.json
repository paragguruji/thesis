MSM is working hard to sell it,\" Trump tweeted, taking a comment made by Khan out of context.\n\nAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\"\n\nPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\n\n\"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN,\" Trump said, undercutting White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said earlier this year in that calling his plan a travel ban \"misrepresents what it is.\"\n\nTweets as policy\n\nTrump's tweets are the most accurate representation of his administration's view, given they usually come directly from the President himself.\n\nAnd all of these tweets, taken as the presidential pronouncements that they are, have entirely overshadowed the Trump administration's attempt to push for infrastructure reform.\n\n\"We are very confident that through a $200 billion federal government expenditure, and that is over and above all normal infrastructure spending, this is in addition to, that that can equal well over $1 trillion of infrastructure investment in this country,\" Reed Cornish, a top White House aide, told reporters about the plan as most major outlets covered Trump's tweets.\n\nThis puts aides in a tough position. While they want to push policy reforms, like they did over the weekend, they almost always find themselves getting distracted by 140-character messages from the President himself.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aides have said that during the campaign they would regularly wake up in the morning in fear of what their boss, then a candidate for president, would have tweeted in the wee hours of the morning. Some of that fear abated, these aides said, when Trump entered the White House. But Monday morning's series of messages shows Trump will rarely, if ever, break his Twitter habit.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump pushes travel ban in tweetstorm Replay More Videos ...

It's not policy ... It's not policy, it's not an executive order. It's social media. Please understand the difference.\"\n\nBut Trump could, if he wanted to, tweet about infrastructure and follow the lead of his top aides.\n\nInstead, though, the President sent six tweets on Monday morning about the mayor of London, his travel ban and his Justice Department.\n\nNot one of Trump's messages mentioned infrastructure.", "authors": ["Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "source": "cnn", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "tweets", "ban", "aides", "president", "trumps", "step", "infrastructure", "messaging", "white", "policy"], "summary": "Tweets as policyTrump's tweets are the most accurate representation of his administration's view, given they usually come directly from the President himself.\nJUST WATCHED Trump pushes travel ban in tweetstorm Replay More Videos ...
