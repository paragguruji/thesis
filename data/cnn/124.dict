We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\"\n\nTrump's order will also cancel the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which once allowed repeat travelers to the United States to be able to forgo an in-person interview to renew their visa. Under the new order, these travelers will now have to have in-person interviews.\n\nAt the Pentagon, Trump met privately for about an hour with Mattis, Vice President Mike Pence, Security Adviser Mike Flynn and military officials and they discussed accelerating the defeat of ISIS, confronting global threats like North Korea, military readiness and the National Guard, a Defense official told CNN. The meeting took place in \"the tank,\" secure room where the Joint Chiefs meet.\n\nTrump also signed a second executive action on Friday that would spur military spending and, as Trump said, \"begin the great rebuilding of the Armed Services of the United States.\"\n\nThe President added that the executive action instructs Mattis to begin \"developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform.\"\n\nTrump's order on refugees has been something the White House has been considering for days and the President was seen with the document on his Air Force One desk Thursday when he flew to Philadelphia.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan praised Trump's orders on Friday.\n\n\"Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it's time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process,\" Ryan said in a statement, adding, \"President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\"\n\nPrioritizing Christians over Muslims\n\nJUST WATCHED Khizr Khan on Trump's refugee ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Khizr Khan on Trump's refugee ban 03:23\n\nBy signing the measures, Trump is making good on his promise to block Syrian and certain other refugees from entering the United States and his murkier pledge of banning Muslim immigration into the United States, a vow that his aides have walked back as being directed at countries seen as terror hotbeds.\n\nThe order also gave the Department of Homeland Security leeway to prioritize refugee claims made by people \"on the basis of religious based persecution\" as long as the person applying for refugee status is \"a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\n\nThis would make it easier for Christians and other religious minorities in majority Muslim countries from entering the United States than it would for Muslims in general.\n\nTrump did not back away from the idea that he is prioritizing Christians over Muslims in an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network taped before he signed the measures on Friday.\n\n\"We are going to help them,\" Trump said about persecuted Christians. \"They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.\"\n\nTrump did not cite a reason or offer any evidence about why the agencies that vet refugees, including the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, would have prioritized Muslim refugees over Christians.\n\n'This is a Muslim ban'\n\nDemocrats blasted Trump's move -- even before they saw the text of the documents -- arguing that while it may not ban all Muslims from entering the United States, it still is discriminatory.\n\n\"Make no mistake -- this is a Muslim ban,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, said in a statement.\n\n\"Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"Taking in immigrants and refugees is not only humanitarian but has also boosted our economy and created jobs decade after decade. This is one of the most backward and nasty executive orders that the president has issued.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED McCaul: Trump to freeze Syrian refugee program Replay More Videos ...

Masri said in a statement. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of days persons from the banned countries would be barred from entering the US.", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "authors": "Dan Merica, CNN", "type": "article"}
