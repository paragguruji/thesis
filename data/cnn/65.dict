Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, U.S., January 29, 2017. Tens of thousands of people rallied in U.S. cities and at airports on Sunday to voice outrage over President Trump's executive order restricting entry into the country for travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTens of thousands of people rallied in U.S. cities and at airports on Sunday to voice outrage over President Donald Trump's executive order restricting entry into the country for travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nIn New York, Washington and Boston, a second wave of demonstrations followed spontaneous rallies that broke out at U.S. airports on Saturday as U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began enforcing Trump's directive. The protests spread westward as the day progressed.\n\nThe order, which bars admission of Syrian refugees and suspends travel to the United States from Syria, Iraq, Iran and four other countries on national security grounds, has led to the detention or deportation of hundreds of people arriving at U.S. airports.\n\nUber Responds to Rage over Alleged 'Strikebreaking' During Immigration Protests\n\nOne of the largest of Sunday's protests took place at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, within sight of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, long a symbol of welcome to U.S. shores.\n\nDemocratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York told the crowd that Trump's order was un-American and ran counter to the country's core values.\n\n\"What we are talking about here is life and death for so many people,\" the Senate Democratic leader said. \"I will not rest until these horrible orders are repealed.\"\n\nThe march, estimated to have grown to about 10,000 people, later began heading to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Lower Manhattan.\n\nThese Countries with Business Links to Trump Aren't Part of His Immigration Ban\n\nIn Washington, thousands rallied at Lafayette Square across from the White House, chanting: \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here.\"\n\nIt was the second straight weekend that Washington was the scene of protests. Last Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women participated in an anti-Trump rally and march, one of dozens staged across the country.\n\nOn Sunday, many of the protesters left the White House area and marched along Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping at the Trump International Hotel where they shouted: \"Shame, shame, shame.\"\n\nA crowd that police estimated at 8,000 people eventually arrived at the steps of the U.S. Capitol, where a line of uniformed officers stood guard.\n\nFor more on the protests, watch:\n\nAs the crowd passed the Canadian Embassy en route to the Capitol, protesters chanted: \"Hey hey, ho ho, I wish our leader was Trudeau.\" It was a reference to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Saturday Twitter message affirming his country's welcoming policy toward refugees.\n\nTrump defended the executive order in a statement on Sunday, saying the United States would resume issuing visas to all countries once secure policies were put in place over the next 90 days.\n\n\"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" Trump said. \"This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\"\n\n'NEVER AGAIN MEANS NEVER'\n\nAria Grabowski, 30, of Washington, was carrying a sign that read: \"Never again means never again for everyone.\"\n\nStarbucks CEO Wants to Hire 10,000 Refugees\n\nAbove the slogan was a photograph of Jewish refugees who fled Germany in 1939 on a ship that was turned away from Havana, Cuba, and forced to return to Europe. More than 250 people aboard the ship were eventually killed by the Nazis.\n\nAbout 200 protesters chanted on Sunday afternoon at Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia near the U.S. capital.\n\nAbout the same number gathered at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, where anxious families awaited relatives detained for hours after flights from countries affected by the presidential order.\n\nAt Los Angeles International Airport, hundreds of people had gathered to protest Trump's order, as chants of \"refugees are welcome here\" echoed through the arrivals hall.\n\nIBM\u2014Whose CEO Advises Trump\u2014Calls for 'Openness' After Immigration Ban\n\nOrganizers estimated that more than 10,000 people packed Boston's Copley Square to hear Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a vocal critic of Trump and a leader of the Democratic Party's liberal wing, and other speakers.\n\nDuring the protests, dozens of Muslims, some of them kneeling on protest signs, bowed in prayer on rugs laid out on a grassy patch of ground in the square.\n\nIn Houston, which was already filling up with visitors for next Sunday's Super Bowl, about 500 people marched through the downtown.\n\nJennifer Fagen, 47, a sociology professor at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, said she hoped she did not lose her job for protesting.\n\nIraq Threatens Ban on U.S. Citizens, Putting the Fight Against ISIS at Risk\n\n\"I'm Jewish, and it's supposed to be 'never again,'\" Fagen said, referring to the Holocaust. \"Jews should be the first ones to defend Muslims, considering what has happened to us, and it seems it's being repeated under Trump.\"\n\nAt Detroit Metropolitan Airport, police cordoned off sections of terminal as up to 3,000 demonstrators chanted, \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here.\"\n\nAmong the demonstrators were Wail Aljirafi and his wife, Samyeh Zindani of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and their three children.\n\n\"We want them to feel that they're always included,\" Zindani, a Yemeni-American, told Reuters.\n\nAirbnb to Offer Free Housing to Blocked Travelers\n\nIn the Detroit suburb of Hamtramck, Michigan, home to a large number of Yemeni immigrant families and the nation's first Muslim-majority city council, at least 600 people rallied outside City Hall.\n\nRama Alhoussaini, 23, a Syrian immigrant who lives in nearby Dearborn, said she and her family emigrated to Michigan in 1999 when she was six years old.\n\n\"Now for us to see this kind of hatred and bigotry, it breaks my heart,\" she said. \"It makes me feel like I am not wanted here.\"", "source": "Fortune", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Reuters", "type": "article"}
