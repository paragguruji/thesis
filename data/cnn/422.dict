While the measure doesn't reference Islam specifically, advocacy groups said the order was plainly targeting Muslims.\n\nThe order, if enacted, would put in place tough new vetting measures in an attempt to bar potential terrorists from entering the country. Sources familiar with the order said Trump could sign it as early as Friday, but caution the language is not yet final. A senior White House official made it clear that Trump will not sign executive orders Thursday targeting the refugee program or immigration from terror-prone countries.\n\n\"In order to protect Americans, we must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles,\" the order reads. \"We cannot, and should not, admit into our country those who do not support the US. Constitution, or those who would place violent religious edicts over American law.\"\n\nThe plan outlined in the draft order indicates that once the 120-day suspension of refugee admissions ends, the US prioritize admissions of those refugees who are fleeing religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality,\" according to the order.\n\nRead More", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "authors": "Kevin Liptak, CNN White House Producer", "type": "article"}
