And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\"\n\nTrump did not name a reason or offer any evidence about why the agencies that vet refugees, including the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, would have prioritized Muslim refugees over Christians.\n\nAccording to a report by the non-partisan Pew Research Center, however, 99% of the nearly 12,600 Syrians granted refugee status last year were Muslims. Less than 1% were Christian. Syria's population is 87% Muslim and 10% Christian, according to the CIA World Fact Book.", "section": "politics", "source": "CNN", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "authors": "Daniel Burke, CNN Religion Editor", "type": "article"}
