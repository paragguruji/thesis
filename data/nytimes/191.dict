Bush, in a decision delivered from the bench.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling was temporary, putting Mr. Trump\u2019s policy on hold at least until the government and opponents of the order had a chance to make full arguments, or until the administration won a stay.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the A.C.L.U. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously more litigation to come, but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nIt is not unusual for district courts to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions, and the federal government must obey such injunctions even when other district courts have declined to issue injunctions in similar cases.\n\nJudge Robart temporarily barred the administration from enforcing two parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s order: its 90-day suspension of entry into the United States of people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 and its limits on accepting refugees, including \u201cany action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities.\u201d\n\nThe order had suspended admissions of any refugees for 120 days, and of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The goal, the president said, was to evaluate the process for vetting refugees and other immigrants in order to safeguard the country against terrorism.\n\nThe order said that when immigration from the seven countries resumed, persecuted religious minorities would be given preference, and in an interview the day of the signing, Mr. Trump said the United States would give Christians from those countries priority because they had suffered \u201cmore so than others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJudge Robart made clear that his order applied nationwide, citing a similar nationwide injunction from a federal district court in Texas that had blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to legally work in the United States.\n\nSince Mr. Trump signed his order on Jan. 27, there has been widespread confusion over the policy and disagreement over how it was being carried out, flummoxing immigration lawyers, government officials and travelers. Shortly before the Seattle ruling, a different federal judge, Nathaniel M. Gorton in Boston, ruled in favor of the government by declining to extend a temporary halt to the order in that jurisdiction.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some arrived at airports for flights and were turned away.\n\nThe president\u2019s order allowed for exceptions in the \u201cnational interest,\u201d but lawyers for some travelers had described getting one as a Kafkaesque exercise, with the State Department\u2019s website warning that no emergency applications would be heard, and Customs and Border Protection agents at United States airports all but unreachable because their clients were not being allowed to board planes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear it was not all that thought out,\u201d Judge Leonie Brinkema of Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in yet another court hearing held Friday. \u201cAs a result there has been chaos.\u201d\n\nProtests over the policy continued on Friday, including a large group that gathered in a parking lot of Kennedy International Airport in New York for the Friday Prayer.\n\nOne big question surrounded the number of people who were affected by the travel ban.\n\nBesides barring refugees and other visa holders from the seven countries from entering the United States, the administration also revoked, at least temporarily, all visas from the seven countries, including those for people currently living in the United States. The revocations, which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings, meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to re-enter the United States if they left.\n\nIn the Virginia courtroom, spectators gasped when a lawyer for the government told Judge Brinkema, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, that more than 100,000 visas had been revoked as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. A State Department official later contradicted that number, saying that it mistakenly included diplomatic visas that were untouched by the ban as well as expired visas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe true figure was \u201cfewer than 60,000,\u201d said William Cocks, a spokesman for the department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs.\n\n\u201cTo put that number in context, we issued over 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year 2015,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBecause the court fights so far have centered on whether judges should impose and keep in place temporary restraining orders, the legal arguments in the last few days have centered on the government\u2019s contention that there is \u201cno potential irreparable harm\u201d to justify keeping the extraordinary orders in place pending fuller briefing and arguments.\n\nBut Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, who opposed the Trump administration in the Seattle case, said the decision Friday \u201cshuts down the executive order nationwide and immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope the federal government will understand what they did was unconstitutional and unlawful,\u201d he said.", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Nicholas Kulish, Caitlin Dickerson and Charlie Savage", "type": "article"}
