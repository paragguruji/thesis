(An earlier version of the ban included Iraq.)\n\nThe Trump administration has now made the definition explicit.\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable obtained by The New York Times, \u201cclose family\u201d is \u201cdefined as a parent (including parent-in-law), spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, whether whole or half. This includes step relationships.\u201d\n\nBut it went on to state that \u201cclose family\u201d does not include \u201cgrandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-laws and sisters-in-law, fianc\u00e9s and any other \u2018extended\u2019 family members.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how the administration arrived at the new definitions.\n\nUnder existing law, Americans may petition for immigration visas for \u201cimmediate relatives\u201d \u2014 defined as the parents, spouses and children (under 21) of United States citizens.\n\nOther relatives may be granted immigration visas, but there is a ranking of preferences, and the visas are subject to numerical limitations: first, unmarried adult children of citizens; then spouses and children (under 21) of permanent residents; then married adult children of American citizens; and, finally, siblings of adult American citizens. But those definitions apply to people seeking to immigrate \u2014 not merely to visit.\n\nA bona fide relationship with a \u201cU.S. entity,\u201d according to the cable, \u201cmust be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O.,\u201d or executive order.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
