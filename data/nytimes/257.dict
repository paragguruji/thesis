{"title": "Erdogan Curbs Criticism of Trump, Seeking Warmer Relationship", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/world/middleeast/turkey-us-relations.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Turkish-American relations frayed over differing views on the war in Syria and the widespread belief in Turkey that the United States played a role in a failed coup last summer. In recent months, Turkey grew frustrated at America\u2019s refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based leader of a religious social movement whom the Turkish government accuses of organizing the coup attempt in July. This compounded a longer-running feud concerning American support for the leading Kurdish militia in northern Syria, which Turkey regards as a terrorist group.\n\nNow that Mr. Trump has entered office, Ankara hopes for a change in America\u2019s policy toward the Syrian Kurds. Specifically, Mr. Erdogan wants the United States to scrap an Obama-era plan to work with Kurds to recapture Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State, and try instead with Turkish troops and Syrian Arab militias.\n\nAt the same time, Turkish officials believe the Trump administration is more likely to support extradition of Mr. Gulen and could crack down on Mr. Gulen\u2019s supporters in the United States, where they operate a network of schools.\n\n\u201cHopes are very high in Ankara that Turkey-U.S. relations will be much better under a Trump administration than the previous administration,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization. \u201cErdogan does not want to endanger these two issues by speaking out against the Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nThe meeting this past week between Mr. Erdogan and Mike Pompeo, the new head of the C.I.A., was interpreted in Turkey as a good sign \u2014 as was the phone call Wednesday between the two presidents. And Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reported that his phone conversation with Vice President Mike Pence had heralded a \u201cnew day\u201d in relations.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing on the ground is that Trump has stopped the plan,\u201d Mr. Cevik said, referring to the Obama administration\u2019s plan to arm the Syrian Kurds for the offensive on Raqqa. He was meeting with a New York Times journalist as Mr. Pompeo spoke to Mr. Erdogan in another part of the president\u2019s palace. \u201cTurkey has received information that this is the case.\u201d\n\nBut Washington insiders are more skeptical and say Turkish officials may have misplaced their hopes for specific changes in American policy in Syria.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the Turks are so confident,\u201d said Aaron Stein, a Turkey-focused analyst at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. And James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey, said, \u201cThey\u2019re just not a strong enough force\u201d to be the only American partner in Raqqa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe phone call on Wednesday was most likely a routine conversation, Mr. Stein said, while the suspension of the Raqqa plan may yet be lifted once the Trump administration completes a 30-day review of Obama-era policies. Turkish troops and their Syrian allies, who have struggled to take the Islamic State-held city of Al Bab in recent months, may not be the best short-term partners in the fight for Raqqa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple for the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Stein said by telephone. \u201cThey can either delay the operation for Raqqa into 2018, and entertain using a Turkish force without the Y.P.G.,\u201d a reference to the Syrian Kurdish force that President Obama considered arming. \u201cOr they can go in the next six months with the Y.P.G.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While the result is still at stake, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to commit to any compromise on Syrian Kurds, as this could endanger his chances of winning the referendum, said Mr. Jeffrey, the former ambassador.\n\nBut after the referendum, Mr. Jeffrey said, \u201cthen Erdogan may have more flexibility to accept the same or even greater role for the U.S. and the Y.P.G. \u2014 as long as he gets three things.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Jeffrey, the United States would need to convince Turkey of its commitment to engagement with the Middle East, clearly demonstrate its opposition to a single Kurdish statelet along Turkey\u2019s entire southern border and give Turkey at least a small role in the Raqqa operation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr. Cevik suggested that Turkey might tolerate some kind of Kurdish entity in northeastern Syria, but would not accept any Kurdish presence in majority-Arab areas west of the Euphrates River.\n\n\u201cWe will knock them out from Manbij, west of Euphrates,\u201d Mr. Cevik said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch them east of the Euphrates.\u201d\n\nMr. Cevik added that it would also be crucial for the Syrian Kurds to distance themselves from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., a Kurdish group that has waged an insurgency in southeastern Turkey for decades, and that Turkey, the United States and European countries have listed as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t they be another Barzani?\u201d Mr. Cevik asked, referring to Masoud Barzani, the leader of the Kurdish region in Iraq. \u201cBarzani has excellent ties with Turkey.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "authors": "Patrick Kingsley and Tim Arango", "type": "article"}
