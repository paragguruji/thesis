Three al Qaeda operatives were also killed in the clandestine strike, military officials said, according to NBC News.\n\nThe strike was carried out in southern Yemen over the weekend and was put together by the Joint Special Operations Command and carried out by the elite SEAL Team 6, the same unit that famously killed Osama bin Laden.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything went wrong,\u201d one military official told NBC News. First, the helicopter the SEAL team members were riding in made a hard landing, causing injuries to two of the SEALs. Then a firefight with enemy combatants broke out, leaving U.S. Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens dead.\n\nIt was in that firefight that Nawar al-Awlaki, also known as Nora, was killed, though the details of exactly how she died are in dispute. Nora, 8, is the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S. born Muslim cleric-turned al Qaeda extremist who was killed in 2011 by a U.S. drone strike. The U.S. official said Nora and several Yemeni women were also killed in the raid, but that some of the women had opened fire on the SEALs.\n\nNasser al-Awlaki, the girl\u2019s grandfather, gave NBC News a different version of events of what took place. \u201cMy granddaughter was staying for a while with her mother, so when the attack came, they were sitting in the house, and a bullet struck her in her neck at 2:30 past midnight. Other children in the same house were killed,\u201d he said. Nora died from her injuries two hours after suffering the gunshot wound, he said. The grandfather went on to say that the SEALs burned the home after raiding it, and that Nora\u2019s mother escaped the raid with only a minor injury. The U.S. has also killed Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s father and son in previous drone strikes.\n\nThe grandfather said his daughter and granddaughter were in the region because they fled the fighting in Sa\u2019ana, Yemen\u2019s capital, where a civil war has been raging for nearly two years. Photos of Nora began surfacing on social media over the last 24 hours, showing a smiley little girl. Other images, the authenticity of which couldn\u2019t be confirmed, purported to show the girl\u2019s dead body. The news of Nora\u2019s death comes amid global controversy over Trump\u2019s travel ban, temporarily barring entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. Yemen is one of the nations on the list.\n\nRead the full story at NBC News.\n\nRelated\n\nEmaciated teen whose heartbreaking photos made her the \u2018face of famine\u2019 in Yemen is recovering\n\nTrump fires acting attorney general who defied him on controversial travel ban\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s travel ban feels like it\u2019s \u2018keeping us safe\u2019 from an invented threat", "authors": ["Witw Staff"], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["girl", "death", "results", "8yearold", "travel", "trump", "raid", "nora", "yemen", "administrations", "seal", "strike", "nbc", "trumps", "killed", "military", "american", "1st"], "summary": "The first military raid carried out under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration resulted in deadly consequences for an 8-year-old American girl and a U.S. Navy SEAL.\nThree al Qaeda operatives were also killed in the clandestine strike, military officials said, according to NBC News.\n\u201cAlmost everything went wrong,\u201d one military official told NBC News.\nPhotos of Nora began surfacing on social media over the last 24 hours, showing a smiley little girl.\nThe news of Nora\u2019s death comes amid global controversy over Trump\u2019s travel ban, temporarily barring entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries."}
