Even with valid visas in hand, some were refused entry at American airports and others were removed from planes scheduled to fly to the United States.\n\nThere was also confusion because the executive order, at least initially, barred entry to Iraqis who held American green cards. Many of them, but not all, were eventually permitted to enter the United States.\n\nThe Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt from the travel ban Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who had demonstrated their commitment to American military forces.\n\nMunther A. and his family were removed from a Turkish Airlines flight in Istanbul on Saturday just as they had settled into their seats for a scheduled flight to Kennedy Airport. They were forced to fly back to Baghdad, he said.\n\nMost Iraqis holding the special visas have sold their homes, cars and other possessions in anticipation of starting a new life in the United States. Munther A. said his family had been forced to find emergency housing with friends in Baghdad.\n\nSince 2007, the State Department has issued more than 1,700 Special Immigrant Visas to Iraqi interpreters and their family members.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe embassy in Baghdad did not disclose the number of Iraqis affected by the change in the Trump administration\u2019s visa ban. Only 19 such visas were issued to Iraqi interpreters and their families during the past three years, according to State Department figures.\n\nMr. Trump said when he issued the executive order that it was intended to allow American officials to vet Iraqis and others more thoroughly. But the interpreters had extensive security vetting before they were permitted to accompany American forces. They spent years clearing more background security checks while applying for the special visas.\n\nEven after the phone call from the embassy, Munther A. and his family were initially turned away by airline officials in Baghdad on Thursday as they tried to board a connecting flight to Doha, Qatar. He called a telephone number provided by the embassy, he said, and the problem was resolved.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They were given American nicknames like Tony and Bobby and Max. They often wore scarves across their faces to mask their identities.\n\nThey risked their lives as the eyes and ears of the American military in Iraq. They did far more than just interpret, guiding American soldiers and commanders through Iraqi politics, tribal disputes and social customs.\n\nOther Iraqis who assisted the American military or government in Iraq indirectly remained in limbo on Thursday. Many had received refugee visas to resettle in the United States with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, but they were blocked by the travel ban this week.\n\nA 33-year-old Iraqi father of two who worked seven years for a contractor that supplied American troops said he and his family had been granted visas for relocation to Charlotte, N.C., after passing extensive security checks. They were scheduled to fly from Iraq to the United States on Thursday, said the man, who asked to be identified as Ahmed A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was told by the International Organization for Migration this week that his flight had been canceled because of the travel ban. Having already sold his home and car and quit his job, he scrambled to find a place to live with friends in Erbil, Iraq.\n\nAhmed A. said he had heard nothing from the International Organization for Migration as of Thursday. A spokesman for the organization in Iraq did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere also was confusion on Thursday for Qusay Fawzi Ahmed, 38, a former military interpreter who moved to Tampa, Fla., in 2012, after receiving a special immigrant visa.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Ahmed was awaiting a phone call from his fianc\u00e9e, Marwa Nasr al-Din, who was flying to New York from Iraq with a valid visa in her passport. After years of waiting, she said, she received approval to join her fianc\u00e9.\n\nMr. Ahmed, who works at Domino\u2019s, said he was delivering a pizza in Tampa when his fianc\u00e9e called him from Kennedy Airport. She told him she had been detained and ordered to fly back to Cairo, where her flight had originated, and then to her home in Erbil.\n\n\u201cMy fianc\u00e9e is a 25-year-old girl \u2014 she\u2019s not going to bomb anything,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said in a telephone interview.\n\nMs. Din said on Thursday that she had been unable to find out when, or whether, her visa would allow her to join her fianc\u00e9 in Tampa.\n\n\u201cIs this the freedom and democracy we have heard about in the U.S.A.?\u201d she asked.", "authors": ["David Zucchino"], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["amended", "iraqi", "ban", "visas", "family", "iraq", "iraqis", "united", "flight", "munther", "interpreters", "special", "american", "visa", "allow"], "summary": "The travel ban has thrown the lives of many former interpreters in Iraq into turmoil.\nMost Iraqis holding the special visas have sold their homes, cars and other possessions in anticipation of starting a new life in the United States.\nSince 2007, the State Department has issued more than 1,700 Special Immigrant Visas to Iraqi interpreters and their family members.\nOnly 19 such visas were issued to Iraqi interpreters and their families during the past three years, according to State Department figures.\nThey spent years clearing more background security checks while applying for the special visas."}
