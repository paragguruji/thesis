Flynn, a retired Army general who has written that \u201cfear of Muslims is rational,\u201d has said that \u201cIslam is a political ideology\u201d and is \u201clike a malignant cancer.\u201d For director of central intelligence, Mr. Trump has tapped Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who has said that \u201cmost Islamic leaders across America\u201d were complicit in terrorist attacks for not speaking out more forcefully.\n\nHe has asked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has endorsed a Muslim immigration ban, to be attorney general, and has named Stephen K. Bannon, whom critics have denounced as a white nationalist, as senior White House strategist. And some Trump supporters have cited the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II as a possible precedent.\n\n\u201cI did not take Trump\u2019s statements seriously enough, and I did not take these white nationalists as seriously as I should have,\u201d said Zareena Grewal, an associate professor of American studies and religious studies at Yale. \u201cThat these people have moved from the fringe of American politics to the very center should frighten everybody.\u201d\n\nHanan Hassan, a native of Iraq who works at a refugee center in Phoenix, mostly with people from Syria, said her mood and that of her clients had changed drastically.\n\n\u201cSome of us are scared of being sent back,\u201d she said. \u201cOur children are having issues at school.\u201d\n\nMs. Hassan, 37, who said her parents and her brother were killed by a car bomb in Baghdad, said, \u201cWe left home because it was not safe there,\u201d but now the United States feels unsafe.\n\nSome voiced worries about a Muslim registry, and the prospect of being tracked and investigated by the government, noting that a registry for noncitizens from some Arab countries, in effect from 2002 to 2011, resulted in few leads on terrorism, but many deportations. Others shrugged off the prospect, saying that they assumed they were under surveillance already.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd people were still unsure how seriously to take the even more troubling idea \u2014 not raised by anyone with a formal role on the Trump team \u2014 of internment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t put it past them,\u201d said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council of American Islamic Relations. \u201cPersonnel is policy, and Flynn considers us as the enemy, so what kind of policies is he going to push forward? The Muslim community will be at his mercy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

I\u2019m not saying that it definitely won\u2019t happen. The fact that we\u2019re even having this conversation is really spreading a lot of fear in the community.\u201d\n\nMuslim leaders said their strategy would be to mount legal challenges and to strengthen alliances with other religious and ethnic groups.\n\nMuslim, Jewish and Christian clergy members and lay leaders gathered in front of mosque in Washington on Friday in a demonstration of mutual support. Mobilized by an interfaith group called \u201cShoulder to Shoulder,\u201d they asked President-elect Trump to keep his election-night promise that he will serve as the president of all Americans.\n\n\u201cAmerican Muslims follow the U.S. Constitution,\u201d said Rizwan Jaka, chairman of the board of the ADAMS Center, one of the nation\u2019s largest mosques, in Northern Virginia. \u201cWe call upon this incoming administration to also follow it.\u201d\n\nThey refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump or his selections, and instead called on them to recognize that American Muslims serve the United States as doctors, teachers and law enforcement officers. They said that, contrary to claims by Mr. Pompeo and others, American Muslims routinely denounce terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists, and have been credited by the Department of Homeland Security with preventing attacks by reporting suspects to the authorities.\n\nUsama Shami, president of the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix, said he had received an outpouring of support from non-Muslims, including some who came in person to join in Friday Prayers, and others who offered to register as Muslims if a registry is created.\n\n\u201cAll of that gives us comfort,\u201d Mr. Shami said. \u201cThe problem is, in this day and age \u2014 this is 2016, almost 2017 \u2014 we\u2019re going backward. Make America great again? How? Having an internment camp for Muslims as they had for Japanese? Appointing Islamophobes for key positions?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, some Muslims held out hope that the Trump team may be more bluster than real threat.\n\n\u201cHe is a businessman, and businessmen have plenty of masks they wear everyday,\u201d said Heshem Hassane, 42, an Egyptian immigrant who owns an ironworks in New York. He expressed doubt about whether the new administration would follow through on some plans, but added, \u201cthere\u2019s no person who\u2019s not concerned unless he\u2019s isolated about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nFor many Muslims, their fears are less about Trump administration policies than about a hostile atmosphere that they say could promote violence against them. The FBI reported this week that anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 67 percent in 2015, and Muslim groups say 2016 is on track to be worse.\n\n\u201cEvery day people are calling from all over the country to tell me about incidents and attacks, and I have to tell people, I\u2019m not a Trump emergency responder,\u201d Dr. Grewal said. \u201cPeople are worried about their actual, physical safety, about attacks. People are asking, \u2018Do we buy a gun? Do we get a dog?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor many Muslims, the worst prospect of all is that members of their community, alienated by the political atmosphere and government action, could heed calls by Islamic extremists to carry out terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cISIS will have more disenfranchised people, people pushed to the margins, to appeal to,\u201d Mr. Awad said. \u201cThis is music to their ears.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-11-19", "authors": "Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Laurie Goodstein", "type": "article"}
