It cannot believe that the ban is truly necessary to protect the United States from a terrorist attack; otherwise it would not have delayed the announcement of the revised ban to allow positive press from the address to Congress to sit for a few days. This ban cannot be about public safety either. Study after study shows that the immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.\n\nTo see this order as anything other than a Muslim ban is willful blindness. This is just another tragic example of this astonishing lack of empathy for anyone the administration believes is different.\n\nSTEVEN RASHIN, NEW YORK\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhile there can be reasoned objections to President Trump\u2019s revised executive order excluding six heavily Muslim countries from entry into the United States, the Op-Ed essay by Farhana Khera and Johnathan Smith (\u201cDon\u2019t Be Fooled, Trump\u2019s New Muslim Ban Is Still Illegal,\u201d nytimes.com, March 6) degenerates into an emotionally charged denunciation of the order as an \u201call-out assault on Islam and Muslims.\u201d They lose all credibility with that indictment of Mr. Trump.\n\nAmong the countries not included in the ban are Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. All of them are predominantly Muslim states, and Saudi Arabia in particular is an avowedly Islamic theocracy with a very strict brand of Sunni Islam at the core of its official identity. So how, pray, is President Trump\u2019s visa ban an assault on Islam and Muslims as such?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVIPAN CHANDRA, ATTLEBORO, MASS.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s position on illegal immigration (and regardless of whom you voted for in the election), it must be acknowledged that separating children from their parents is nothing short of terrorizing to the child.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
