Polls have shown a majority of Americans oppose the concept of barring Muslims, while Republicans remain divided about it. The retreat on Thursday was the latest example of the Trump campaign changing a position as the election approaches.\n\nMr. Trump recently softened his position on immigration, forgoing his calls for mass deportation in favor of a focus on \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d Mr. Pence was also one of the first members of the campaign to publicly acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, paving the way for Mr. Trump to finally end his false conspiracy theory about Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace last month.\n\nDuring the vice-presidential debate this week, Mr. Pence brushed off many of Mr. Trump\u2019s startling comments from the campaign, disregarding some as reflecting a lack of political polish and denying that others were ever said.\n\nBut critics of Mr. Trump are not letting his campaign off the hook for the Muslim ban so easily.\n\n\u201cGovernor Pence\u2019s flagrant attempts to mislead voters on his running mate\u2019s positions aren\u2019t fooling anyone,\u201d said Zara Rahim, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign. \u201cNot only has Trump proposed an unconstitutional immigration ban on an entire religion, but he\u2019s suggested creating a database that tracks Muslims in this country.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on,\u201d the release said.\n\nBut in a separate interview on MSNBC on Thursday, Mr. Pence made clear that the Muslim ban was no longer on the table. Such a proposal, he seemed to suggest, would be absurd.\n\n\u201cSo not a ban on all Muslims?\u201d Joe Scarborough, the host of \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d asked Mr. Pence.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Mr. Pence replied.", "publish_date": "2016-10-07", "authors": "Alan Rappeport", "type": "article"}
