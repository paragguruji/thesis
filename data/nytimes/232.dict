It has yet not issued a ruling, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Trump, who wrote early Wednesday morning on Twitter, \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!\u201d\n\nIn a speech to law-enforcement officials a few hours later, he called the hearing \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d complained that the courts are \u201cso political\u201d and said that \u201cif these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they\u2019d do what they should be doing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the judges did exactly as they should, aggressively questioning both sides and demanding evidence to back up assertions \u2014 a much quicker and more reliable path to the truth than Twitter. At one point, Judge William Canby Jr. asked August Flentje, the Justice Department lawyer defending the order, which was apparently prepared with no advice from legal or national security officials, \u201cHow many federal offenses have we had being committed by people that came in with visas from these countries?\u201d\n\nMr. Flentje declined to answer, saying that the litigation was moving very fast. He then referred to \u201ca number of people from Somalia\u201d who had been convicted of terrorist crimes in the United States, but said that the government had not included any of these cases in the record.\n\nFor stretches of the hourlong argument, the judges and lawyers waded deep into the case\u2019s various procedural technicalities \u2014 not material that would usually appeal to a wide audience. But that is the majestic routine of the law: applying well-established precedents and principles to decide cases in the present and provide some assurance of predictability for the future. It may not carry the adrenaline hit of a tweet, but it has kept the country relatively stable and peaceful for most of its history.\n\nMr. Trump appears as uninterested in this as he is in so much else about the democratic process. He complained on Wednesday about the pace of the legal debate on the travel ban, which is not even two weeks old, saying it is \u201creally incredible\u201d that it is \u201cgoing on so long.\u201d\n\nThe president continues to demean his office in 140-character increments, firing off nasty and reflexive broadsides at anyone who doesn\u2019t agree completely with him. Meanwhile, on Tuesday afternoon, the tedious, necessary work of a branch of government Mr. Trump sometimes seems to wish did not exist reminded the country what government based on the rule of law looks like.", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
