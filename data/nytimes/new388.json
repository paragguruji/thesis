Conway III, who withdrew last week as Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for assistant attorney general for the civil division and whose wife, Kellyanne Conway, is the president\u2019s counselor, commented on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s posts.\n\n\u201cThese tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters,\u201d he wrote in his own Twitter post, referring to the Office of the Solicitor General and the Supreme Court of the United States. \u201cSad.\u201d\n\nStill, some administration supporters said the court should not consider the tweets. While looking beyond the letter of the order might be appropriate in domestic policy, the president has a freer hand in foreign policy, said David B. Rivkin Jr., a lawyer in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. \u201cAs a constitutional matter, as a legal matter, it should make absolutely no difference,\u201d he said of the president\u2019s extracurricular messaging.\n\nLast week, lawyers in the solicitor general\u2019s office filed polished briefs in the Supreme Court. They urged the justices to ignore incendiary statements from Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, including a call for a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d The court should focus instead on the text of the revised executive order and statements from Mr. Trump after he had taken the inaugural oath to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution,\u201d the briefs said.\n\nMr. Trump, his lawyers said, was now a changed man, alert to the burdens and responsibilities of his office.\n\n\u201cTaking that oath marks a profound transition from private life to the nation\u2019s highest public office, and manifests the singular responsibility and independent authority to protect the welfare of the nation that the Constitution reposes in the president,\u201d they wrote.\n\nOn Twitter early Monday, though, Mr. Trump appeared to say that the latest executive order was of a piece with the earlier one, issued in January, and with his longstanding positions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn calling the revised order \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d Mr. Trump suggested that his goal throughout had been to exclude travelers based on religion. And in calling the revised order \u201cwatered down,\u201d he made it harder for his lawyers to argue that it was a clean break from the earlier one, which had mentioned religion.\n\nThe Supreme Court has asked people and groups challenging the executive order to file their responses to the government\u2019s briefs next Monday. Those responses will almost certainly rely on Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets in arguing that the justices should not revive the order. The court will probably act on the government\u2019s requests in the coming weeks.\n\nIn his posts, Mr. Trump seemed to betray a misunderstanding of how two branches of the federal government work. His criticism of the Justice Department was misplaced, because it works for him. He could have insisted that it defend his original order. It was Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, too, to issue the revised order.\n\nMr. Trump also suggested that the Justice Department could ask the Supreme Court to impose a \u201cmuch tougher version\u201d of his executive order. But the court\u2019s role is limited to evaluating the lawfulness of the current order.\n\nInsulting judges is also generally a poor litigation strategy. But Mr. Trump also posted that \u201cthe courts are slow and political!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s adversaries certainly welcomed his tweets.\n\n\u201cIt just adds to the mountain of already existing evidence that the government has had to ask the court over and over to ignore,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people and groups challenging the law. \u201cBlinding the courts to a reality that everyone else is aware of is never an attractive position, but is especially problematic when you have to ignore in real time what\u2019s being said by the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nNeal K. Katyal, who represents Hawaii in a separate challenge to the order, said there was a yawning gap between Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and his lawyers\u2019 filings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s statements, before, during and after his inauguration, continually demonstrate what his so-called travel ban is really about,\u201d Mr. Katyal said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising his story and his tweets don\u2019t match up with what the solicitor general has been trying to say in court.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was also daylight between the president and his aides about what to call the executive order.\n\n\u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nBut his own staff members had insisted it was not a travel ban. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, spent much of one early briefing telling reporters not to call it that. \u201cIt\u2019s not a travel ban,\u201d Mr. Spicer insisted. \u201cWhen we use words like travel ban, that misrepresents what it is.\u201d\n\nAt the time, John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, also rejected the phrase. \u201cThis is not a travel ban,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting system.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s posts came as Ms. Conway went on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and chastised the news media for focusing too much on the president\u2019s Twitter feed, calling it an \u201cobsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.\u201d\n\nThe revised executive order, which the president criticized on Monday, took Iraq off the list of countries that would be affected and made clear that the restrictions did not apply to those who held green cards or valid visas. It also eliminated a provision that seemed to prioritize Christian refugees for entry.\n\nThe revised order, like the first, barred all refugees from entering the country for 120 days. It limited entry for 90 days for visitors from six countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.\n\nThe administration said it chose those six nations and Iraq from a list of \u201ccountries of concern\u201d identified in a law signed by President Barack Obama in 2015. But experts have said that since the Sept. 11 attacks, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from any of those nations.\n\nThis was not the first time the president had expressed second thoughts about revising the original order. In March, after a Federal District Court in Hawaii blocked the revised version, Mr. Trump complained that it was only \u201ca watered-down version of the first order\u201d and told a rally of supporters that \u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way\u201d to the Supreme Court, \u201cwhich is what I wanted to do in the first place.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak", "Peter Baker"], "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "original", "travel", "case", "eroding", "trump", "revised", "ban", "court", "trumps", "order", "president", "promotes", "mr", "legal"], "summary": "George T.
