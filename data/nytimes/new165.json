Among North American travelers, trips to Iran with Intrepid Travel had grown 35 percent in the past year, on pace with Iceland, Japan and Sri Lanka, three other trending destinations. Cox & Kings said it had doubled its traffic to Iran in the past 12 months. Wilderness Travel went from offering one itinerary in 2016 to three in 2017. The founder of Abercrombie & Kent, Geoffrey Kent, singled out Iran as a top destination in 2017.\n\nThese and other operators say previously announced trips will run. They have taken a wait-and-see position regarding whether Iran will retaliate with its own travel ban, as its government has suggested.\n\n\u201cOur customers are very adventurous and want to travel, so probably there would be a shift in travel rather than canceling and staying home for a year,\u201d said Warren Chang, the chief operating officer of Cox & Kings.\n\nGetting into Iran requires a visa that travelers can apply for no sooner than 90 days before their trip, said Annie Lucas, vice president of Mir Corporation, a tour operator based in Seattle that has been guiding trips in Iran for close to 20 years.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get one a year in advance,\u201d Ms. Lucas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a timeline. That\u2019s what calls it all into question. There are a lot of people waiting for approvals.\u201d\n\nThe presidential directive set a 90-day deadline to review the United States\u2019 procedures for vetting travelers from the seven countries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They don\u2019t like being pushed around.\u201d\n\nSmarTours, based in New York, had just begun selling its first trips to Iran in January and still plans to run that first group departure in July, with monthly departures thereafter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an element of Iran as the new Cuba, with a few twists,\u201d said Greg Geronemus, a chief executive of SmarTours. He said the company booked more trips since the president\u2019s order than accepted cancellations.\n\n\u201cI get a sense of a spirit of resolve and defiance among those booking these trips,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the ways they\u2019re saying they disagree with the policy.\u201d\n\nFrank Rosemond, 80, of San Francisco, said he did not plan to alter his booking with SmarTours to visit Iran in October. He said he was excited to see the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the beautifully tiled mosques of Isfahan.\n\n\u201cWe understand the people are friendly, and once again it\u2019s government to government that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Mr. Rosemond said.\n\nWhether Americans venture to Iran or elsewhere, some experts think the order will have a chilling effect on travel in general.\n\n\u201cIt just contributes to a sense of unease,\u201d said Jason Clampet, the editor in chief of the travel news website Skift.com. \u201cNot knowing what the government might do means people will make a safe choice, if they make a decision at all. The flip side is most Americans with summer vacations do them domestically.\u201d\n\nInbound tourism, already challenged by weak exchange rates against the dollar, is another question. Based in England, the agency Responsible Travel said it had experienced a 57 percent decrease in revenue from trips to the United States over the past year and put the country on its \u201cnot hot\u201d list for 2017.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. was already positioned to have a poor year because of the strength of the dollar,\u201d said Mr. Clampet, \u201cand this contributes to another reason not to go.\u201d", "authors": ["Elaine Glusac"], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["iran", "travel", "ban", "growing", "travelers", "united", "trumps", "trips", "chief", "draws", "based", "opposition", "order", "york", "tourism", "executives", "past"], "summary": "Of the seven nations singled out by the executive order, only Iran drew significant interest on the part of leisure travelers.\nAmong North American travelers, trips to Iran with Intrepid Travel had grown 35 percent in the past year, on pace with Iceland, Japan and Sri Lanka, three other trending destinations.\nThey have taken a wait-and-see position regarding whether Iran will retaliate with its own travel ban, as its government has suggested.\nWhether Americans venture to Iran or elsewhere, some experts think the order will have a chilling effect on travel in general.\n\u201cIt just contributes to a sense of unease,\u201d said Jason Clampet, the editor in chief of the travel news website Skift.com."}
