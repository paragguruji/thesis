Mr. Trump is also leaving open the possibility of expanding the ban to other countries, or even putting Iraq back on the banned list if the country\u2019s leaders fail to comply with a requirement that they increase intelligence sharing, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cUnregulated, unvetted travel is not a universal privilege, especially when national security is at stake,\u201d said John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, appearing alongside Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington on Monday.\n\nMr. Kelly said the order was now \u201cprospective\u201d and applied \u201conly to foreign nationals outside of the United States\u201d who do not have a valid visa. None of the men took questions.\n\nThe Trump administration quickly tried to break the legal logjam, filing papers in United States District Court in Washington late on Monday seeking to lift an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban.\n\nVideo\n\nBut the president\u2019s revisions did little to halt criticism from Democrats and immigrant rights advocates, who predicted a renewed fight in the courts.\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, described the new order as a \u201cwatered-down ban\u201d that was still \u201cmeanspirited and un-American.\u201d\n\nMargaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that the new order would \u201ccause extreme fear and uncertainty for thousands of families by, once again, putting anti-Muslim hatred into policy.\u201d\n\nThe new measure will be phased in over the next two weeks to avoid the frenetic, same-day execution of the order in January, which prompted protests across the country and left tearful families stranded at airports abroad and in the United States.\n\nThe redrafted order, delayed by a week so it would not overshadow Mr. Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday, represented a recognition that the rushed first attempt at the ban did not pass muster legally or politically.\n\nAdministration officials privately conceded that the initial version of the order was a political debacle that damaged Mr. Trump\u2019s nascent presidency. But they were much more sanguine about the second order, arguing that the new, multiagency review process could be used in the future to bend Mr. Trump\u2019s uncompromising messages toward Washington\u2019s bureaucratic realities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump signed the first ban with great fanfare, in front of reporters, at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Islamist terrorists. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.\u201d\n\nThis time, the White House issued a photograph of the president signing the order alone at his desk in the Oval Office.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said the revisions rendered moot legal cases against the original travel ban. But opponents said the removal of a section that had granted preferential treatment to victims of religious persecution was a cosmetic change that did nothing to alter the order\u2019s prejudicial purpose. Immigrant rights lawyers had argued that the provision was intended to discriminate against Muslims, pointing to recent statements by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is a retreat, but let\u2019s be clear \u2014 it\u2019s just another run at a Muslim ban,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that sued to stop the first order. \u201cThey can\u2019t unring the bell.\u201d\n\nEric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York and a plaintiff in a suit seeking to block the first order, said his office was reviewing the new ban, adding, \u201cI stand ready to litigate \u2014 again \u2014 in order to protect New York\u2019s families, institutions and economy.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans, who were split over the first travel ban, had a more muted reaction. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who backed the first order, issued a statement saying the revised order \u201cadvances our shared goal of protecting the homeland.\u201d\n\nCitizens of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya will face a 90-day suspension of visa processing as the administration analyzes how to strengthen vetting procedures, according to a homeland security summary of the order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials, who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U.S. Department of State in the last month, Iraq will increase cooperation with the U.S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States,\u201d homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe timing of the ban seemed intended to reset the White House political narrative, after a turbulent week that began with Mr. Trump\u2019s well-received address to Congress. That success was quickly overshadowed by the controversies over Mr. Sessions\u2019s failure to inform the Senate of his contacts with the Russian ambassador and Mr. Trump\u2019s unsupported accusation that President Barack Obama tapped Mr. Trump\u2019s phones during the 2016 campaign.\n\nCritics say that Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d on migrants, especially those fleeing the war in Syria, disregards already stringent screening measures, and the fact that none of the recent terrorist attacks or mass shootings on American soil were perpetrated by people from the nations listed in the ban.\n\nLast week, The Associated Press reported that it had obtained a draft homeland security assessment concluding that citizenship was an \u201cunlikely indicator\u201d of a threat.\n\nHomeland security officials, speaking to reporters by telephone on Monday, pushed back against that news report, arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture.\n\nAn official speaking on the call said the Justice Department had identified 300 \u201crefugees\u201d who were being investigated for their links to Islamist terrorist groups or for holding pro-Islamic State positions. Some of those people already have permanent resident status, the official said.\n\nBut homeland security and Justice Department officials declined to provide further details, and would not say how many of the 300 people being investigated came from the countries covered by the revised travel ban.", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Glenn Thrush", "type": "article"}
