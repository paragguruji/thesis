On the other hand, stars are using the spotlight to broadcast their resistance, starting with Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes.\n\nPhoto\n\nNot everyone wants to hear actors bang on about politics, and audience reception depends on political bent. Many in America who are supportive of Mr. Trump already feel alienated by \u201cHollywood elites,\u201d and might not be tuning in to the Oscars anyway.\n\nBut as public arts funding is threatened with cuts, and Mr. Trump unveils other contentious policies, many actors suddenly feel that they must speak out, even if they\u2019re preaching to a choir eager to lap up their every word.\n\nMatters came to a head when the travel ban went into chaotic effect over the weekend.\n\nOne Oscar contender who was immediately affected was the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose drama \u201cThe Salesman\u201d is up for the Academy Award for best foreign-language film. (His \u201cA Separation\u201d won in 2012.) Now he\u2019s subject to the ban, which sharply limits travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMr. Farhadi said that even if he were granted an exemption to travel, he wouldn\u2019t attend. \u201cTo humiliate one nation with the pretext of guarding the security of another is not a new phenomenon in history and has always laid the groundwork for the creation of future divide and enmity,\u201d Mr. Farhadi said in a statement. He went on to condemn \u201cthe unjust conditions\u201d the order had forced upon citizens of the seven nations.\n\nWill this affect Mr. Farhadi\u2019s Oscar chances? You betcha. Not only has the fracas raised the visibility of his film, but it has also made voting for it a political act. The same goes for the nominated documentary short \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d about civilian Syrian rescuers. One of the film\u2019s subjects and a cameraman were to attend the Oscars, according to the filmmakers, but now are shut out, too. The Iranian-born Swedish actress, Bahar Pars, a star in the Swedish entry \u201cA Man Called Ove,\u201d has said that she is determined to attend as a statement but that details were still being sorted out.\n\nThe ban, which the United Nations says has imperiled 20,000 refugees, also stands to raise the profile of nominated films that explore migrants\u2019 plight, like the documentary feature \u201cFire at Sea\u201d and the shorts \u201cWatani: My Homeland\u201d and The New York Times\u2019s Op-Doc, \u201c4.1 Miles.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs widespread protests roiled airports last weekend, there were questions in Hollywood about whether speakers and winners would take aim at Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Streep had already set a precedent at the Golden Globes in January: She publicly castigated Mr. Trump for being a bully.\n\nIf that speech increased her chances at landing an Oscar nomination for her role in \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d \u2014 and Hollywood chatter holds that it totally did \u2014 Mr. Trump sealed the deal. His tweet the next day, calling her one of Hollywood\u2019s \u201cmost overrated actresses,\u201d fell smack in the middle of the voting window for Oscar nominations. And, lo, a few weeks later, Ms. Streep became a 20-time Oscar nominee.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Awards strategists rarely want their clients to get political, for it could cost them their audiences, especially in red states. While this might not matter much for this season\u2019s smaller films like \u201cMoonlight\u201d or \u201cLoving,\u201d it could hurt films with bigger box-office ambitions, or television shows with outspoken stars.\n\nThis year, though, Hollywood doesn\u2019t seem keen to hold back. At the Producers Guild Awards, presenters and winners emphasized religious freedom, empathy and diversity. Mr. Legend, a presenter at the PGAs and a star of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d said he and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, had wrestled with attending given the larger national controversy afoot, and then drew cheers for declaring, \u201cOur vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump.\u201d\n\nThen came the SAG Awards, which are way more lustrous, for they dole out prizes to glamorous actors and are televised.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf the night\u2019s winners were not emboldened by, erm, Ashton Kutcher, who kicked off the ceremony by welcoming \u201ceveryone in airports that belong in my America,\u201d they surely were by the first winner, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nA member of Hollywood royalty, and clearly comfortable in the spotlight as well as in her own skin, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus made the political personal by revealing that her father had fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France and by denouncing the immigrant ban as \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nThis opened the door, making it O.K. for those who followed to speak out. And they did: Sarah Paulson, Bryan Cranston, Lily Tomlin, Emma Stone, David Harbour and Taraji P. Henson all made assorted impassioned pleas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe classiest one came from Mahershala Ali (\u201cMoonlight\u201d), who, in a quavering voice, spoke of how he and his Christian mother had overcome their differences after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. Mr. Ali is favored to win the Oscar for best supporting actor, and his speech, perhaps the night\u2019s most quietly profound, all but made that certain.\n\nIf there was one consequence Mr. Trump probably didn\u2019t foresee from his travel ban, it would be helping a Muslim American secure an Academy Award.\n\nWhether all of this portends a night of politicizing come the Academy Awards, on Feb. 26, depends on whether controversies set off by the White House or incendiary executive tweets settle down in the next three weeks.
