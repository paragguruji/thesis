It was issued jointly by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez. All three were appointed by President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe ruling affirmed most of a March decision from Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the Federal District Court in Hawaii. But the appeals court narrowed the injunction issued by Judge Watson in a significant way.\n\nThe appeals court said Judge Watson had erred in barring the administration from conducting internal reviews of its vetting procedures while the case moved forward.\n\nThat may turn out to be important as the Supreme Court considers how to address the two cases.\n\nThe key part of the executive order suspended travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days to give the administration time to conduct a review of its vetting procedures. If that review can soon be completed, the justices may decide that the case will soon be moot.\n\nIn briefs filed Monday in the Supreme Court, lawyers challenging the revised executive order urged the court not to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision or to stay the injunctions entered in the two cases.\n\nThey said the cases might be moot as soon as Wednesday, as the 90-day suspension of entry contemplated by the revised executive order was, counting from its effective date, set to expire then.\n\nThe administration has argued that Judge Watson\u2019s ruling stopped the 90-day clock. It asked the justices to agree to hear an appeal of the Fourth Circuit decision before they leave for their summer break and to schedule arguments in the fall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy lifting the part of Judge Watson\u2019s injunction that barred review of internal vetting procedures in the meantime, the Ninth Circuit may have ensured that the case will be moot by the time it is argued, no matter how the 90 days are calculated.\n\n\u201cIt would be unnecessary and wasteful for the court to grant review of an issue that is essentially moot,\u201d lawyers for the State of Hawaii wrote.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Judge Watson wrote that the statements of Mr. Trump and his advisers made clear that his executive order amounted to an attempt to disfavor Muslims.\n\nJudge Watson should not have reached the constitutional issue and should have ruled on statutory grounds, the Ninth Circuit said.\n\n\u201cWe need not, and do not, reach the Establishment Clause claim to resolve this appeal,\u201d the appeals court\u2019s opinion said.\n\nVideo\n\nJudge Watson\u2019s injunction was broader than the one affirmed by the Fourth Circuit. In addition to halting the limits on travel from the six countries, Judge Watson blocked a 120-day suspension of the nation\u2019s refugee program and a 50,000-person cap on refugee admissions in 2017, down from 110,000. The Ninth Circuit affirmed those parts of Judge Watson\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit said it had a role to play in testing Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWhatever deference we accord to the president\u2019s immigration and national security policy judgments does not preclude us from reviewing the policy at all,\u201d the appeals court\u2019s opinion said. \u201cWe do not abdicate the judicial role, and we affirm our obligation \u2018to say what the law is\u2019 in this case,\u201d it added, quoting Marbury v. Madison, the foundational 1803 Supreme Court decision.\n\nA federal law gives the president the power to exclude foreigners if he finds that letting them enter the country \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court said Mr. Trump had exceeded that authority, in large part because he had failed to offer adequate justifications for his order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year,\u201d the court said, \u201cthe president did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The president must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be \u2018detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe court said Mr. Trump\u2019s justifications for the executive order were inadequate.\n\n\u201cThe order does not tie these nationals in any way to terrorist organizations within the six designated countries,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cIt does not identify these nationals as contributors to active conflict or as those responsible for insecure country conditions. It does not provide any link between an individual\u2019s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short,\u201d the opinion concluded, \u201cthe order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court also ruled that the administration had run afoul of another provision of the immigration laws, one that forbids discrimination \u201cbecause of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,\u201d but only \u201cin the issuance of an immigrant visa.\u201d The Trump administration argued that the power to bar entry, the subject of a different provision, was broader than the limits on issuing visas.\n\nThe appeals court said the two provisions must be read together.\n\n\u201cWe cannot blind ourselves to the fact that, for nationals of the six designated countries,\u201d the opinion said, the revised order \u201cis effectively a ban on the issuance of immigrant visas.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["ruling", "travel", "nationals", "trump", "ban", "appeals", "circuit", "judge", "court", "opinion", "countries", "entry", "order", "loses", "watson"], "summary": "The ruling affirmed most of a March decision from Judge Derrick K.
