More than half of the increase in arrests were of immigrants who had committed no crime other than being in the country without permission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s policy was rooted in both humanitarian and budgetary reasons, but to Mr. Trump and his supporters, and many ICE agents, it represented a failure to enforce the law and a de facto amnesty for millions of people in the United States illegally.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies welcomed the news. \u201cI feel that\u2019s one step in the right direction, I definitely feel that way,\u201d said J. D. Ma, a lawyer in Clarksville, Md., who voted for Hillary Clinton but agreed with the president on immigration. \u201cThe reality is that if you don\u2019t do that, that\u2019s going to encourage wave after wave and disrupt the order of the society.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Since Mr. Trump was elected, reports by Latinos of sexual assaults and domestic violence have declined sharply.\n\n\u201cWhat it tells me is that the department is willing to put enforcement numbers ahead of any kind of strategy that would actually try to keep us all safer going forward,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAware of the criticism, the federal authorities have frequently noted that a majority of those arrested \u2014 75 percent in Mr. Trump\u2019s first three months \u2014 were still people with criminal records.\n\nThose swept up have committed a broad range of offenses. Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, a mother in Arizona, had used a false Social Security number to work at a water park. Juan Antonio Melchor Molina, a fugitive from Mexico, is wanted on a murder charge.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough agents are no longer limited in whom they can pick up, Mr. Homan said that more than 2,700 of those arrested had been convicted of serious crimes like assault, rape or murder.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the numbers, the men and women of ICE are still prioritizing these arrests in a way that makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s policies also appear to have slowed the flow of people crossing the southern border illegally, which has reached its lowest number in years, as migrants are choosing to seek refuge in other countries or endure poor conditions at home.\n\nUnless they have already been ordered deported by a judge, immigrants who are arrested can plead their case in immigration courts, which have been snarled by a backlog that exceeds half a million cases. Over all, Mr. Homan said that deportations were down 12 percent from the previous year, partly because of a steep decline in illegal border crossings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe increase in arrests under President Trump is less stark compared with 2011, when President Obama\u2019s immigration agency apprehended 351,029 people, or about 29,000 a month. But arrests and deportations decreased in the years that followed as the Obama administration narrowed its focus to serious criminals.\n\nOther aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda have not produced such quick results. His border wall has yet to be funded by Congress and his travel bans have been blocked by courts. Last month, a federal judge in San Francisco halted the Justice Department\u2019s plans to financially punish so-called sanctuary cities that limit how much local police and jails may cooperate with ICE.\n\nBut at the current rate of arrests, ICE may surpass the highest annual numbers it reached under Mr. Obama in Mr. Trump\u2019s very first year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great news!\u201d said Scott Hayes, a landscaper from Beverly, Mass. Mr. Hayes said he lost two more accounts this year because he was undercut on price, one of them, he believes, to illegal immigrants.\n\nHe said the changes under Mr. Trump were being felt in his area. Mr. Hayes said he was going out to mow a lawn last week and a friend from another landscaping company came running up to him. The friend said the owner of that company was furious with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI said, over what?\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cHe said he can\u2019t find any help! Trump is kicking them all out!\u201d\n\nMr. Hayes added: \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so passionate for Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to expose these guys for who they are, if they are hiring illegal immigrants.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-17", "authors": "Caitlin Dickerson", "type": "article"}
