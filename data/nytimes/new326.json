They worked some of the toughest jobs the West had to offer \u2014 in gold mines, on railroads and in factories \u2014 at wages so low native laborers could not or would not accept them.\n\nIn 1882, Senator John F. Miller, Republican of California, turned racism, resentment and fear into national legislation. His act barred \u201cChinese laborers,\u201d skilled or unskilled, from entering the country for 10 years. It further declared that \u201cno State court or court of the United States shall admit Chinese to citizenship.\u201d\n\nMiller told the Senate on Feb. 28: \u201cIt is a fact of history that wherever the Chinese have gone they have always taken their habits, methods, and civilization with them; and history fails to record a single example in which they have ever lost them. They remain Chinese always and everywhere; changeless, fixed and unalterable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese could be lifted up to the level of the free American, to the adoption and enjoyment of American civilization, the case would be better; but this cannot be done,\u201d he concluded. \u201cForty centuries of Chinese life has made the Chinaman what he is. An eternity of years cannot make him such a man as the Anglo-Saxon.\u201d\n\nThe Times noted his speech in a single paragraph. On the other hand, it gave prominent display on Page 1 to an impassioned rebuttal by Senator George Frisbie Hoar, Republican of Massachusetts. The newspaper reported:\n\n\u201cTaking the ground that the principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created free and equal, is the cardinal principle upon which this Government is established, he went on to declare that no question of policy could be made a pretext for setting it aside to make a distinction against any race of men.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that all the arguments against the negroes used years ago were now applied to the Chinese,\u201d the article continued.\n\nJohn Foord, The Times\u2019s editor-in-chief (a role that was equivalent to that of the editorial page editor today), took exception \u2014 not to Senator Miller\u2019s \u201cmasterly statement,\u201d but to Senator Hoar\u2019s \u201cunfortunate\u201d attempt to liken the races.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is no rational connection between the settled problem of negro citizenship and the unsettled problem of Chinese immigration,\u201d The Times\u2019s editorial said. \u201cThe restrictive bill now under consideration in the Senate does not take away any right from the Chinaman.\u201d\n\nRenewed, expanded and sharpened \u2014 again and again \u2014 the Chinese Exclusion Act remained in force until 1943, when it was repealed by the Magnuson Act, named for Representative Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington.\n\nEditorially, The Times celebrated that \u201cabout 15 acts or parts of acts directed against that mythical creature the \u2018Heathen Chinee\u2019 are scheduled to disappear from our statute books\u201d and applauded the impending admission under quota of cultured, courageous and \u201cinnately democratic\u201d Chinese people: all 105 of them a year.", "authors": ["David W.
