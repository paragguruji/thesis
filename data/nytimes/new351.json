Gorsuch. In theory, at least, Justice Gorsuch bolsters the conservative wing of the court, but there is no guarantee that five justices would agree to overturn a ruling against the administration even if the case does reach them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Orrick of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, issued a temporary injunction on Tuesday preventing the president from holding back billions in federal funding from jurisdictions like San Francisco and Santa Clara County, which filed the lawsuit. The injunction applied nationwide until the judge can rule on the underlying constitutional issues, but he indicated strongly that he leaned against the Trump administration on the matter.\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order shortly after becoming president targeting cities and counties that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities by, for example, refusing in some instances to turn over illegal immigrants held in local jails on other matters or preventing local police officers from inquiring about immigration status.\n\nThe White House reacted with scorn to Judge Orrick\u2019s ruling. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of how the Ninth Circuit went bananas,\u201d Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, told reporters late Tuesday. \u201cIt will be overturned.\u201d\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is generally considered the most liberal in the country, and Mr. Trump elaborated on his pique with it on Twitter on Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cOut of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the \u2018ban\u2019 case and now the \u2018sanctuary\u2019 case is brought in the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey used to call this \u2018judge shopping!\u2019 Messy system.\u201d\n\nThe figure Mr. Trump cited does not refer to all rulings handed down by the appeals court but only to those that the Supreme Court reviewed. In general, the Supreme Court chooses to hear appeals only in cases where it finds a significant dispute, especially if there are different rulings in different lower courts, so such overturn rates tend to be high.\n\nOver all, the Supreme Court overturned about 70 percent of the rulings it chose to review from 2010 to 2015, according to PolitiFact. Among those it took from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it overturned 79 percent, the third highest among the 13 federal appeals courts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe \u201cjudge shopping\u201d that Mr. Trump denounced has been used to thwart presidents of both parties. Just as liberals are now arguing that Mr. Trump has exceeded his executive authority, conservatives made the same case against President Barack Obama and likewise found judges in parts of the country who were more sympathetic to their point of view, often in Texas. But such rulings were often upheld. Mr. Obama\u2019s success rate at the Supreme Court was the lowest of any president in more than a century.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "publish_date": "2017-04-26", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["ninth", "case", "rulings", "trump", "supreme", "immigration", "appeals", "judge", "court", "defiant", "president", "vows", "mr"], "summary": "But Mr. Trump\u2019s confidence in a future victory at the Supreme Court follows the successful confirmation of his appointment of Justice Neil M.
