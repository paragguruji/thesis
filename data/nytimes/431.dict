And while India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, hailed the court decision as a \u201cpowerful measure for women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d some legal analysts were not so sure, saying the all-male panel had used language that was quite degrading toward women.\n\n\u201cThe patronizing tone towards Muslim women in all the opinions is quite breathtaking,\u201d Ratna Kapur, a law professor and author of a forthcoming book on gender and human rights, wrote on Facebook. \u201cWomen are talked about as if they are in need of protection, not in terms of their rights.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cNearly every reference to the Muslim woman in the majority and dissenting opinions reduces Muslim women to \u2018suffering victims.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has often taken the lead in making landmark changes to Indian law. It has demanded that all states reshape their justice systems to make law enforcement independent from political interference. It has forced taxis in the capital to use compressed natural gas as fuel, to reduce pollution. Last year, it banned the sale of fireworks in the capital region to fight smog, and it required movie theaters to play the national anthem.\n\nAlthough India\u2019s Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens regardless of their religion, matters dealing with marriage, divorce, alimony and inheritance are handled differently by members of different religions. India does not have a uniform set of laws on marriage and divorce that applies to all citizens.\n\nIndia is predominantly Hindu, but it has a sizable Muslim population. Many Hindus, seeing the practice of ending a marriage by uttering three words as an insult to women, welcomed the decision on Tuesday. Several Muslim groups, however, had been intent on preserving it, suspicious of any government efforts to chip away at what they see as their fundamental religious rights.\n\nIn recent years, the governing Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has been accused of tolerating Hindu vigilantes who have attacked people for trading cattle and eating beef, and of trying to shut down many of the slaughterhouses that produce buffalo meat. The cow is a revered animal for a large section of Hindus, and many of those attacked have been Muslim.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Some critics suspect that the Modi government\u2019s position had less to do with supporting Muslim women than pleasing Hindu nationalists, who have long argued that the same laws on marriage and divorce should apply to all religious groups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis matter is not just about triple talaq but also about the religious sentiments of the minorities of this country,\u201d said Arshad Madani, president of the Muslim group Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. \u201cMuslims should be ready.\u201d\n\nThere are no official statistics on the prevalence of instant divorce in India, but one study found that among a sample of more than 4,700 women, 525 had divorced, 404 of them through triple talaq.\n\nThe Quran makes no mention of the talaq method. The practice is outlined in the hadiths, or sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, which are regarded as less authoritative than the Quran but are influential in shaping Islamic doctrine.\n\nInstant divorce is fading in most parts of the Muslim world. In many predominantly Muslim countries, religious leaders frown on the practice, noting that the Quran recommends that couples make a genuine effort to reconcile and resolve their differences before parting ways.\n\nThe National Congress party, which casts itself as secular and the guardian of minority rights and counts Muslims as a main constituency, has resisted challenging Muslim divorce practices.\n\nIn 1985, the Supreme Court ordered the husband of a 62-year-old divorced Muslim woman to pay her alimony of about $15 a month.\n\nThe Congress party, in power at the time, moved to nullify the court\u2019s decision and pushed Parliament to adopt a new law shifting responsibility for supporting a divorced wife away from her husband after three months and to her relatives or Muslim charities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat law was a grave disservice to Muslim women, according to Noorjehan Safia Niaz, co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, one of the Muslim women\u2019s advocacy groups that filed a brief in the Supreme Court case.\n\nInstead of making husbands responsible for helping support divorced wives, the new law left women \u201cto beg at different places for maintenance,\u201d she said in the 2014 study.\n\nIshrat Jahan, a plaintiff in the Indian case, said she had been crushed when her husband divorced her over the phone from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cThen he remarried in the village and snatched my children from me,\u201d she said in a television interview.\n\nShe said she was extremely happy with the court decision. \u201cI never thought this would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cMy lawyers are also very happy.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-08-22", "authors": "Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj", "type": "article"}
