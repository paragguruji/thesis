Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325,000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel.\n\nReince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to be wrong on this subject,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cPresident Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject.\u201d\n\nThe order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States.\n\nWith thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThis is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cWe will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the long-running civil war in Syria. \u201cI have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nWhile Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from majority-Muslim nations.\n\nIn a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cChristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d\n\nHis order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nNew York\u2019s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was \u201cin compliance with judicial orders.\u201d\n\nStill, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington.\n\nHis staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and \u201cthey said we\u2019ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,\u201d Mr. Connolly said.\n\n\u201cI said that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That\u2019s where the problem is, and that\u2019s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to \u201cclaw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned.\u201d\n\nThe mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. \u201cWe have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\u201d he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is?

The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she \u201cis convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey.\n\nBut under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did \u201cnot agree with this kind of approach.\u201d\n\nThe matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries.\n\nIn Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump\u2019s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans.\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNo hate, no fear,\u201d they added later. \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d\n\nSecurity fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill.\n\nSome Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,\u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d\n\nSome conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs\u2019 donor network. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive.\u201d\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and urged the president to \u201cmake appropriate revisions.\u201d Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts.\n\nMr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. \u201cThey are sadly weak on immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSenators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Peter Baker", "type": "article"}
