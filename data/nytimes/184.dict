{"title": "MoMA Takes a Stand: Art From Banned Countries Comes Center Stage", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/arts/design/moma-president-trump-travel-ban-art.html?mcubz=0", "text": "The Matisse gallery, where the masterworks \u201cDance\u201d and \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d hang, has been refitted with a large, intricate work on paper by the Iranian artist Charles Hossein Zenderoudi. In his \u201cMon P\u00e8re et Moi\u201d (1962), stylized gold hands and feet accompany jam-packed squares containing concentric circles and dancing glyphs. Are the two figures performing sujud, the act of prostrating oneself during Muslim prayer? They are too abstract to say with certainty. Like Matisse, Mr. Zenderoudi translated bodies into pure shapes, informed by patterns gleaned from the decorative arts.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn untitled canvas covered in dried, cracked earth, by Marcos Grigorian, who grew up in Iran, now hangs amid similarly geological works by Alberto Burri and Antoni T\u00e0pies. The gallery devoted to futurism has a small bronze totem by Parviz Tanavoli, one of Iran\u2019s foremost sculptors. (Mr. Tanavoli, who divides his time between Iran and Canada, was briefly detained last year by Iranian authorities.) Now, next to Henri Rousseau\u2019s \u201cThe Sleeping Gypsy\u201d is a painting by Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-born British architect who died last year.\n\nHadid\u2019s depiction of Hong Kong as an allover composition of interlocking shards satisfyingly fractures the gallery\u2019s timeline of art around 1900, and other works, too, are installed almost as intentional disruptions.\n\nA massive 2011 photograph of three billiard balls by Shirana Shahbazi \u2014 who has German citizenship but whose Iranian birth means she is now barred from this country \u2014 incongruously dominates the gallery devoted to Dada, right behind \u201cTo Be Looked At \u2026,\u201d Marcel Duchamp\u2019s impish painting on glass. Next to a large, Expressionist street scene by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, a 2007 video, \u201cChit Chat,\u201d by Tala Madani, who was born in Iran, plays on a loop. The frames of the stop-motion animation derive from bold, brushy compositions Ms. Madani paints and repaints. But where Kirchner depicts the streets of Dresden with a certain alienated distance, the video \u2014 depicting men grabbing each other by the throat and vomiting up yellow paint \u2014 is quietly urgent.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmerica\u2019s leading museums have been vocal in the past week about their opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which is still being enforced at some airports. James Cuno, who leads the Getty in Los Angeles, called the order \u201cill advised, unnecessary and destructive.\u201d Thomas P. Campbell, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggested that the blockbuster \u201cAssyria to Iberia\u201d might never have happened under Mr. Trump\u2019s rules. Artists have participated in protests, especially in Los Angeles, home to the largest Persian community in the United States. The order will also have a negative effect on arts journalism; Roxana Azimi, the arts correspondent for Le Monde, is no longer able to enter the United States, as she was born in Iran.\n\nBut the speed and directness with which MoMA \u2014 not an institution usually thought of as nimble \u2014 has responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s ban are especially impressive. Its particular force comes from the curators\u2019 decision to present these works on the fifth floor, in the galleries most steeped in MoMA\u2019s flowchart narrative of Modernist development. The Iranian, Iraqi and Sudanese art does not merely disrupt the old timeline of art history; it disrupts MoMA\u2019s own institutional character. It says: Even the room in which Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d hangs is not irreproachable, but rather a particular story told by individuals, who at times must speak out.\n\nThe institution, of course, has never been divorced from power and politics. (MoMA\u2019s continued sponsorship from Volkswagen \u2014 which admitted to installing illegal software in 11 million cars worldwide, resulting in more than $4.3 billion in fines \u2014 especially rankles.) But in the years to come, all institutions, from the most experimental to the most established, will have to decide whether to keep their heads down or whether to reply. This welcome new voice, less Olympian and more pluralistic, is not how MoMA has spoken in the past \u2014 but, then again, this is not how presidents have spoken in the past, either.", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Jason Farago", "type": "article"}
