Mr. Readler said a freeze on the United States refugee program had no effect on Hawaii.\n\nJudge Watson rejected that argument, preventing the administration from halting the flow of refugees.\n\nPhoto\n\nJudge Watson said in court that the government only argued for that narrower interpretation after a federal judge in Maryland blocked the six-nation travel ban but said it was not clear that the refugee suspension was similarly motivated by religious bias.\n\nThe judge noted that the government said 20 refugees were resettled in Hawaii since 2010.\n\n\u201cIs this a mathematical exercise that 20 isn\u2019t enough? ... What do I make of that?\u201d the judge asked Mr. Readler.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The imam of a Honolulu mosque joined the challenge, arguing that the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting family in Hawaii.\n\nIn his arguments, Mr. Chin quoted Mr. Trump\u2019s comments that the revised travel ban is a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the original. \u201cWe cannot fault the president for being politically incorrect, but we do fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,\u201d Mr. Chin said.\n\nEarlier this month, Judge Watson prevented the federal government from suspending new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and freezing the nation\u2019s refugee program. His ruling came just hours before the federal government planned to start enforcing Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nMr. Trump called Judge Watson\u2019s previous ruling an example of \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHawaii\u2019s ruling would not be directly affected by a decision siding with the federal government in the Maryland case, legal experts said. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set a hearing for May 8 to consider the administration\u2019s appeal.", "publish_date": "2017-03-29", "authors": "The Associated Press", "type": "article"}
