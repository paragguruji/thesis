Poroshenko of Ukraine) and the reassuring rituals of his old life (a round of golf at his club in nearby West Palm Beach).\n\nOn his first weekend here since being inaugurated, the Red Cross ball fell into the old-shoe category.\n\nHe had hosted the benefit several times over the past 20 years, said Dick Robinson, a friend and Palm Beach philanthropist, who stopped by to chat with the White House press corps, which now shows up alongside reporters from the local papers to chronicle events like this.\n\nThe sight of Mr. Trump lining up with his guests was remarkable, given that presidents normally enter a room only after everyone else is seated, and then often to the strains of \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned, clutching his wife\u2019s hand, he looked more like the glad-hander who spent years greeting the guests at his club.\n\nAnd yet there were myriad other signs of how Mr. Trump\u2019s life has changed, from the security checkpoint set up in an adjacent parking lot and the police boat that bobs in the Intracoastal Waterway to the Secret Service agents who peered into the crowd as he and Mrs. Trump shimmied to a band playing Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cOld Time Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bannon, which suggested that he was briefed regularly on the legal battle over his immigration order. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon both stayed at Mar-a-Lago, which has guest rooms.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven when Mr. Trump was off the clock, he appeared preoccupied by the world outside.\n\nOn Saturday morning, he began a Twitter tirade against the Seattle judge who had blocked the immigration order.\n\nThough he went quiet during the four and a half hours he was at the Trump International Golf Club \u2014 the White House declined to confirm that he actually played golf or say who his partners were \u2014 the Twitter posts resumed when he got back to the house.\n\nEven as his guests were mingling during cocktails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interest at heart. Bad people are very happy!\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump bought Mar-a-Lago at a fire-sale price in 1985, he was viewed by many in this uppity enclave as a parvenu who would cheapen the legacy of the estate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose days are gone \u2014 especially now that he has the power to make his friends ambassadors to European capitals.\n\nBut Mr. Trump still draws his share of catcalls \u2014 some subtle, others not.\n\nAcross the street from his golf club, the Palm Beach County Library had a sign in the front door advertising an evening with Amy Sherman, a reporter from The Miami Herald and PolitiFact Florida, to discuss how to expose disingenuous political figures. \u201cPants on Fire: How to Fact-Check Politicians,\u201d it said.\n\nOn Saturday, about 3,000 demonstrators marched along Flagler Drive, carrying signs and chanting, \u201cHey-hey, ho-ho, Donald Trump has got to go.\u201d\n\nAbout 300 managed to walk across the bridge to Palm Beach, according to The Palm Beach Post, where they got within 25 yards of Mar-a-Lago before encountering an armored security vehicle.\n\nAt 8 p.m., when the fireworks exploded above the estate, they cast a glow on the crowd, witnesses said, giving them a better view of the show than the one enjoyed by the guests inside Mr. Trump\u2019s winter White House.", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": "Mark Landler", "type": "article"}
