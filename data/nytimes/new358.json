I tried to humanize Muslim families, with my one-woman show, \u201cAll Atheists Are Muslim,\u201d sharing the story of moving in with my white atheist college boyfriend, and telling my parents about it. It\u2019s a typical boy meets girl story, up against thousands of years of cultural tradition and religious doctrine. The message the audience was meant to be left with was that if total nonbelievers and Muslims can find common ground, then everyone in between should be able to.\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of this worked. I saw firsthand that the fairy tale, mind-opening reaction that producers imagined was nowhere to be found. While mixed-race and interfaith couples often thanked me after my shows, many others let me know that I was one of the \u201cgood Muslims\u201d whom they didn\u2019t have a problem with. I hadn\u2019t made them more empathetic to Muslims as a whole.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Television producers, publishers and those booking events for college campuses all seem to want something similar: a representative of an \u201ceveryday\u201d Muslim (I still don\u2019t really know what that means) with an outlook relatable enough to get audiences to forget their bigotry. These pleas don\u2019t make me as sad as the ones that come from Muslim activists, who seem to be begging: Use your jokes to make us human; make us likable; let us prove to people that we\u2019re just like them.\n\nI do understand that comedy has some potential to open people\u2019s minds. But I\u2019ve become convinced that the primary role of political humor today shouldn\u2019t be to alleviate tensions or smooth out differences. It should be to heighten them and illuminate for everyone what is a moment of crisis. At the White House Correspondents Dinner a week ago, Hasan Minhaj showed us how funny and effective this can be. One highlight: \u201cAs a Muslim, I like to watch Fox News for the same reason I like to play \u2018Call of Duty\u2019: Sometimes I like to turn my brain off and watch strangers insult my family and heritage.\u201d\n\nOn occasion, I find this tension-heightening exhausting. I find myself reaching instead for stories divorced from a social agenda. Like how, as an immigrant kid, bringing home an A-minus in algebra meant my dad would look down on me with all the folds of disappointment on his face, as though to say, \u201cWe did not escape a revolution and swim the Atlantic Ocean and kiss the feet of the Statue of Liberty for you to get an A-minus in algebra. Our people invented algebra! You infidel!\u201d And if I ever got an A-plus, he\u2019d look just as disappointed and ask, \u201cWhy\u2019d you take such an easy class?\u201d\n\nI love pretending to do extreme sports just so that I can tag myself as an \u201cextreme Muslim\u201d on Instagram. I get a kick out of using my story to stick it to Muslims who think they\u2019re the only ones getting Islam right. I enjoy perplexing people who wonder how I can identify as bisexual and be married to a straight cisgender man, and how I can identify as Muslim while my husband is an atheist \u2014 and I eat pork. But I do this because these things are amusing to me, and because part of my job is exposing tensions and pointing out the absurd, not because I\u2019m trying to change minds.\n\nI\u2019m remembering the kind of comedian I was before the \u201cYou could be exactly what the country needs right now\u201d requests came rolling in. I\u2019m enjoying poking fun at myself and my idiosyncrasies \u2014 like the fact that my preferred method of self-care during stressful times is to watch the same five climate change documentaries in a row \u2014 even when it may make my audience realize I have less in common with them than they thought.\n\nIn some ways, by rejecting the persistent call to deliver \u201cWe\u2019re just like you\u201d comedy in Trump\u2019s America, I\u2019m finally asserting my right to be \u201cjust like\u201d any other comedian and, more important, just like myself.", "authors": ["Zahra Noorbakhsh"], "publish_date": "2017-05-06", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["comedians", "right", "watch", "job", "comedy", "mind", "york", "white", "algebra", "times", "open", "im", "muslim", "muslims"], "summary": "I tried to humanize Muslim families, with my one-woman show, \u201cAll Atheists Are Muslim,\u201d sharing the story of moving in with my white atheist college boyfriend, and telling my parents about it.\nI saw firsthand that the fairy tale, mind-opening reaction that producers imagined was nowhere to be found.\nSign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nAt the White House Correspondents Dinner a week ago, Hasan Minhaj showed us how funny and effective this can be."}
