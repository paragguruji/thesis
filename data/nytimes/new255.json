From his days at a public high school in Southern California, where he preached against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and liberalism and called in to conservative radio shows, to his time at Duke University, where he was known for controversial writings in the student newspaper and a failed attempt at a run for dorm president, he has delighted in challenging prevailing orthodoxies.\n\nAt a freshman mixer, recalled a college classmate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Miller announced, \u201cMy name is Stephen Miller, I am from Los Angeles, and I like guns.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller, known for his skinny ties, so-outdated-they\u2019re-chic pants and his recently abandoned chain-smoking habit, enjoyed a relatively turbulence-free ascent in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit until the travel ban. His eagerness to keep a tight lid on key details of executive orders to prevent leaks \u2014 as well as his inexperience \u2014 has at times hampered coordination between the West Wing and agencies that would have to carry them out, several White House officials said.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn part to deal with the confusion that surrounded the travel ban, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, recently created a 10-point protocol that requires all major executive actions to be cleared with the communications department and other senior White House staff members before implementation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Miller\u2019s peacock confidence has served him well with Mr. Trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when Mr. Miller helped bring Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, into the Trump fold.\n\nAfter the Republican National Convention in July, Mr. Miller became Mr. Trump\u2019s principal day-to-day speechwriter once the candidate had switched from handwritten notes to a teleprompter in the middle of the campaign.\n\nThe message in those speeches was so reflective of Mr. Trump\u2019s views that it earned Mr. Miller a spot as the warm-up act for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. His words became Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to build that wall, and we\u2019re going to build it out of love,\u201d Mr. Miller often said.\n\n\u201cSteve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in President Trump as a leader,\u201d said Jason Miller, who worked with him in the Trump campaign and is not related. \u201cSteve\u2019s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president\u2019s vision than almost anyone.\u201d\n\nIt is sometimes hard to tell Mr. Trump\u2019s voice from that of Mr. Miller, who suppressed his own orotund speech to capture the president\u2019s more visceral, off-the-cuff style. Not that he has had much choice: As one of three or four staff members to fly around with Mr. Trump during the last few months of the campaign, Mr. Miller was summoned to speechwriting tasks by a bark of \u201cReady!\u201d from Mr. Trump, who insisted on dictating practically every word \u2014 and laced into staff members who changed a word or inserted an overly complex policy point.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s flexibility as a speechwriter is offset by the consistent stridency of his political philosophy, which has remained much the same since he was the distinct minority at Santa Monica High School, a liberal outpost where he often railed against fellow students and the school administration. Mexican heritage celebrations and Iraq war protests were things of particular offense. He produced a 2003 essay, \u201cHow I Changed My Left Wing High School,\u201d that capped a high school career steeped in political activism.\n\nAt Duke, Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with Richard Spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university\u2019s Young Conservatives chapter.\n\nFrom there, it was straight to Capitol Hill, where Mr. Miller worked for Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and John Shadegg of Arizona before ending up with Mr. Sessions in 2009.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The bill passed the Senate easily in spite of Mr. Sessions\u2019s vociferous objections, but failed in the House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe knew we were taking on the establishment, and Steve was an incredibly hard worker and had no second thoughts about it,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in an interview.\n\nMr. Miller wrote many of the incendiary speeches that Mr. Sessions gave about the bill, including one in which he suggested that a Cuban-American aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been the author of a measure that he believed to be \u201camnesty\u201d in disguise.\n\nPhoto\n\nUltimately, it was Mr. Miller\u2019s dour views on illegal immigration that endeared him to Mr. Bannon and a small team of like-minded economic nationalists that included Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer. The group came together during the 2014 campaign of the far-right Republican candidate Dave Brat, whose upset win over the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a suburban Richmond, Va., district augured Mr. Trump\u2019s success.\n\nEven then, Mr. Miller had his eye on Mr. Trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012. Soon after Mr. Brat\u2019s victory in the Republican primary in July 2014, Mr. Miller sent his friends a Breitbart interview in which Mr. Trump declared, \u201cEverybody is vulnerable because what\u2019s happening in the country is very sad, and the world is watching.\u201d Mr. Miller added a comment: \u201cTrump gets it. I wish he\u2019d run for president.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon, Mr. Miller and the lesser-known head of the Domestic Policy Council, Andrew Bremberg, spent the later part of the transition period mapping out a shock-and-awe protocol of executive orders, sending more than 200 to federal agencies for review. The trouble came when they sent some of them to Obama-appointed officials at federal agencies for review, leading to leaks that prompted Mr. Miller to restrict the circulation of the plans.\n\nMr. Trump, initially pleased by the bold series of executive actions orchestrated by the team, was stung by the fallout from Mr. Miller\u2019s execution of the immigration order, and expressed frustration about not being fully briefed on an order reorganizing the National Security Council to give Mr. Bannon additional power.\n\nDespite the internal finger-pointing, Mr. Miller remains close to the still-powerful Mr. Bannon, who described him in an email as \u201ca loyal and faithful soldier in the Trump movement, a warrior for the working class.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Miller has been working on what is expected to be another contentious order: an as-yet-uncirculated rewriting of the guest worker program that is likely to impose new restrictions on the cheap foreign labor that Mr. Miller deplored in many of his 2013 emails, according to two officials familiar with their planning.\n\nMr. Miller, one of the officials said, is working closely with Department of Homeland Security aides to avoid a repeat of the travel ban fiasco.", "authors": ["Glenn Thrush", "Jennifer Steinhauer"], "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["republican", "true", "trump", "policies", "bannon", "sessions", "trumps", "school", "stephen", "miller", "believer", "white", "york", "mr", "core"], "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBut Mr. Miller\u2019s peacock confidence has served him well with Mr. Trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when Mr. Miller helped bring Mr.\nThe message in those speeches was so reflective of Mr. Trump\u2019s views that it earned Mr. Miller a spot as the warm-up act for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies.\nHis words became Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to build that wall, and we\u2019re going to build it out of love,\u201d Mr. Miller often said.\nEven then, Mr. Miller had his eye on Mr. Trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012.\nMr. Miller, one of the officials said, is working closely with Department of Homeland Security aides to avoid a repeat of the travel ban fiasco."}
