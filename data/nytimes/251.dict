Today, the Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn includes his works on its suggested reading list, and the leader of Jobbik, the Hungarian nationalist party, admires Evola and wrote an introduction to his works.\n\nMore important for the current American administration, Evola also caught on in the United States with leaders of the alt-right movement, which Mr. Bannon nurtured as the head of Breitbart News and then helped harness for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cJulius Evola is one of the most fascinating men of the 20th century,\u201d said Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader who is a top figure in the alt-right movement, which has attracted white supremacists, racists and anti-immigrant elements.\n\nIn the days after the election, Mr. Spencer led a Washington alt-right conference in chants of \u201cHail Trump!\u201d But he also invoked Evola\u2019s idea of a prehistoric and pre-Christian spirituality \u2014 referring to the awakening of whites, whom he called the Children of the Sun.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Spencer said \u201cit means a tremendous amount\u201d that Mr. Bannon was aware of Evola and other Traditionalist thinkers.\n\n\u201cEven if he hasn\u2019t fully imbibed them and been changed by them, he is at least open to them,\u201d he said. \u201cHe at least recognizes that they are there. That is a stark difference to the American conservative movement that either was ignorant of them or attempted to suppress them.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon, who did not return a request for comment for this article, is an avid and wide-ranging reader. He has spoken enthusiastically about everything from Sun Tzu\u2019s \u201cThe Art of War\u201d to \u201cThe Fourth Turning\u201d by William Strauss and Neil Howe, which sees history in cycles of cataclysmic and order-obliterating change. His awareness of and reference to Evola in itself only reflects that reading. But some on the alt-right consider Mr. Bannon a door through which Evola\u2019s ideas of a hierarchical society run by a spiritually superior caste can enter in a period of crisis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvolists view his ship as coming in,\u201d said Prof. Richard Drake at the University of Montana, who wrote about Evola in his book \u201cThe Revolutionary Mystique and Terrorism in Contemporary Italy.\u201d\n\nFor some of them, it has been a long time coming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that an adviser to the American president knows Evola, or maybe has a Traditionalist formation,\u201d said Gianfranco De Turris, an Evola biographer and apologist based in Rome who runs the Evola Foundation out of his apartment.\n\n\u201cIf Bannon has these ideas, we have to see how he influences the politics of Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nA March article titled \u201cAn Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide to the Alt-Right\u201d in Breitbart, the website then run by Mr. Bannon, included Evola as one of the thinkers in whose writings the \u201corigins of the alternative right\u201d could be found.\n\nThe article was co-written by Milo Yiannopoulos, the right-wing provocateur who is wildly popular with conservatives on college campuses. Mr. Trump recently defended Mr. Yiannopoulos as a symbol of free speech after demonstrators violently protested his planned speech at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe article celebrated the youthful internet trolls who give the alt-right movement its energy and who, motivated by a common and questionable sense of humor, use anti-Semitic and racially charged memes \u201cin typically juvenile but undeniably hysterical fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine them reading Evola,\u201d the article continued. \u201cThey may be inclined to sympathize to those causes, but mainly because it annoys the right people.\u201d\n\nEvola, who has more than annoyed people for nearly a century, seems to be having a moment.\n\n\u201cWhen I started working on Evola, you had to plow through Italian,\u201d said Mr. Sedgwick, who keeps track of Traditionalist movements and thought on his blog, Traditionalists. \u201cNow he\u2019s available in English, German, Russian, Serbian, Greek, Hungarian. First I saw Evola boom, and then I realized the number of people interested in that sort of idea was booming.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1898, Evola liked to call himself a baron and in later life sported a monocle in his left eye.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA brilliant student and talented artist, he came home after fighting in World War I and became a leading exponent in Italy of the Dada movement, which, like Evola, rejected the church and bourgeois institutions.\n\nEvola\u2019s early artistic endeavors gave way to his love of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and he developed a worldview with an overriding animosity toward the decadence of modernity. Influenced by mystical works and the occult, Evola began developing an idea of the individual\u2019s ability to transcend his reality and \u201cbe unconditionally whatever one wants.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead he preferred the Nazi SS officers, seeing in them something closer to a mythic ideal. They also shared his anti-Semitism.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bannon suggested in his Vatican remarks that the Fascist movement had come out of Evola\u2019s ideas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Mr. Bannon expounded on the intellectual motivations of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, he mentioned \u201cJulius Evola and different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what\u2019s called the Traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian Fascism.\u201d\n\nThe reality, historians say, is that Evola sought to \u201cinfiltrate and influence\u201d the Fascists, as Mr. Sedgwick put it, as a powerful vehicle to spread his ideas.\n\nIn his Vatican talk, Mr. Bannon suggested that although Mr. Putin represented a \u201ckleptocracy,\u201d the Russian president understood the existential danger posed by \u201ca potential new caliphate\u201d and the importance of using nationalism to stand up for traditional institutions.\n\n\u201cWe, the Judeo-Christian West,\u201d Mr. Bannon added, \u201creally have to look at what he\u2019s talking about as far as Traditionalism goes \u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Bannon suggested in his speech, Mr. Putin\u2019s most influential thinker is Aleksandr Dugin, the ultranationalist Russian Traditionalist and anti-liberal writer sometimes called \u201cPutin\u2019s Rasputin.\u201d\n\nAn intellectual descendant of Evola, Mr. Dugin has called for a \u201cgenuine, true, radically revolutionary, and consistent fascist fascism\u201d and advocated a geography-based theory of \u201cEurasianism\u201d \u2014 which has provided a philosophical framework for Mr. Putin\u2019s expansionism and meddling in Western European politics.\n\nMr. Dugin sees European Traditionalists as needing Russia, and Mr. Putin, to defend them from the onslaught of Western liberal democracy, individual liberty, and materialism \u2014 all Evolian b\u00eates noires.\n\nThis appeal of traditional values on populist voters and against out-of-touch elites, the \u201cPan-European Union\u201d and \u201ccentralized government in the United States,\u201d as Mr. Bannon put it, was not lost on Mr. Trump\u2019s ideological guru.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA lot of people that are Traditionalists,\u201d he said in his Vatican remarks, \u201care attracted to that.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Jason Horowitz", "type": "article"}
