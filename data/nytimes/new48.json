He said he hoped to be involved in the Trump administration but had engaged in no \u201cformal conversations\u201d with the president-elect\u2019s team.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not reply to a request for comment. That night, a CNN reporter wrote on Twitter that Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, had issued the following statement: \u201cPresident-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false. The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe, but the President-elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

McCaw, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights group, called the reference to internment camps as a precedent \u201cabsolutely deplorable\u201d and said that it would \u201creturn America to one of the darkest chapters of its history.\u201d\n\nMr. McCaw noted that Congress had formally apologized for the Japanese-American internment in a law signed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how it would now be right to do the same thing to Muslims,\u201d Mr. McCaw said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kobach, who is Kansas\u2019 secretary of state, was referring to the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which he helped create while working at the Justice Department. The program was first proposed in 2002, and significant portions of it were suspended nine years later. Mr. Kobach, who has degrees from Harvard, Oxford and Yale, had helped to create and carry out the system when he worked for Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n\nThe policy came under heavy criticism while it was in effect and afterward. In a 2012 report, the Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s law school called it a \u201ctool that allowed the government to systematically target Arabs, Middle Easterners, Muslims and South Asians\u201d and a \u201cclear example of discriminatory and arbitrary racial profiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin its first year of operation, the registration system resulted in the apprehension of numerous suspected terrorists,\u201d according to his Kansas government biography.\n\nThat program was not as broad or sweeping as the database of Muslim residents that Mr. Trump had said he would \u201ccertainly implement\u201d during the Republican primaries. He later backed off the idea after criticism.\n\nOn social media, many non-Muslims have reacted to Mr. Kobach\u2019s comments by saying that they will simply \u201cregister as Muslim.\u201d The official Twitter account of the Anti-Defamation League posted a statement from its chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, saying that \u201cif one day Muslims will be forced to register, that is the day that this proud Jew will register as a Muslim.\u201d\n\nThat seems unlikely to work; such a registry would apply only to visitors from certain countries.\n\nMr. McCaw, the spokesman for CAIR, said that the proposals advanced by Mr. Higbie and Mr. Kobach might seem to be different in degree, but that the two ideas \u2014 a database of names and internment camps based on religious or ethnic heritage \u2014 were inexorably linked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI really do feel as though the prospect of internment is always tied to registries of people,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Jonah Engel Bromwich"], "publish_date": "2016-11-18", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["mr", "spokesman", "trump", "day", "japanese", "comments", "mccaw", "kobach", "registry", "camps", "talk", "system", "internment", "muslim", "muslims", "fears", "raises"], "summary": "On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not reply to a request for comment.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Kobach declined to comment.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how it would now be right to do the same thing to Muslims,\u201d Mr. McCaw said.\nMr. Kobach, who has degrees from Harvard, Oxford and Yale, had helped to create and carry out the system when he worked for Attorney General John Ashcroft.\nThat program was not as broad or sweeping as the database of Muslim residents that Mr. Trump had said he would \u201ccertainly implement\u201d during the Republican primaries."}
