The president said the measures were necessary to counter terrorism.\n\nPhoto\n\nCourts blocked that first order, but the Supreme Court allowed parts of a revised version to go into effect, and the administration moved last week to close the American border to travelers from those six countries, as well as all refugees, unless they have close family in the country, or are coming to attend a university or accept a job offer.\n\nStill, many of the new citizens at Mount Vernon on Tuesday remained optimistic about their place in the country. Mr. Esmaeili pointed to the vocal protests against Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban earlier this year, explaining that he has found most Americans welcoming of outsiders.\n\n\u201cI believe in this system, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I believe that one person \u2014 even if it\u2019s the president \u2014 can\u2019t do everything he wants. The people are important,\u201d he said, looking forward to the next election in 2020.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to know that they made a mistake and they will re-elect someone more suited to America,\u201d he added.\n\nOthers taking the oath on Tuesday were more hesitant. Muhammad Tai, 29, moved to the United States five years ago from Pakistan. As a Muslim, he said, the turn in public sentiment against outsiders has made life difficult in recent months. As a pharmacist, Mr. Tai is concerned about the health care legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans last month, which he said would leave his customers with unaffordable bills.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Albright, the former secretary of state, and Albert Einstein, who also came from overseas.\n\nWatching the festivities quietly from the back of the lawn, Johnna Scepansky, 50, wiped tears streaming down past her sunglasses. She did not know anybody taking the oath on Tuesday but brought her husband and 4-year-old twin daughters to see the ceremony.\n\n\u201cThere is so much controversy about who should be here and who shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Scepansky said. \u201cI think anyone who wants to be here should be here,\u201d she said, adding that the most recent person in her family to migrate to the United States arrived some 200 years ago.\n\n\u201cI hate the vilification that\u2019s coming out on people who just want to be here and have the best possible lives for their family,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile those taking the oath celebrated their new citizenship, other migrants across the United States continue to struggle with the authorities.\n\nAs a custodian at Mount Vernon, Aracely Canales Ramos, 37, was busy on Tuesday keeping the restrooms, floors and windows sparkling. She moved to the United States from Honduras some 22 years ago and loves the festivities, fireworks and cake that come with the Fourth of July. But, she said, the process of gaining citizenship is difficult for hard-working outsiders like her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMaybe one day,\u201d she said, grinning.", "publish_date": "2017-07-04", "authors": "Avantika Chilkoti", "type": "article"}
