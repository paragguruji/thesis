As the family prepared to fly back home to get Naimma medical care, officials at the Iraqi airport reportedly told Hager that while he, an American citizen, could board the flight, his green-card carrying niece, nephews and mother would have to remain behind.\n\n\u201cI was just shocked,\u201d said Hager. \u201cI had to put my mom back on the wheelchair and take her back and call the ambulance, and she was very, very upset. She knew right there if we send her back to the hospital she\u2019s going to pass away \u2014 she\u2019s not going to make it.\u201d\n\nHager, who worked alongside special forces in Iraq between 2003 and 2008, said that his mother might have had a shot at surviving had he been able to get her to facilities in the U.S. If it weren\u2019t for Trump, Hager said, his mother might still be alive.\n\n\u201cI really believe this in my heart: If they would have let us in \u2026 she would have made it, and she would have been sitting right here next to me,\u201d Hager said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone because of him.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Fox News report published Wednesday, an imam of a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan has claimed that Hager\u2019s mother in fact died five days before Trump\u2019s executive order was put in place. Fox is reportedly trying to contact Hager for further details.\n\nRead the full story at New York Magazine.\n\nRelated:\n\nTrump fires acting attorney general who defied him on controversial travel ban\n\n4 women judges led the way in opposing Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s travel ban feels like it\u2019s \u2018keeping us safe\u2019 from an invented threat", "source": "Women in the World in Association with The New York Times - WITW", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "type": "article"}
