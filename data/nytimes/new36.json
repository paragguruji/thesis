Johnson, the first black president of Fisk University, who was called before the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee in 1949. In his testimony, he denied being a communist and defended the patriotism of African-Americans, who were accused of being anti-American for advocating civil rights.\n\nThe irony is that the room where his grandfather testified is now the same room where the House Homeland Security Committee meets, Mr. Johnson said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Trump, for his proposals to bar Muslims from entering the United States. The Khans lost their son, Humayun, an Army captain, while he was serving in Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Mr. Johnson\u2019s speech was greeted warmly, there were several small instances of protest. A few \u201cboos\u201d could be heard when Mr. Johnson entered to speak, and a couple of people held up a sign protesting the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s deportation policies.\n\nThe conference also featured a heated debate among several Muslim scholars and activists about the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s efforts to counter extremism and recruitment by groups like the Islamic State. Several panelists said the government\u2019s efforts focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities to the exclusion of white nationalist groups, which have been linked to several domestic terrorist attacks.\n\nGeorge Selim, who heads the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Community Partnerships, said the department worked to counter the spectrum of extremism, and that his office\u2019s work was done at the request of communities.\n\n\u201cWe focus on all forms of extremism,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the controversy over the programs to counter extremism, Mohamed Elsanousi, the director of the Washington office of the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers, said he welcomed Mr. Johnson\u2019s speech and the government\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cWe need to partner with the government to address the issues of radicalization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot fight this fight alone.\u201d", "authors": ["Ron Nixon"], "publish_date": "2016-09-05", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["bigotry", "room", "homeland", "extremism", "gathering", "speech", "securitys", "sign", "muslim", "department", "laments", "mr", "normalization", "johnson"], "summary": "The irony is that the room where his grandfather testified is now the same room where the House Homeland Security Committee meets, Mr. Johnson said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyAlthough Mr. Johnson\u2019s speech was greeted warmly, there were several small instances of protest.\nA few \u201cboos\u201d could be heard when Mr. Johnson entered to speak, and a couple of people held up a sign protesting the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s deportation policies.\nThe conference also featured a heated debate among several Muslim scholars and activists about the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s efforts to counter extremism and recruitment by groups like the Islamic State.\nSeveral panelists said the government\u2019s efforts focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities to the exclusion of white nationalist groups, which have been linked to several domestic terrorist attacks."}
