At Art Dubai, \u2018It\u2019s Plainly Wrong\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/autossell/proposed-travel-ban-at-art-dubai-its-plainly-wrong.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Most of the artists, curators and gallerists attending the art fair here were from predominantly Muslim countries. Many called the proposed ban xenophobic, and said it would lead to the cultural isolation of the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the booth of the Tehran-based Dastan\u2019s Basement gallery, Ashkan Zahraei, the assistant curator, wore his cap backward in a cluttered space designed to look like an artist\u2019s studio \u2014 filled with framed and unframed canvases, crates and wooden benches, and the suspended sculpture of a figure with wings.\n\n\u201cTo overgeneralize about a nation and say \u2018These people shouldn\u2019t come here\u2019 is plainly racist, and it\u2019s plainly wrong,\u201d said Mr. Zahraei, 28, who is from Iran, one of the countries included in the executive order. Mr. Zahraei, who was in San Francisco for an art fair in January, said that under the proposed ban it would be impossible for him to return to the United States.\n\nLaid out on the booth\u2019s central table was an unframed landscape painting by the artist Sam Samiee, 28, who lives in Amsterdam and Tehran. Mr. Samiee said that his planned collaboration with a filmmaker in Los Angeles \u2014 artist talks, installations and other projects \u2014 would be much harder if he could no longer go there.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Samiee said the ban would have a \u201ccastrating\u201d effect on the Western world. He described creative people like himself as the cultural agents of the West in Iran, \u201cbecause we hold these Western values in our works, and we have this Western way of living in Iran.\u201d\n\nHe said burning bridges made little sense: \u201cArt venues are always the place for fast diplomatic networking. If you just deprive yourself of seeing those people, your story will be so one-sided.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the fair was a large booth by the Ayyam Gallery, which was founded in Damascus in 2006 and is now based here. The booth featured a solo show by Sadik Kwaish Alfraji, an Iraqi multidisciplinary artist who has been based in the Netherlands since 1996, and now has Dutch citizenship.\n\nPhoto\n\nCovering the vast main wall was an old-fashioned-looking map of Baghdad made up of framed individual photogravures of the city\u2019s districts. Seen from a distance, the map, \u201cIn Search of Lost Baghdad\u201d (2017), has the overall shape of the bald and faceless male figure that Mr. Alfraji frequently uses to represent himself. A black bronze sculpture of that figure was also on display.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Alfraji said that the work related to his central theme: nostalgia for the Iraq of his youth. It represented \u201cthe fragmentation of a lost city,\u201d Baghdad, which he revisited in 2009 after more than 20 years of exile, and found to be \u201cthe same, yet not the same.\u201d\n\nAs for the proposed travel restrictions, which originally placed nationals of Iraq on the banned list but later removed them, Mr. Alfraji said he \u201cfelt pain,\u201d because it was unfair to target a country that had been destroyed by nearly three decades of war, sanctions and conflict, which he said the United States played a big role in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Samawi, who was born in Syria and is now a Swiss national, said that as a gallerist from the Middle East, she was disgusted by the idea of a travel ban.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a hostile environment against all Arabs,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think as a human being I should explain myself, especially if I\u2019m doing a positive thing. Our line of work is really about blending cultures.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-03-18", "authors": "Farah Nayeri", "type": "article"}
