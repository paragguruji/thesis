Chuang echoed that conclusion hours later, ruling in a case brought by nonprofit groups that work with refugees and immigrants, that the likely purpose of the executive order was \u201cthe effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban\u201d that Mr. Trump pledged to enact as a presidential candidate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump lashed out at Judge Watson during a campaign-style rally in Nashville late on Wednesday. Raising his voice to a hoarse shout, Mr. Trump accused the judge of ruling \u201cfor political reasons\u201d and criticized the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld the earlier decision against his administration and will hear any appeal to the Hawaii ruling.\n\n\u201cThis ruling makes us look weak, which by the way we no longer are, believe me,\u201d Mr. Trump said, to mounting cheers from a loyal crowd.\n\nMr. Trump even said he might reissue the initial version of the order, rather than the one blocked on Wednesday, which he described as \u201ca watered-down version of the first one.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter he signed the revised ban, Democratic attorneys general and nonprofit groups that work with immigrants and refugees raced back into court, claiming that Mr. Trump\u2019s updated decree was still a thinly veiled version of the ban on Muslim migration that he proposed last year.\n\nJudge Watson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, ruled that the State of Hawaii and an individual plaintiff, Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, had reasonable grounds to challenge the order as religious discrimination. And he concluded that allowing the travel restrictions to go into effect at midnight, as scheduled, could have caused them irreparable harm.\n\nJudge Watson flatly rejected the government\u2019s argument that a court would have to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cveiled psyche\u201d to deduce religious animus. He quoted extensively from the remarks by Mr. Trump that were cited in the lawsuit brought by Hawaii\u2019s attorney general, Doug Chin.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there is nothing \u2018veiled\u2019 about this press release,\u201d Judge Watson wrote, quoting a Trump campaign document titled \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nJudge Watson singled out Mr. Elshikh, an American citizen whose Syrian mother-in-law had been pursuing a visa to enter the United States, as having an especially strong claim that the travel regulations would harm him on the basis of his religion.\n\n\u201cThis is a great day for democracy, religious and human rights,\u201d Mr. Elshikh, who was out of the country, said in a message relayed through Hakim Ouansafi, the chairman of the Muslim Association of Hawaii. \u201cI am very pleased that the processing of my mother-in-law\u2019s paperwork will not stop now but more importantly that this Muslim ban will not separate families and loved ones just because they happen to be from the six countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Elshikh, who is Egyptian and previously worked in Michigan, was recruited to the Hawaii mosque more than a decade ago, Mr. Ouansafi said. And when the association began recruiting someone to serve as a plaintiff, the imam, who became a citizen last year, agreed to do so without reservation, Mr. Ouansafi said.\n\nAfter he became the face of the lawsuit, he received several threats from the mainland, Mr. Ouansafi said. \u201cIf we lived in any other state, I would not have asked him to come forward,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Maryland case, Judge Chuang, who was also appointed by Mr. Obama, declined to block the entire executive order from going into effect, but ruled that the most important section \u2014 banning travel from half a dozen countries \u2014 could not be enforced. His decision cited Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments to conclude that there were \u201cstrong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban,\u201d and that Mr. Trump may have intended to violate the constitutional prohibition on religious preferences.\n\nIn addition to the Hawaii and Maryland suits, a federal judge in Washington State heard arguments Wednesday in cases challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, including one brought by a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, and another by nonprofit groups.\n\nAdministration lawyers have argued that the president was merely exercising his national security powers. In the scramble to defend the executive order, a single lawyer in the United States solicitor general\u2019s office, Jeffrey Wall, argued first to a Maryland court and then, by phone, to Judge Watson in Honolulu that no element of the order, as written, could be construed as a religious test for travelers.\n\nMr. Wall said the order was based on concerns raised by the Obama administration in its move toward stricter screening of travelers from the six countries affected.\n\n\u201cWhat the order does is a step beyond what the previous administration did, but it\u2019s on the same basis,\u201d Mr. Wall said in the Maryland hearing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in Nashville, the Justice Department released a more muted statement disputing the Hawaii decision, calling it \u201cflawed both in reasoning and scope.\u201d Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the department, said it would continue to defend the legality of the presidential order.\n\nRefugee organizations and civil rights groups greeted the Hawaii ruling with expressions of triumph and relief. Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups that sued Mr. Trump in Maryland, hailed Judge Watson\u2019s ruling as \u201ca strong and unequivocal rejection of the politics of hate.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Issued abruptly on a Friday afternoon, it temporarily barred travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, making no explicit distinction between citizens of those countries who already had green cards or visas and those who did not. It also suggested that Christian refugees from those countries would be given preference in the future.\n\nAfter the federal court in Seattle issued a broad injunction against the policy, Mr. Trump removed major provisions and reissued the order. The new version exempted key groups, like green card and visa holders, and dropped the section that would have given Christians special treatment.\n\nMr. Trump also removed Iraq from the list of countries covered by the ban after the Pentagon expressed worry that it would damage the United States\u2019 relationship with the Iraqi government in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nYet those concessions did not placate critics of the ban, who said it would still function as an unconstitutional religious test, albeit one affecting fewer people \u2014 an argument Judge Watson concurred with in his ruling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lawsuits have also claimed that the order disrupts the operations of companies, charities, public universities and hospitals that have deep relationships overseas. In the Hawaii case, nearly five dozen technology companies, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Lyft and TripAdvisor, joined in a brief objecting to the travel ban.\n\nThe second, now-halted executive order preserved major components of the original. It would have ended, with few exceptions, the granting of new visas and green cards to people from six majority-Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 for at least 90 days. It would have also stopped all refugees from entering for 120 days and limited refugee admissions to 50,000 people in the current fiscal year.\n\nMr. Obama had set in motion plans to admit more than twice that number.\n\nMr. Trump has said the pause is needed to re-evaluate screening procedures for immigrants from the six countries. \u201cEach of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones,\u201d he wrote in the order.\n\nThe two court orders were not a final ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban, and the administration has expressed confidence that courts will ultimately affirm Mr. Trump\u2019s power to issue the restrictions.\n\nVideo\n\nBut the legal debate is likely to be a protracted and unusually personal fight for the administration, touching Mr. Trump and a number of his key aides directly and raising the prospect that their public comments and private communications will be scrutinized.\n\nThe lawsuits against the ban have extensively cited Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during the presidential campaign. Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington, who successfully challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s first order, has indicated that in an extended legal fight, he could seek depositions from administration officials and request documents that would expose the full process by which Trump aides crafted the ban.\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump first proposed to bar all Muslims from entering the United States, and then offered an alternative plan to ban travel from a number of Muslim countries, which he described as a politically acceptable way of achieving the same goal.\n\nThe lawsuits also cited Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who advises Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani said he had been asked to help craft a Muslim ban that would pass legal muster.\n\nAnd they highlighted comments by Stephen Miller, an adviser to the president, who cast the changes to Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban as mere technical adjustments aimed at ushering the same policy past the review of a court.", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "authors": "Alexander Burns", "type": "article"}
