We asked them about their experiences as religious and cultural minorities, including their feelings of being discriminated against on the basis of their religion. We also asked how they managed their dual identities as Americans and Muslims, and how they felt toward fundamentalist Islamic groups and extremist causes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In turn, this loss of meaning was associated with greater support for fundamentalist groups and extremist causes.\n\nThis finding was consistent with research by the social psychologist Arie Kruglanski that showed that the psychological need for significance, not religion or ideology, is what propels people toward extremism. Extremist groups offer a sense of purpose, certainty and belonging to those who work on their behalf.\n\nThese groups go after Muslims who feel culturally homeless, leaning heavily on the claim that the West is anti-Islam. In this context, Mr. Trump\u2019s original ban, which sent a strong message that Muslims were not welcome in this country and could not be \u201creal\u201d Americans, amounted to free propaganda for extremists. As one poster argued on a pro-Islamic State web channel, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the declared leader of the Islamic State, should consider Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order a \u201cblessed ban.\u201d\n\nThe good news from our study was that the overwhelming majority of our participants reported that they wanted to integrate aspects of American culture and their cultural heritage into their own identities. In addition, overall support for extremism was very low. A Trump administration that wants to build a more secure nation would look to integration, not alienation, as the goal for America\u2019s Muslims.\n\nThe one welcome result of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban was that it prompted non-Muslim activists to come out in force throughout the country \u2014 from Washington to Dallas to Los Angeles \u2014 to show solidarity with those affected. Rallying at airports and city centers, these protesters countered Mr. Trump\u2019s Islamophobic language with the message that Muslims are welcome and an important part of America\u2019s cultural fabric. It is precisely this kind of sentiment that we need to hear expressed by our leaders.\n\nThe exact nature of the revised version of the executive order, which Mr. Trump said he would issue soon, is unknown. In the meantime, the judicial and legislative branches of the government should take a look at the social science showing why Islamophobic policies pose a genuine threat to Americans of all cultural backgrounds and faiths.", "publish_date": "2017-02-18", "authors": "Sarah Lyons-Padilla and Michele J.
