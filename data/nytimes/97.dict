Others had joined as a way of countering Mr. Trump \u2014 just a few of the many Americans, of varied backgrounds, reacting with shock, outrage and concern to his curtailment of the country\u2019s long-established refugee resettlement system.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe Statue of Liberty has always been our symbol of welcome,\u201d Rabbi Steven Stark Lowenstein, the group\u2019s leader, said at the airport. \u201cIt feels like Trump turned off the light,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Pentagon on Friday, the preparations for the president\u2019s actions were orderly: High-level officials gathered in a room called the Hall of Heroes, and photographers assembled. But around the country, refugees, resettlement workers and volunteers expressed panic. Resettlement workers did not know if they would have jobs once Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration plans have been fully carried out. Volunteers wondered what they would do with furniture and money they had collected for refugees who were supposed to arrive soon.\n\nRefugeeOne, the resettlement agency responsible for the family coming into O\u2019Hare, had been expecting another Syrian family to arrive on Monday.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Kim Snoddy, the program\u2019s liaison to groups like the Am Shalom volunteers, said as she waited with them at the airport on Friday.\n\nA volunteer from another Chicago group posted a photograph on Facebook of an empty crib, made up with a pink sheet and a stuffed bunny, for the baby of a family that would no longer arrive.\n\nResettlement workers and volunteers across the country said that since Election Day, Americans of diverse backgrounds had been lining up to aid refugees, channeling their opposition to Mr. Trump into a desire to help vulnerable newcomers. Sloane Davidson, 37, a graduate student in Pittsburgh, hosted refugees for Thanksgiving dinner and said she was so moved by the experience that she took a job as a case aide at a local agency.\n\n\u201cThe more I learned about what I felt to be the truth and the truth that Trump was telling,\u201d the more she wanted to get involved, she wrote in an email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResettlement agencies said that volunteers had been swarming their offices and that even more had surfaced last week when Mr. Trump\u2019s specific plans became public. When the International Refugee Assistance Project put out a call for lawyers to help new arrivals in danger of being turned away, it received 3,000 volunteers in four hours, said Becca Heller, the organization\u2019s director.\n\n\u201cPeople are desperate to help refugees as a way to counter these discriminatory policies,\u201d she said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nAs the minutes passed at O\u2019Hare, the volunteers checked the time again, tense with the knowledge that Mr. Trump was about to commit pen to paper. The family they were awaiting had flown into Washington the night before, meaning they had cleared immigration with less than a day to spare. But the volunteers said they would not be able to exhale until the newcomers landed in Chicago. The flight was delayed, they heard. They glanced at the time on their phones again.\n\nAs soon as the Syrian family of four stepped into the baggage claim area, the synagogue members surrounded them protectively, offering the flowers and signs, as a resettlement worker translated. Because they spoke no English, the newcomers wore tags around their necks, like Paddington Bear, so if they got lost, they could be identified.\n\nIn a moment, the two Syrian children\u2019s arms were laden with gift bags of toys. The parents said they were too terrified to talk to a reporter, out of concern for family members \u2014 some still trapped in dangerous areas of Syria and others who had been cleared to travel to the United States but had not yet received plane tickets.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The refugees headed to their new home with a few escorts, the synagogue members back to their far more stable lives. Just before they parted, Rabbi Lowenstein gathered his congregants and gave them a charge.\n\n\u201cIf this is the last group of refugees to get in, we will show them the best of America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe family was driven to its new home, where a meal and a Syrian-style semolina cake were waiting. The couple said they had not checked the news since landing in the United States, and no one from the volunteer group had told them what was about to happen. Moments before they arrived at the cozy, fully stocked apartment, Mr. Trump, wearing an American flag pin, signed the orders in front of an audience of his advisers and Pentagon officials. As he finished, the clapping in the room was loud.\n\nBehind him hung an oversize medal depicting the Statue of Liberty, a beacon of welcome.", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Jodi Kantor", "type": "article"}
