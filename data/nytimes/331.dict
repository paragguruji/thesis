Yet through every planned line of attack \u2014 from his record on workers\u2019 rights to his skepticism of the power of regulatory agencies \u2014 Judge Gorsuch emerged with few scratches.\n\nVideo\n\nIn response to questions from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, Judge Gorsuch expressed admiration for Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the same Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nHe is \u201can outstanding judge,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said.\n\n\u201cWhenever I see his name attached to an opinion, it\u2019s one I read with special care,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said.\n\nBut he refused to say whether Senate Republicans had mistreated Judge Garland by refusing to consider his nomination for the better part of a year.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get involved in politics,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said. \u201cThere\u2019s judicial canons that prevent me from doing that. And I think it would be very imprudent of judges to start commenting on political disputes.\u201d\n\nMr. Leahy had no such qualms. \u201cI think it was shameful,\u201d he said of the Republicans\u2019 gambit. \u201cI think it has severely damaged the reputation of the committee. I think it has severely damaged the reputation of the senators who concurred with that.\u201d\n\nOn other questions, Judge Gorsuch was less reserved. He did not hesitate, for instance, when asked to declare his independence from Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, instructed him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a softball, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said. \u201cI have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts and the particular case require.\u201d\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would seek to appoint justices ready to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut Judge Gorsuch said that no one from the White House asked him to make any commitments on legal issues that could come before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI have offered no promises on how I\u2019d rule in any case to anyone,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter who\u2019s doing the asking.\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked Judge Gorsuch how he would have responded had Mr. Trump asked him to vote to overrule Roe during his interview at Trump Tower.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSenator, I would have walked out the door,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said.\n\nAsked about Roe and countless other Supreme Court decisions, Judge Gorsuch responded with variations on a theme. The rulings were entitled to respect as precedents of the Supreme Court, he said, and should not be overturned lightly.\n\n\u201cIf I were to start telling you which are my favorite precedents or which are my least favorite precedents or if I view a precedent in that fashion,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said, \u201cI would be tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I\u2019ve already made up my mind about their cases.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans largely used their questioning to help insulate Judge Gorsuch from expected criticism, offering 30-minute safe harbors. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was perhaps the most creative, coaxing Judge Gorsuch to hold forth on \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy,\u201d judicial basketball games and the rodeo practice of \u201cmutton busting.\u201d\n\nAnd for Democrats still straining to determine how aggressively to counter Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, the proceedings on Tuesday offered little help. At times, after fits of effective sidestepping from the nominee, they paused for several seconds to regroup, looking through their notes anew.\n\nEfforts to make the hearings a referendum, in part, on Mr. Trump himself also faltered.\n\nMr. Leahy pressed Judge Gorsuch on Mr. Trump\u2019s order banning travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cSenator, that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s currently being litigated actively, as you know,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said, declining to weigh in.\n\nMr. Leahy said that some Republicans had argued that a rapid confirmation for Judge Gorsuch could represent the administration\u2019s best chance of winning a case on this issue before the Supreme Court.", "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "authors": "Adam Liptak and Matt Flegenheimer", "type": "article"}
