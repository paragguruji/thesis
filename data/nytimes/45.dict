He could proceed with what he once called a ban on Muslims\u2019 entering the country, but later amended \u2013 after being accused of racism \u2013 to a ban on visitors from a list of troubled nations, almost all of which are Muslim-majority.\n\nHe would pull back the troops that the United States has stationed around the world to keep the peace \u2013 unless America is paid for the protection. He would tell NATO that the United States will live up to its post-World War II security commitments only if other nations first pay their fair share. He repeatedly dismissed the idea that those forward deployments are in America\u2019s own interests, that they prevent Chinese or Russian adventurism and keep open the trade routes for American goods.\n\nAs the president-elect, Mr. Trump will soon be briefed on how to use America\u2019s nuclear codes \u2013 the codes Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama said he could never be trusted to hold. And within the first year of his presidency, it should become clear whether Mr. Trump meant it when he said that he was comfortable with the thought that Japan and South Korea, both signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, might abandon its longtime commitment and build weapons of their own.\n\nIf the United States \u201ckeeps on its path, its current path of weakness, they\u2019re going to want to have that anyway, with or without me discussing it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nPerhaps the most unpredictable matter is how Mr. Trump will deal with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom he has repeatedly praised in terms that shocked even his own party. Would he lift the sanctions over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u2013 a move that Mr. Trump seemed to suggest was justified \u2013 and its harassment of Ukraine? Would he back off from the Obama administration\u2019s decision to bolster the American military presence off Russia\u2019s borders?\n\nThere has been a growing bipartisan consensus in the foreign policy and intelligence leadership that Russia must be both constrained and contained, its harassment of the new members of NATO halted, its cyberattacks deterred. But Mr. Trump never once argued for Russian containment \u2013 once a staple of his party\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 and repeatedly argued that he, and he alone, could negotiate with authoritarians like Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cMy administration,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwill work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS, and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And that includes Russia.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Putin seemed to return that sentiment, sensing his opportunity and saying he looked forward to restoring \u201cfully fledged\u201d relations with the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump dismissed Russia\u2019s human rights violations, its jailing of journalists and political opponents, its rigged elections. He would measure the country, he said, solely by its willingness to chip into American projects.\n\n\u201cIf they want to join us by knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very imperfect world, and you can\u2019t always choose your friends. But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Since the late 1980s, he has nurtured a set of preoccupations, chiefly that America\u2019s allies \u2013 Japan and Saudi Arabia among them \u2013 are ripping America off. He maintained that position even as Japan faded from the scene as a major world power and as Saudi Arabia emerged as one of America\u2019s most critical allies in a region of the world where Mr. Trump sees little reason for the United States to remain.\n\nIn an interview in March, he had no compunction about threatening the kingdom\u2019s survivability. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a 100-minute conversation, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be around.\u201d\n\nThe mystery is how much of that kind of talk arises from deeply held beliefs, and how much is an opening bid by the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sees himself as a dealer, a negotiator who knows that you get nowhere unless you threaten,\u201d said Graham Allison, a longtime Harvard professor who has begun a new project in \u201capplied history,\u201d taking lessons from past moments to inform America\u2019s current strategic choices.\n\nIndeed, the world is about to discover whether the most outlandish promises Mr. Trump made in his campaign about rethinking the international order \u2013 thoughts that often seemed at best off the cuff \u2013 are about to become reality.\n\nFinancial markets abroad panicked on Tuesday night, fearful that a Trump presidency would instantly send the country into uncertain economic territory that investors had discounted as wholly improbable just 24 hours ago. But there was a far more mild decline as Wall Street opened, suggesting that investors here saw other possibilities. Mr. Trump, who never argued with the notion that he is a protectionist, time and again vowed to punish companies that move jobs abroad, a task that would begin with the abolishment of Nafta, the trade agreement that once was envisioned, by President Bill Clinton, as the first step unifying the Western Hemisphere. To Mr. Trump, it is \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump vision, in fact, is an America unbound by a half-century of trade deals, free to pursue a nationalistic approach in which success is measured not by the quality of its alliances but the economic return on its transactions. \u201cWe will not be ripped off anymore,\u201d he said in the interview in March. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be friendly with everybody, but we\u2019re not going to be taken advantage of by anybody.\u201d\n\nHe bristled at the suggestion that his wall-building, trade-deal-canceling views would take America back to an era of isolationism, arguing that he was simply freeing the United States from the binds of international rules that are not in the nation\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cNot isolationist, but I am America first,\u201d he said when he was asked whether his own policies had echoes of the movement by the same name championed by Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s.\n\n\u201cI like the expression,\u201d he said of \u201cAmerica first.\u201d From that moment on, he began using it at his rallies, and it became the stuff of bumper stickers and chants.\n\nHe is also unabashedly business first, and that extends to his tax proposals, which also leave the markets deeply uncertain.\n\nStarting with the day he descended the long escalator in Trump Tower in June 2015 to begin a quest almost no one thought would succeed, Mr. Trump laid out an agenda of tax cuts \u2013 modest for families, and sharp for businesses \u2013 that he argued would be the stimulus a sluggish economy needs.\n\nBut he also paired those cuts with a major plan to rebuild America\u2019s dilapidated airports and collapsing bridges, with $137 billion in federal tax credits as an incentive for private industry to spend upward of a trillion more. While privatization is hardly a new idea, Mr. Trump has described an approach few have ever tried before \u2013 and it is far from clear how it would work. Presumably, users of that infrastructure would ultimately pay for it, in tolls and usage taxes, through a mechanism few understand.\n\nNo one knows how much of this agenda, largely thrown together rather than the product of deep study and debate, is for real. His policy office in Washington, created to lay out the position-papers common to most campaigns, was gradually disbanded. He is famously volatile, capable of changing his mind in an instant if he sees new avenues for profit, all the while denying he had ever suggested another path.\n\nIn Mr. Trump, Professor Allison sees a revolution in approach reminiscent of the 1828 election of Andrew Jackson, another populist who rode to power rebelling against what amounted to America\u2019s first Establishment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy God,\u201d Professor Allison said on Tuesday night, as the results veered toward Mr. Trump. \u201cWe are in a strange new land.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-11-10", "authors": "David E.
