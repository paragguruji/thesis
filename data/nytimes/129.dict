This is the man who claimed he\u2019d run government like a business and vaunted his management expertise. Only now do we ruefully understand he was apparently referring to his one-man-in-charge Trump enterprise and not the well-run American companies viewed as exemplars of sound management.\n\nBy blindsiding so many stakeholders, from travelers in the air to immigration officers to Congress to entire countries, President Trump makes it appear that his purpose was primarily to portray himself as a man of action getting his way by fiat. That\u2019s hardly the way to run a democratic government that works efficiently and effectively for its citizens.\n\nPAT POSTON\n\nKings Mountain, N.C.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cTrashing America\u2019s Ideals and Security\u201d (editorial, Jan. 30):\n\nWhat was the rush?

Was there reason to think we were in imminent danger? Not that we have heard! Mr. Trump just used his pen to upend lives and give great P.R. to jihadist recruiters who have been saying all along that the United States is at war with Islam.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCAROL F. ROYE\n\nPleasantville, N.Y.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI am surprised by the negative reaction to President Trump\u2019s ban on travel and immigration from countries with ties to terrorism. Of course, it is inevitable that there will be those travelers who will be caught in the cross hairs of an order for which they were not prepared. Nonetheless, every country has the right to protect itself, and right now the United States must effectively deal with the growing threats of terrorism from the countries on the ban list. This situation requires a different policy than our peacetime protocol for welcoming immigrants and visitors.", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Disorder and the Immigration Order"}
