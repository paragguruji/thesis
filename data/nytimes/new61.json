Cohen, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University who worked for President George W. Bush and has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the fun phase now,\u201d Mr. Cohen added, \u201cbut they\u2019re in for a whole bunch of rude awakenings.\u201d\n\nOne area where Mr. Trump and his advisers have been unswerving is their repeated denunciation of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Zelikow, who served in the administrations of both Presidents Bush and now teaches at the University of Virginia, said there were three guiding themes in Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy: economic nationalism, a war against \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and a \u201cdeliberate aloofness\u201d toward the actions of other countries \u2014 for example, Russia. \u201cBeyond that,\u201d Mr. Zelikow said, \u201cthere is an ambient prickliness. We could end up picking fights with three-quarters of the world.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, met with a delegation of generals and admirals from the Pentagon\u2019s joint staff at the president-elect\u2019s Palm Beach club. A day earlier, Mr. Flynn met in Washington with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees for secretary of defense, Gen. James N. Mattis; secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson; and secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly.\n\nThe military officers at the meeting focus mostly on the acquisition of equipment, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, whose costs Mr. Trump recently complained had spiraled \u201cout of control.\u201d This suggests that his first major Pentagon briefing was about hardware and budgets, not military operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvisers to Mr. Trump did not discuss the meetings or say how he planned to respond to the attack in Germany, as well as ones in Turkey and Switzerland. In a Twitter post on Monday, the president-elect said that terrorism was \u201cgetting worse\u201d and that \u201cthe civilized world must change thinking!\u201d\n\nThat has left analysts to pore over Mr. Trump\u2019s recent pronouncements to figure out how they might alter the policy followed by the Obama administration. His call for safe zones, which he made during a rally in Hershey, Pa., last week, suggested to some that he would seek a more activist role in Syria, probably working with Russia, which has had an antagonistic relationship with President Obama.\n\n\u201cWhy is he saying this?\u201d asked Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Referring to Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, he said, \u201cThe answer is, he\u2019s getting briefings that show that Bashar Assad is so depleted in manpower that it will take years, not months, for him to reconquer his territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that he said that says to me that he recognizes that Syria is going to be a divided country,\u201d Mr. Tabler said.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump sent mixed messages on Syria. He called for the creation of \u201ca big, beautiful safe zone\u201d in the country to stem the tide of refugees from Syria to Europe. But he also said the United States should resist getting drawn into the grinding conflict against Mr. Assad because the real enemy was the Islamic State.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton, his opponent, called for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Syria, Mr. Trump warned that it could lead to \u201cWorld War III\u201d with Russia. Analysts point out, however, that securing a safe zone would probably require some kind of a no-fly zone. They also said it was not clear why a gulf nation like Saudi Arabia would agree to deploy troops or pay for such a zone.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

His initial Twitter post, \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters \u2014 rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act,\u201d suggested he viewed it as a grave affront.\n\nBut after the Chinese agreed to return the submersible drone to a Navy ship off the Philippines, he wrote, \u201cWe should tell China that we don\u2019t want the drone they stole back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response, by contrast, was so muted that some analysts in the region worried that it might embolden China to act more boldly in the South China Sea. Some speculated that the Chinese were twitting Mr. Trump after his own provocative actions toward them.\n\nMr. Trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan this month \u2014 the first such leader-to-leader exchange between Taiwan and the United States in nearly four decades \u2014 and declared that he viewed the \u201cOne China\u201d policy as a bargaining chip with Beijing.\n\nMr. Obama said in a news conference last week: \u201cThe idea of \u2018One China\u2019 is at the heart of their conception as a nation. And so, if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through the consequences, because the Chinese will not treat it the way they\u2019ll treat some other issues.\u201d", "authors": ["Mark Landler"], "publish_date": "2016-12-21", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["affirms", "trump", "bar", "policy", "suggests", "plan", "china", "zone", "united", "syria", "trumps", "berlin", "states", "president", "muslims", "mr", "attack"], "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAdvisers to Mr. Trump did not discuss the meetings or say how he planned to respond to the attack in Germany, as well as ones in Turkey and Switzerland.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump sent mixed messages on Syria.\nWhen Hillary Clinton, his opponent, called for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Syria, Mr. Trump warned that it could lead to \u201cWorld War III\u201d with Russia.\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of the drone episode with China was similarly inconsistent.\nSome speculated that the Chinese were twitting Mr. Trump after his own provocative actions toward them."}
