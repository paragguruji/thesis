President Trump, despite the oath he swore just a few weeks ago, has demonstrated once again that he disdains the Constitution and the rule of law if they conflict with what he wants to do.\n\nI doubt that he actually read the carefully reasoned opinion that he called \u201cridiculous.\u201d And calling Judge James Robart, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, a \u201cso-called judge\u201d (front page, Feb. 5) is both puerile and disrespectful.\n\nClearly, President Trump intends to bully the courts in the same way that he bullies anyone else who dares to disagree with him.
