{"title": "Trump to Order Mexican Border Wall and Curtail Immigration", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Mr. Trump is also expected to target legal immigrants as early as this week, White House officials said, by halting a decades-old program that grants refuge to the world\u2019s most vulnerable people as he begins the process of drastically curtailing it and enhancing screening procedures.\n\nIn the draft of a separate executive order now being circulated inside the administration, Mr. Trump would examine the question of whether the Central Intelligence Agency should reopen its so-called black sites, secret interrogation and detention centers that it operated overseas. Former President Barack Obama ordered the closings of all in the first week of his presidency in 2009.\n\nThe black sites were a highly classified program, so their mention in an executive order would be highly unusual.\n\nThe draft of a second executive order would also order a review of the Army Field Manual to determine whether to use certain enhanced interrogation techniques.\n\nAnother executive order under consideration would direct the secretary of state to determine whether to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization. That designation has been sought by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe refugee policy under consideration would halt admissions from Syria and suspend it from other majority-Muslim nations until the administration can study how to properly vet them. This would pave the way for the administration to slash the number of displaced people who can be resettled on American soil, and would effectively bar the entry of people from Muslim countries \u2014 including Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria \u2014 at least for some time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe plan is in line with a ban on Muslim immigrants that Mr. Trump proposed during his campaign, arguing that such a step was warranted given concerns about terrorism. He later said he wanted to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of refugees from Syria and other countries where terrorism was rampant, although the Obama administration had already instituted strict screening procedures for Syrian refugees that were designed to weed out anyone who posed a danger.\n\nThe expected actions drew strong criticism from immigrant advocates and human rights groups, which called them discriminatory moves that rejected the American tradition of welcoming immigrants of all backgrounds.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Congress would need to approve any new funding necessary to build the wall, which Mr. Trump has insisted Mexico will finance, despite its leaders\u2019 protestations to the contrary. The order would shift already appropriated federal funds to the wall\u2019s construction, but it was unclear where the money would come from.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has estimated that it could cost $6.5 million per mile to build a single-layer fence, and an additional $4.2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall.\n\nMr. Trump has said immigration will be on the agenda when he meets with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\nThe order to build the wall is likely to complicate the visit of Mr. Videgaray, who has a history with Mr. Trump. It was Mr. Videgaray, then Mexico\u2019s finance minister, who orchestrated Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico before the election, a move seen by many Mexicans as tantamount to treason. He was forced to resign because of the fallout, but his reputation was restored after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and he was given the job of foreign minister, in part to capitalize on his relationship with the new American leader.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mexican officials were informed of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to sign the executive order during Mr. Videgaray\u2019s visit.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s refugee directive is expected to target a program the Obama administration expanded last year in response to a global refugee crisis, fueled in large part by a large flow of Syrians fleeing their country\u2019s civil war. Mr. Obama increased the overall number of refugees to be resettled in the United States to 85,000 and ordered that 10,000 of the slots be reserved for Syrians. He set the number of refugees to be resettled this year at 110,000, more than double the 50,000 Mr. Trump is now considering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the end of last month, more than 25,000 refugees had been resettled, according to State Department figures, meaning the plan Mr. Trump is considering would admit only 25,000 more by the end of September.", "publish_date": "2017-01-24", "authors": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis, David E.
