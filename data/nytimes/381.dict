{"title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s Options in the Travel Ban Case", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/us/politics/travel-ban-supreme-court-trump.html?mcubz=0", "text": "The administration also made two interim requests, asking the court to stay two rulings blocking parts of the travel ban. Granting the stays would revive the ban while the justices decide how to respond to the petition. It takes five votes to grant a stay.\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court likely to do?\n\nThe court will probably agree to hear the appeal. When a major presidential initiative is ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court, a review by the Supreme Court almost always follows.\n\nThe stay applications present harder questions, and how the court answers them will have important practical consequences.\n\nThe court typically moves quickly on requests for stays, often acting in about a week. Under its usual practices, it would not hear arguments on the applications and would issue brief orders announcing the outcome with little or no legal reasoning.\n\nIf the court grants the requests, the travel ban will go back into effect and probably expire before the court hears arguments on the merits of the appeal. That could make the case moot.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

It says the move is justified by the need to keep the nation safe, and it says presidents have almost unlimited discretion to make national security judgments and to control immigration.\n\nPeople and groups challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order say it was a product of religious intolerance and the culmination of his campaign pledges to institute a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d They say that violates the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, and several courts have agreed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its brief urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, the Justice Department said the case was momentous.\n\n\u201cThis order has been the subject of passionate political debate,\u201d the brief said. \u201cBut whatever one\u2019s views, the precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s national security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order, and this constitutional moment.\u201d\n\nKaren Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said lower courts had been right to reject Mr. Trump\u2019s order. \u201cAgain and again, our nation\u2019s courts have found that President Trump\u2019s Muslim ban is unconstitutional,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to defend our plaintiffs\u2019 right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe case thus presents the Supreme Court with the opportunity to issue a major constitutional ruling on the scope of presidential power. But there are procedural wrinkles, and it is possible that the case will be resolved without a formal ruling.\n\nWhat have the trial courts done?\n\nFederal judges in Maryland and Hawaii have blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, issued in March. The Maryland ruling was narrower, freezing only the order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The suspension was needed, the executive order said, to allow the government to conduct a review of its vetting procedures.\n\nThe Hawaii ruling also blocked the order\u2019s suspension of the nation\u2019s refugee program. More important, it appeared to prohibit the government from completing its 90-day internal review process.\n\nThat part of the Hawaii ruling may turn out to be very important. If it is lifted, the travel ban could expire before the Supreme Court has a chance to issue a definitive ruling.\n\nMark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard, has urged the Supreme Court to focus on the Hawaii ruling.\n\n\u201cGrant the stay of the Hawaii injunction, thereby allowing the government to proceed with its internal review of screening procedures, deny the stay of the Fourth Circuit injunction, and do whatever the heck they want about the petition for certiorari,\u201d Professor Tushnet wrote on Balkinization, a law blog. \u201cThe case will then almost certainly be moot by the time it\u2019s argued.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in the appeals courts?\n\nLast week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision by the judge in Maryland, refusing to revive the part of the ban limiting travel from the six countries. The vote was 10 to 3.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, heard arguments last month in the government\u2019s appeal from the Hawaii decision, but it has not yet issued a ruling.", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
