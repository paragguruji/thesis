And while other orders had blocked the deportation of travelers, Judge Birotte explicitly wrote that the government could not detain them or block their entry into the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ruling could affect hundreds of people who are in their home countries or stuck in airports in other countries, hoping that they would somehow be permitted to travel to the United States.\n\n\u201cEven after previous rulings, people have continued to have their visas and green cards canceled or coerced into signing them away,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, the deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \u201cThis should end that.\u201d\n\nWhile the A.C.L.U. has filed several complaints against the executive order, they are not involved in this case.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\n\n\u201cIf you take all these orders together, they are just an overwhelming repudiation of the executive order,\u201d Mr. Arulanantham, said. \u201cEvery court that has ruled on this has seen it as unconstitutional, so that is a strong sign that this is blatantly illegal. We very rarely get such uniform and swift action by the judicial branch for anything.\u201d\n\nIn the days since the executive order was issued, border officials and airline employees throughout the world have stopped people from the affected countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 from boarding planes headed for the United States. The Yemeni plaintiffs also said in court filings that American officials had confiscated their passports, repeating similar complaints from other travelers in the last several days.\n\nMr. Arulanantham said that while he believed the previous court orders had implied that United States officials should not prevent valid visa holders from getting on planes, Judge Birotte\u2019s order should force the government to stop that practice.\n\nBut even after a New York judge ruled that people with valid visas should not be sent back to their home countries, there were reports that it was continuing to happen. In many cases, travelers reported being held for 24 hours or more, far longer than a typical inspection to enter the country.\n\nIt remains unclear how the Trump administration will respond to the numerous judicial orders issued in the last several days.", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Jennifer Medina", "type": "article"}
