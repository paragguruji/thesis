Judge Watson agreed that the White House contradicted the Supreme Court\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nThe judge also said that a refugee\u2019s ties to a resettlement agency met the standard set by the Supreme Court for a bona fide relationship to an entity in the United States.\n\n\u201cAn assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency, in fact, meets each of the Supreme Court\u2019s touchstones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is formal, it is a documented contract, it is binding, it triggers responsibilities and obligations, including compensation, it is issued specific to an individual refugee only when that refugee has been approved for entry by the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nAbout 60 percent of all refugees admitted to the United States last year had family ties. That figure drops to about 25 percent for those from Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among the most common sources of refugees in recent years.\n\nPhoto\n\nMark Hetfield, president and chief executive of HIAS, a refugee and resettlement agency, called Judge Watson\u2019s ruling \u201ca sensible and humane interpretation of the plain words of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow grandparents and grandchildren who are refugees can be reunited with close family in the U.S., and U.S. communities can welcome those refugees for whom they have been waiting,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was unclear when or if the ruling would take effect, and the attorney general quickly vowed to challenge it before the Supreme Court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Supreme Court did not answer that question but agreed to hear arguments in the fall. In the meantime, it allowed a partial ban to proceed, affecting those without bona fide relationships in the United States, the ones least likely to win legal protection.\n\nUnder his executive order, Mr. Trump capped the number of refugee admissions in the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30 at 50,000, down from 110,000 allowed by President Barack Obama. But the Supreme Court said that refugees with bona fide relationships in the United States should be admitted even if the government reached the 50,000 cap, which it did this past week.", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"], "publish_date": "2017-07-14", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "reprieve", "travel", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "family", "win", "refugee", "court", "united", "states", "close", "resettlement", "federal", "refugees", "grandparents"], "summary": "\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cAn assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency, in fact, meets each of the Supreme Court\u2019s touchstones,\u201d he wrote.\nIt was unclear when or if the ruling would take effect, and the attorney general quickly vowed to challenge it before the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court did not answer that question but agreed to hear arguments in the fall.\nIn the meantime, it allowed a partial ban to proceed, affecting those without bona fide relationships in the United States, the ones least likely to win legal protection."}
