Just as they were about to leave, in late January, Mr. Trump\u2019s first pass at an immigration order put their plans on hold; when courts struck down the order, they were finally able to enter the country, on Feb. 9.\n\nHe heard about the president\u2019s action on Thursday night, while in the middle of a work sheet on English verb tenses. The jubilation he felt about an action by the president was, he said, \u201ca new emotion.\u201d\n\nMohamad Chaghlil, 35, a woodworker from Damascus, said he hoped the missile attack \u2014 far too limited in his view to change the course of the war \u2014 would be the start of a major course correction by Mr. Trump. But he said he doubted it.\n\nAnd like some other refugees, he questioned why a poison gas attack that was attributed to the government prompted the American strike now, when earlier atrocities did not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have full idea why he did that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lose hundreds of Syrian people every day, we lost more than half a million people in Syria. So why chemical attack is worse? Dead is dead. I can\u2019t understand, and the Syrians can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nMr. Chaghlil and his parents left Syria for Jordan four years ago, then began the laborious process of gaining refugee status. After his father died last July, his mother had to revise her paperwork, he said, delaying her case, so while Mr. Chaghlil came to the United States in December, she remains in Jordan.\n\n\u201cI talk with her every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is old. She needs me, and I need her. I\u2019m alone here and she is alone there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said he worries about where American immigration policy will leave her, and still sees the president as anti-Muslim.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said more than 150 members of his extended family have died in the violence in Syria.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a national hero now,\u201d he said of the president, adding, \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nMr. Asmi, 34, who arrived in Worcester, Mass., about 18 months ago, said he had stayed up all night after seeing news of the raid on Facebook, contacting elated friends and family around the world.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian people just gave up on anyone coming to their rescue,\u201d he said through an interpreter, Amjad Bahnassi, who is the chairman of the board that runs his mosque. The attack, Mr. Asmi said, was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nFor Zelekha Mahmoud, 31, news of the American missile attack allowed her to hope that the war could come to an end, and that she, her husband, and their four small children, could return home.\n\nThey settled in October in Chicago, and are adjusting to their new life. They pray and socialize at an Islamic center, the children go to school, and her husband has found work at a food packaging company. But she longs for Syria.\n\nThe Times is withholding her family name \u2014 Mahmoud is her middle name \u2014 because she fears for the safety of the children and four siblings still in Syria. She says she is grateful that the United States has sheltered her and her family, but she remains wary of the welcome here; Mr. Trump\u2019s travel orders at first made her fear they would be expelled.\n\nWhen her husband joyfully told her of the strike, \u201cI was so happy,\u201d she said, sitting in their apartment on Chicago\u2019s North Side.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI feel that maybe now they will get rid of Assad so that Syria will be secure again, so we can return,\u201d she said.\n\nMohamad Haidar, 47, who settled with his family in San Diego a year ago, said he feared that limited American strikes might escalate the war rather than tamp it down.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. wanted to interfere with military action it would be more beneficial to strike the presidential palace in Damascus,\u201d said Mr. Haidar, who, with his wife and three children, fled their town southwest of Aleppo in 2012, moving at first to Indonesia. \u201cThe United States is capable of stopping the conflict in one month if they are taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nUnlike some others, he said he was not angered by Mr. Trump\u2019s travel orders.\n\n\u201cI thought as the president, it is up to him to decide to decide what is beneficial to his own country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wish they took into consideration in the decision how many innocent people are suffering and hurting in Syria.\u201d", "authors": ["Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a", "Jess Bidgood"], "publish_date": "2017-04-07", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["syrian", "trump", "family", "laud", "strike", "united", "states", "syria", "trumps", "emotion", "children", "chaghlil", "refugees", "president", "mr", "attack"], "summary": "Mr. Mahmoud and his family left their hometown, northwest of Aleppo, and lived for years in Turkey, before getting permission to go to the United States.\nAnd like some other refugees, he questioned why a poison gas attack that was attributed to the government prompted the American strike now, when earlier atrocities did not.\n\u201cWe lose hundreds of Syrian people every day, we lost more than half a million people in Syria.\n\u201cMaybe he felt he has to do something for politics.\u201dAyham al-Asmi , who had been upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to bar refugees, was so enthusiastic in his support for the airstrikes that he said he would vote for Mr. Trump if he could.\n\u201cThe United States is capable of stopping the conflict in one month if they are taking it seriously.\u201dUnlike some others, he said he was not angered by Mr. Trump\u2019s travel orders."}
