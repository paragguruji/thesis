He added later, \u201cLuckily we now have a POTUS who does not waver or hesitate to do what is needed. And despite hysteria to the contrary, lawfully.\u201d\n\nThe conservative pundit Tomi Lahren, who supports Mr. Trump, wrote in an email that, \u201cIt\u2019s not intolerant or unloving to put Americans and American safety first. Every nation has the right to protect its people first.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow the left doesn\u2019t seem to understand or agree with that right,\u201d she said.\n\nThe response on the right was far from monolithic. The Koch brothers condemned the order as the \u201cwrong approach\u201d, and so did writers at their libertarian think-tank, the Cato Institute. John Podhoretz, the conservative commentator, reaffirmed that he thought Islamic terrorism posed a threat, but he wrote that the policy was not \u201cbased in fact.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Podhoretz wrote, the order resembled what he characterized as a liberal solution to major problems \u2014 a grand, gesture that the president was using to rally his base.\n\n\u201cThey are making horrible policy for naked political advantage based in disingenuousness,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s no way to run a country.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A spokesman for Mr. Trump at the time, Jason Miller, later clarified that the registry would not track individuals based on their religion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReuters reported that while protests filled airports where travelers were being held, many other people around the country were nonchalant about the order and puzzled by the protests.\n\nLouise Ingram, 69, of Troy, Ala., told Reuters that while she was not opposed to immigrants, \u201cI just want to make sure they are safe to come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cA country is not a country if it doesn\u2019t have borders,\u201d said Steve Hirsch, 63, who was at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where hundreds of people were protesting, to pick someone up this weekend.\n\nOn Mr. Trump\u2019s official Facebook page, his supporters thanked him for the action. One user, Jason Juno Lee, who identifies himself as a Marine, posted a comment comparing the United States after the order to a safely locked house.\n\n\u201cI lock my doors every night,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t lock them because I \u2018hate\u2019 the people outside. I lock them because I love the people inside!\u201d\n\nAnother user named Wes Schmaltz was more concise: \u201cThank you President Trump for doing exactly what you were elected to do.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Jonah Engel Bromwich", "type": "article"}
