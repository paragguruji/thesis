{"title": "Ryan Stands by Trump\u2019s Executive Order, Offering Only Gentle Criticism", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/paul-ryan-trump-executive-order.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama suggested that anyone surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s actions in government had not been paying attention.\n\n\u201cI think if you read what he ran on, you see what\u2019s coming,\u201d he said. Asked if he was concerned about how little the administration had coordinated with lawmakers, Mr. Shelby said, \u201cI\u2019m not, yet.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Democrats, seeking to delay the confirmation of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, were bracing on Tuesday for an even more consequential fight over the president\u2019s Supreme Court choice.\n\nSome have strained to conceal the psychic toll of opposing the president. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe this is Day 12 of the Trump presidency,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a member of the Democratic leadership.\n\nThe risks of countering Mr. Trump, and his Twittering fingers, were well known to Republicans, too, during the campaign. And no one seemed more willing to contend with them than Mr. Ryan.\n\nBut for some allies and longtime admirers of Mr. Ryan, the fallout from the refugee order has been difficult to stomach. They watched the speaker position himself last year as the party\u2019s conscience, consistently breaking with the nominee. Since the election, dissent has been muted and relations have improved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be just exquisitely painful for him,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative Wisconsin radio host and friend of Mr. Ryan\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s this ongoing calculation that you need to be allied in order to get your agenda put through. And yet the price tag keeps going up all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the concerns raised by some prominent Republicans, like Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Ryan\u2019s position appears to closely resemble that of most Republicans in the House, where Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order seems to enjoy considerable support.\n\nSeveral House Republicans, meeting before Mr. Ryan\u2019s remarks, defended the order and the president\u2019s behavior in recent days, playing down any turmoil that had resulted.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Yates as acting attorney general after she refused to defend his executive order drew praise. \u201cShe was a political hack,\u201d said Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas. \u201cI thought it was terrific.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Ra\u00fal Labrador, Republican of Idaho, said all administrations had \u201ca little bit of chaos\u201d in their first weeks.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re learning their lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to realize that it behooves both parties to actually have a little bit more communication.\u201d\n\nThe speaker initially weighed in on the order shortly after Mr. Trump signed it on Friday. \u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country,\u201d Mr. Ryan said then.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as several Republican lawmakers lodged complaints about the execution of the order \u2014 and, in rarer cases, the thrust of the order itself \u2014 Mr. Ryan largely removed himself from the fray. In a statement over the weekend, his office said the order was \u201cnot a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion,\u201d rejecting that there was any inconsistency between this position and Mr. Ryan\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration during the campaign.\n\nAt times on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan lurched toward testiness. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to debate, we\u2019re here to answer your questions,\u201d he told a reporter who interrupted one of his answers on the order.\n\nHe stressed that he supported the nation\u2019s refugee resettlement program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a generous country,\u201d he said, citing a \u201cvery good conversation\u201d with John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary. \u201cBut we can be generous and watch our national security at the same time.\u201d\n\nThose close to Mr. Ryan say his chief goals are shepherding legislative priorities like tax overhaul and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. He has grown accustomed to any broadsides that result from siding with Mr. Trump, they say, particularly from left-leaning sources.\n\n(These have not been in short supply lately: Gavin Newsom, the former Democratic mayor of San Francisco, wished Mr. Ryan a happy birthday on Twitter using a picture of the Cowardly Lion from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d And a Wikipedia user added Mr. Ryan\u2019s head shot to a list of invertebrates, beside horseshoe crabs and jellyfish.)\n\nMembers of what has often been an unruly Republican conference \u2014 particularly under Mr. Ryan\u2019s predecessor as speaker, John A. Boehner \u2014 have also cheered Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cHe knows that when you\u2019re talking about pieces of legislation that have to be signed by the president, it\u2019s helpful to have a good working relationship,\u201d said Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s office says he and the president speak daily, or close to it. He is known to call the president Donald.\n\nYet such access, it seems, does not always guarantee advance warning on policy. Mr. Ryan learned of the order, he said on Tuesday, \u201cpretty much at the time it was being issued.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Matt Flegenheimer", "type": "article"}
