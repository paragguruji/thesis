History since 2001 has taught us that our fear of immigrants is grossly, wildly exaggerated. Just as we have created laws to address nonexistent voter fraud, so too the justices now throw the president a lifeline concerning a travel ban grounded not in statistical confirmation but in bigotry, hatred and intolerance.\n\nThe justices want to apply a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d test to determine which travelers are permitted to travel here. Let those who have suffered the most egregious deprivations know that there are many who find their travails the most compelling, \u201cbona fide\u201d reason to open our hearts and our borders to them. Our relationship with them is bonded not in whom they may know here, but in our common humanity.\n\nShame on the Supreme Court.\n\nROBERT S. NUSSBAUM\n\nFORT LEE, N.J.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court to allow parts of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to proceed smacks of the favoritism that we saw just before the start of World War II.

Most of them never made it and perished in the gas chambers.\n\nIs this a precedent that we should really follow?\n\nPETER SAMTON, NEW YORK\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhy does the travel ban litigation continue? Isn\u2019t it moot? By its terms, the travel ban is a temporary, 90- to 120-day moratorium on certain travel. The professed purpose was to allow the government time to investigate and upgrade immigration procedures, on an emergency basis, while preventing malefactors from slipping into the country before this work was done.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout 150 days have passed since President Trump signed the first executive order, more time than the government said was needed to implement the necessary upgrades to immigration security. Assuming that the administration was reasonably diligent, shouldn\u2019t the changes have been made by now, rendering the ban unnecessary?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

KLINGON, NEW YORK\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court on immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries suggests that when interpreting the statute it is inappropriate to consider statements by President Trump on the campaign trail or in his tweets. But the issue is not whether discriminatory statements made in the heat of a presidential contest should determine the validity of a statute, but how those statements will affect the application of the law.", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | The Supreme Court Ruling on the Trump Travel Ban"}
