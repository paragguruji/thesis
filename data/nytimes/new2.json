On Friday afternoon, Trump signed an executive order suspending citizens of the aforementioned countries temporarily \u2014 except Syria, for which the travel ban is indefinite. The move set off chaos at airports around the country and world on Saturday as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began to enforce the order. A global uproar ensued, but Alidoosti was well ahead of the curve on the travel ban.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s visa ban for Iranians is racist,\u201d wrote Alidoosti in a post on Twitter a day before Trump enacted the travel ban. \u201cWhether this will include a cultural event or not, I won\u2019t attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.\u201d Now, it appears she wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the event event if she wanted to. The film\u2019s director, Asghar Farhadi, also would be barred from attending under the current executive order and on Sunday told The New York Times he wouldn\u2019t attend the event even if he\u2019s allowed to do so.\n\nTrump's visa ban for Iranians is racist.
