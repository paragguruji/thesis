But he shouldn\u2019t celebrate just yet: The decision is a loss, not a win, a distinction totally lost on our rapid-fire media.\n\nRead carefully, the opinion makes it clear that most of the Supreme Court justices think Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which restricts travel from six Muslim-majority countries, is likely to be struck down if the court hears the case in the fall, as scheduled.\n\nFor the past six months, Mr. Trump\u2019s ban has been on hold, battered repeatedly in a series of lawsuits. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ban likely violates the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on favoring or disfavoring certain religions (the Establishment Clause), while the Ninth Circuit held that the ban likely violates an immigration law that prohibits \u201cdiscriminating on the basis of nationality.\u201d Both courts ruled that the ban should be suspended in its entirety.\n\nMr. Trump is partly correct that the Supreme Court yesterday reached a different conclusion from those of the lower courts. Pending a full review in the fall, it left part of the ban in place, but only for people outside the United States who lack a relationship \u2014 family, educational or business ties \u2014 inside the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions are sometimes opaque, and in this opinion, there is more than meets the eye. The court made it clear that the Fourth and Ninth Circuits were correct to suspend the ban for those nationals who have \u201cbona fide\u201d relationships here in the country. That is a long list: families, university students and professors, business owners and partners. In drawing that line, the Supreme Court handed a major victory to the plaintiffs who brought these cases \u2014 people with families affected by the ban and the Hawaii attorney general, who sued, in part, on behalf of the state\u2019s university and its students.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Already, the court\u2019s logic suggests that it is strongly leaning toward striking down much of the ban when it hears oral argument this October. To enjoin an executive order \u2014 as the Fourth and Ninth Circuits did \u2014 a court must be convinced that the policy has a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d of being illegal. By keeping some of the injunctions against the travel ban in place pending the oral arguments scheduled for the fall, the Supreme Court was indicating that it agreed with the lower courts: The justices would not have kept the lower court\u2019s injunctions against the ban at all unless they agreed that the ban, at least in part, was likely to be found illegal.", "authors": ["Corey Brettschneider"], "publish_date": "2017-06-27", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["likely", "travel", "courts", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "court", "opinion", "fall", "sign", "safe", "mr", "isnt", "pending"], "summary": "PhotoYesterday President Trump tweeted that he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous opinion on his travel ban, which allowed some of it to stand pending the court\u2019s review this fall.\nFor the past six months, Mr. Trump\u2019s ban has been on hold, battered repeatedly in a series of lawsuits.\nMr. Trump is partly correct that the Supreme Court yesterday reached a different conclusion from those of the lower courts.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions are sometimes opaque, and in this opinion, there is more than meets the eye.\nAlready, the court\u2019s logic suggests that it is strongly leaning toward striking down much of the ban when it hears oral argument this October."}
