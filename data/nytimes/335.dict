Yet Mr. Tillerson used those three words together only once \u2014 when he requested that Saudi Arabia and Egypt do more to combat extremism.\n\nInstead, in front of a room full of diplomats, including many from Muslim countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s favored phrase is viewed as offensive, Mr. Tillerson emphasized a sympathetic view of Islam. He rejected characterizations by Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general and former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, that the religion is a \u201cmalignant cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also must look this enemy\u2019s ideology in the eyes for what it is: a warped interpretation of Islam that threatens all of our people,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said in yet another passage that could have come from the playbook. He cited King Abdullah II of Jordan, who recently said of the extremists, \u201cEverything they are, everything they do, is a blatant violation of my faith.\u201d\n\nJon Finer, chief of staff under former Secretary of State John Kerry, said Mr. Tillerson\u2019s speech felt very familiar.\n\n\u201cIt was good to hear both that progress continues to be made in this critical fight, and that, after months of baseless criticism, the new administration seems to have decided to stick with a strategy that is working,\u201d Mr. Finer said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf there were differences with the past administration, they were mostly in Mr. Tillerson\u2019s emphasis on fighting the Islamic State\u2019s online recruitment and propaganda, and in stabilizing Iraq and Syria once the militants are defeated. Over the last month, the Iraqi Army has pushed into western Mosul, the northern Iraqi city that has been a hard-fought battleground. And just this week, Syrian fighters aided by American military advisers have moved to isolate Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed capital in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to facilitate the return of people to their homes and work with local political leadership,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, adding, \u201cAs a coalition, we are not in the business of nation-building or reconstruction.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson urged the diplomats gathered at Foggy Bottom to do more. He said the United States had so far provided 75 percent of the military resources and 25 percent of the humanitarian support used against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe United States will do its part, but the circumstances on the ground require more from all of you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only clear difference between the Obama strategy and that of the Trump administration has been a loosening of restrictions on airstrikes. The potential downside of that change came the day before the conference opened, when at least 30 Syrian civilians were killed in an airstrike.\n\nRichard Atwood, New York director of the International Crisis Group, said in an interview that he was worried that growing civilian casualties, as well as the Trump administration\u2019s decision to become more bellicose with Iran, could backfire and weaken the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Tillerson was complimentary of the Iraqi government; Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq sat on stage while Mr. Tillerson spoke. It was a notable inclusion, given that Mr. Abadi was infuriated by Mr. Trump\u2019s first executive order, which banned travel from Iraq and six other Muslim-dominated countries. In an amended order, Mr. Trump dropped the travel restrictions against Iraq. Both orders have been suspended in court proceedings.\n\nMr. Abadi, in his own speech, seemed to promise that money spent on reconstructing Iraq would not be wasted, since he was also fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cCorruption and terrorism are a common plague,\u201d he said.", "publish_date": "2017-03-22", "authors": "Gardiner Harris", "type": "article"}
