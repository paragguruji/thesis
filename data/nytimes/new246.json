The future President Trump himself once tweeted: \u201cThe habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, is now in Hawaii. This vacation is costing taxpayers $4 million +++ while there is 20% unemployment.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate was not, at the time, anywhere near 20 percent. And last weekend Trump happily ran up a federal bill of around $3 million for a trip to Mar-a-Lago where he watched the Super Bowl and dropped in on a Red Cross ball, which presumably brought his resort a hefty fee.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s the profit-making end of the story that\u2019s so irritating. When Eric Trump went to Uruguay, his mission was to promote Trump Tower Punta del Este. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an amazing company,\u201d Eric told the local media, adding that his father was going to do \u201camazing things for the United States.\u201d And that Dad would be \u201can incredible commander in chief.\u201d The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, adjective-wise.\n\nThe president has theoretically separated himself from all his businesses, but they still belong to him. He may not have operational command, but Eric does, and it\u2019s hard for folks in Uruguay not to believe that the president is watching when the son comes to call and mix with his fellow realtors, flanked by a security detail that\u2019s on our dime.\n\nThose continuing financial interests around the world are a huge problem \u2014 you probably noticed that the immigration ban on Muslim-majority countries didn\u2019t include the ones in which the president had hotels or condos or golf courses? And he\u2019s never going to do anything to fix it. When Trump was calling for better ethics in Washington, he only wanted us to drain the other guys\u2019 swamp.\n\nBut don\u2019t you wish he\u2019d try to show he appreciates the security price tag? We don\u2019t want to make little Barron change schools, but Trump could buy Melania a condo in a relatively low-traffic location to save security from having to create a no-go zone in Midtown. It would send up a signal that he realized the problems he was causing. Also it would be cheaper for the Defense Department. And maybe closer to the school. The only thing inconvenienced would be Donald\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAnd Eric could have put his security detail up for free. Given that he was traveling on a moneymaking venture and all.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Meanwhile, you could argue that Trump is using a visit by an important foreign leader to promote one of his brands.\n\nAt least Abe has not been requested to pose holding up a gift bottle of Trump wine.
