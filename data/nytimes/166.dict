{"title": "After Visa Ban, Hints of Hidden Tension on Mississippi Campus", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/mississippi-state-trump-visa-ban.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cSome people say directly to you that it\u2019s a good order,\u201d he said, \u201cthat our country should have this order to ban terrorists.\u201d He finds their position especially hurtful, he said, in light of his fears of what the order might mean for him and his wife, and roughly 80 other students from the seven countries.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn estimated 17,000 students in the United States are touched by the ban, many of them in universities in the Northeast and California, where support for the president\u2019s move has been thin. But there are also sizable numbers in universities like Mississippi State, out-of-the-way pockets in states that voted for Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe move may be bringing to the surface hidden tensions between ambitious Middle Eastern students who have been welcomed to the United States with scholarships and job opportunities, and fellow students and other residents who believe the threat of terrorism necessitates a second look at who is let into the country.\n\nThe Mississippi State president, Mark E. Keenum, in a carefully worded statement that avoided the overt criticism of some counterparts at other universities, said that the university would try to help the students affected by the order and that its \u201ccore values of diversity, inclusion, tolerance and safety for all \u2014 regardless their country of origin \u2014 do not waver or change.\u201d\n\nThat was a different message from that of the governor, Phil Bryant, who has said there were \u201ca lot of people overreacting\u201d to what he believed was a reasonable pause in immigration from the seven countries.\n\nMany students and alumni, on Facebook and in public, have expressed support for Mr. Trump\u2019s move. Zach Cooke, 21, an electrical engineering major from Amory, Miss., said that while the ban\u2019s execution was poor, \u201cWith what\u2019s going on at the moment, I think a limit on who can come into the country is not a bad idea.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, a vocal segment of the school and town \u2014 county voters went narrowly for Hillary Clinton in a state that was heavily pro-Trump \u2014 has expressed support for the affected students. At a vigil Wednesday night, about 250 people gathered on an open green near the football stadium, carrying candles and holding signs. \u201cImmigrants make America great,\u201d read one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne organizer, a veterinary medicine student named Anna Walker, said she was inspired by a photograph of a protest at Washington Square Park in New York. \u201cI realized that we needed a show of support in smaller communities,\u201d Ms. Walker, 26, said.\n\nOnce known solely for its agriculture program \u2014 even today fans ring cowbells at football games, and prized herds of cows graze on campus pastures \u2014 Mississippi State has worked in recent years to excel in technology and engineering, recruited scientists from all over the world to its 21,000-student campus and attracted hundreds of millions in dollars in research money, much of it from the federal government.\n\nThe foreigners who live and work here include many Muslims; an unprepossessing mosque operates in a converted house on a residential street, and there are regular gatherings for holidays like Nowruz, the Persian New Year.\n\nThe executive order, signed Friday, barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It halted admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and that of other refugees for 120 days. Though students from those countries can stay, for now, they fear that they cannot leave the United States because they would not be allowed back in, and they wonder how any new vetting procedures being considered by the Trump administration might affect their future studies and travel.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMost people are distracted from school,\u201d said Erfan Alkamil, 25, a senior who received a scholarship from the Yemeni government. \u201cSome have been watching the news all day long. They are waiting to read something that might change the situation, or at least make them comfortable.\u201d\n\nMr. Alkamil, like other Middle Eastern students, said they have generally found Mississippi State to be welcoming, even accommodating. His American friends assumed \u2014 correctly \u2014 that as a Muslim, he did not drink alcohol and now offer him juice instead of wine without even asking.\n\nAdjustments are needed, though; there is no halal food market, so Mr. Alkamil has learned to like Subway sandwiches, and group meals are often held in private homes. Several of the students said the hardest acclimation was to Southern accents.\n\nNegative interactions are rare, students said, but they happen. Kimia Mortezaei, 29, who just finished her Ph.D. in civil engineering, recalled how at the farmer\u2019s market one day, an older woman stopped her to compliment her on her \u201cbeautiful\u201d dress and asked where she was from. She replied that she was from Iran, and the woman asked what she planned to do after she finished her studies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said I prefer to stay here,\u201d Ms. Mortezaei recalled. \u201cShe suddenly told me aggressively, \u2018You have to return to your country because you endanger our safety, because you\u2019re a Muslim and you\u2019re a terrorist like ISIS.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat this stranger could not know, she added, was that she had left Iran precisely because she disagreed with Iranian politics. \u201cI left Iran because of those problems, and now we are labeled a terrorist,\u201d Ms. Mortezaei said.\n\nFear of terrorism is indeed a theme in comments and Facebook posts from students, local residents and alumni who support the ban. Numerous people have brought up the case of two recent Mississippi State students \u2014 one a convert to Islam, the other a longtime resident in town whose father was a well-known Muslim community leader \u2014 who were arrested in 2015 and later sent to prison for plotting to join ISIS.\n\nEven with his finely threaded statement, Mr. Keenum, the university\u2019s president, has been criticized. This 1983 graduate\u2019s Facebook response was typical: \"President Keenum needs to stand up for the nation\u2019s security.\u201d (Mr. Keenum, through a spokesman, declined an interview request.)\n\nOutwardly, the campus remains a picture of idyllic detachment from the nation\u2019s larger tumult. On Wednesday the Baptist Student Union held its weekly $3 lunch and prayer meeting. With dogwood and Japanese magnolia trees already in full bloom, many students were wearing shorts.\n\nAn exception was one woman who made her way across campus dressed in a niqab \u2014 a head covering with only her eyes showing. The woman, who would not give her name but said she was from Saudi Arabia, a country not covered by the ban, said she was very anxious about her future in the United States and called the president\u2019s move \u201cagainst humanity.\u201d\n\nAshkan Khalili, 33, an Iranian about to graduate from his aerospace engineering doctoral program, is also beginning to fret. He will soon graduate from his doctoral program and his permit will expire. But he said he was hoping to stay and work in the United States, and repay the country for its hospitality. \u201cNow the question is, do they want me to pay it back, or go back?\u201d he asked.\n\nVahid Daghigh, 32, a Ph.D. engineering student from Iran, said he suddenly found himself feeling jealous of international students not from the seven countries.\n\n\u201cFor sure, I will try to stay here,\u201d Mr. Daghigh said. \u201cBut if not, I will go to Canada.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Stephanie Saul and Anemona Hartocollis", "type": "article"}
