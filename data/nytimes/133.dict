In a terse statement, Adelson said he had been excluded from talks before the team sent a lease proposal last week to the public board that would own the 65,000-seat stadium.\n\nAdelson said his family and the Las Vegas Sands Corporation would \u201cno longer be involved in any facet\u201d of the plan. In a statement, the Raiders still vowed to make the move happen.\n\nAdelson had pledged $650 million to bolster the Raiders\u2019 $500 million commitment, with the stadium authority agreeing to contribute $750 million in Las Vegas tax revenue. The office of Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada said the Raiders would now have to invest $1.15 billion and accept operating responsibilities.\n\nN.F.L. owners are expected to vote in March on the Raiders\u2019 request to move.\n\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\nTennessee Beats Third Top-10 Team\n\nThe junior Jamie Nared had a career-high 27 points, including two free throws with 5.9 seconds that broke a tie, as the Tennessee women\u2019s team ended No. 4 South Carolina\u2019s 29-game home winning streak in the Southeastern Conference with a 76-74 victory.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
