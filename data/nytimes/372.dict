He has not used Twitter as a cudgel against adversaries since his overseas trip began.\n\nIn his speech on Sunday, he made no mention of the executive orders he signed after taking office barring visitors from several predominantly Muslim countries. Instead, he described Islam as \u201cone of the world\u2019s great faiths\u201d and called for \u201ctolerance and respect for each other.\u201d\n\nWhile in the past Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama and others for not using the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d his staff sought to ensure that he would not use it before this Muslim audience. The final draft of the speech had him instead embracing a subtle but significant switch, using the term \u201cIslamist extremism.\u201d Islamist is often defined to mean someone who advocates Islamic fundamentalism, and some experts prefer its use to avoid tarring the entire religion.\n\nWhen that moment in the speech came, however, Mr. Trump went off script and used both words, Islamic and Islamist. \u201cThat means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds,\u201d he said. An aide said afterward that the president was \u201cjust an exhausted guy\u201d and had tripped over the term, rather than rejected the language suggested by his aides.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if the speech during the second day of a nine-day overseas trip was intended as a sort of reset from his campaign and early presidency, it was also meant to turn away from Mr. Obama\u2019s approach. Rather than preach about human rights or democracy, Mr. Trump said he wanted \u201cpartners, not perfection.\u201d And he said it was up to Muslim leaders to expunge extremists from their midst.\n\n\u201cDrive them out,\u201d he said. \u201cDrive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump received a warm welcome in the room as Muslim leaders put behind them the messages of the campaign and the attempted travel ban, and he has gotten along well with fellow leaders, who have turned to flattery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou are a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible,\u201d President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt told him.\n\n\u201cI agree!\u201d Mr. Trump responded cheerily, as laughter rolled through the room.\n\nA few moments later, Mr. Trump returned the compliment, in a fashion. \u201cLove your shoes,\u201d he told Mr. Sisi. \u201cBoy, those shoes. Man!\u201d\n\nBut some activists back in the United States gave the president mixed reviews at the start of his trip.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To firm up such a coalition, he spent hours meeting individually with leaders from Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, then with more Muslim leaders in larger groups.\n\n\u201cThis administration is committed to a 180-degree reversal of the Obama policy on Iran,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. \u201cThey see the Iranian threat as fundamentally linked to the nature and behavior of the regime and its revolutionary and expansionist ideology.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump toured the new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, which employs 350 technicians tracking online radicalism and monitoring 100 television channels in 11 languages. The Trump administration and Saudi Arabia also announced the creation of a joint Terrorist Financing Targeting Center to formalize longstanding cooperation and search for new ways to cut off sources of money for extremists.\n\nMr. Trump made little mention of human rights in any of the meetings, and he promised in his speech not to do so publicly. \u201cWe are not here to lecture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership \u2014 based on shared interests and values \u2014 to pursue a better future for us all.\u201d\n\nThat approach drew bipartisan criticism back in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s in our national security interest to advocate for democracy and freedom and human rights,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d On the same program, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called it \u201ca terrible abdication of our global leadership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichele Dunne, the director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the president had laid blame for terrorism on Muslim leaders who he says have not done enough. \u201cThere are elements of truth to Trump\u2019s narrative,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it ignores the deeper grievances, the political and economic injustices, that make young people in the region especially susceptible to extremist ideologies at this particular time.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the change in the president\u2019s tone about the relationship between Islam and terrorism was striking. As he assailed Mr. Obama last year for not using the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Mr. Trump asserted that \u201canyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country.\u201d He used the phrase again in his inaugural address in January.\n\nEven after Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, told his staff that the phrase was problematic and should not be used, the president defiantly repeated it days later in an address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nStill, General McMaster said in an interview broadcast on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that Mr. Trump had been listening to the Muslim leaders he has met since becoming president and understood their views better. \u201cThis is learning,\u201d General McMaster said.\n\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters, \u201cThe president clearly was extending a hand, and understanding that only together can we address this threat of terrorism.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is still appealing court rulings that blocked his temporary travel ban, the president has not publicly raised the issue as much lately, and the page on his campaign site calling for the \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslim immigration has been taken down.\n\nSome advisers who advocated stronger action and language about what they call the Islamic threat have either left the administration or faded in influence. Michael T. Flynn, General McMaster\u2019s predecessor as national security adviser, was fired for other reasons. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, has lost sway. And Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to the president, has been reported to possibly be leaving the White House at some point.\n\nEven so, the hard-liners found enough to be happy with in the speech. After the president was finished on Sunday, Mr. Gorka wrote on Twitter: \u201cAfter 8yrs disastrous terror-enabling policies we now have @POTUS: \u2018We r going 2 defeat terrorism & send its wicked ideology in2 OBLIVION.\u2019\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-21", "authors": "Peter Baker and Michael D.
