Before the game started, Coca-Cola re-aired an ad from 2014 called \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d which depicts Americans of different races and religions singing the song in a variety of languages. The building supply company 84 Lumber had to change an ad that showed a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter in front of a border wall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a memo to employees after the executive order, Airbnb\u2019s chief executive, Brian Chesky, was more explicit about his opposition. \u201cThis is a policy I profoundly disagree with, and it is a direct obstacle to our mission at Airbnb,\u201d Mr. Chesky wrote on Jan. 29. That weekend, the company began to provide free and subsidized temporary housing for people who had been affected by the immigration restrictions.\n\nTwo Airbnb officials who were not permitted to speak on the record said the company had not planned to advertise during the Super Bowl until executives heard there was still ad space left.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It aired right before the second quarter.\n\nAirbnb was using the Super Bowl to highlight its commitment to provide short-term housing for 100,000 people in need over the next five years, including for refugees, victims of natural disasters and aid workers. The company has also committed to donate $4 million over the next four years to the International Rescue Committee, a group that helps displaced people around the world.\n\n\u201cAirbnb has been supporting refugees well before the current controversies,\u201d said David Miliband, the organization\u2019s president and chief executive.\n\nIn 2015, Airbnb provided travel credits to relief workers at Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee and gave matching donations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2016, the company was a partner in the White House\u2019s Call to Action to respond to the global refugee crisis.\n\n\u201cAirbnb\u2019s mission to bring strangers together who help each other in various ways is core to our mission as well,\u201d Mr. Miliband said. \u201cSo many Americans were refugees. It\u2019s core to the identity and success of the country.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": "Katie Benner", "type": "article"}
