Instead, they are renaming it \u201ccountering Islamic extremism,\u201d or \u201ccountering radical Islamic extremism.\u201d\n\nFine. Abandon the name, but let\u2019s not abandon the strategy. First, let\u2019s acknowledge that it\u2019s working. The Islamic State as a military force, much less as a caliphate, is on the ropes in Iraq and Syria. The group has not had a military victory in a year and a half. The flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria is down by 90 percent, according to the Defense Department. The liberation of Mosul is on the horizon.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I led the State Department\u2019s agency that sought to counter the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda efforts and saw this firsthand. More than 80 percent of the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda is in Arabic. Russian is the second-most-used language, while English and French are tied for third. The United States is not the Islamic State\u2019s main audience. We have always been the distant enemy.\n\nSo, jettison \u201cviolent extremism,\u201d but let our Arab allies know that \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d refers only to the tiny fraction of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims who have embraced violence. Tell them we need their help both on the military battlefield and in the information and intelligence space. And be specific: \u201cWe are fighting the Islamic State and Al Qaeda and their radical Islamic imitators like Boko Haram.\u201d After all, \u201cradical Islam\u201d is only a shade less vague than \u201cviolent extremism.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State is not just a terrorist group, it is an idea. Its rallying cry is that the West is hostile to Islam and that every good Muslim has a duty to join the caliphate. Most of the group\u2019s propaganda was not violent at all. I saw thousands of tweets about how beautiful the caliphate was. There were videos of kids on Ferris wheels and jihadi fighters distributing cotton candy. I remember one tweet showing a shiny apple and the words, in Arabic, \u201cThe caliphate is bountiful.\u201d\n\nIt is not up to us to say what is Islamic and what is not. Only the voices of mainstream Muslims and independent clerics in Muslim countries can create a narrative that refutes the Islamic State\u2019s and offers a more positive alternative. A tweet from the United States government saying the Islamic State is a distortion of Islam is not going to hurt the group. Instead, it will help its recruiting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is why the Trump administration\u2019s executive order on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations is deeply counterproductive in the fight against Islamic extremism. It has already been reported that the Islamic State has called it \u201cthe blessed ban\u201d because it supports the Islamic State\u2019s position that America hates Islam. The clause in the order that gives Christians preferential treatment will be seen as confirming the Islamic State\u2019s apocalyptic narrative that Islam is in a fight to the death against the Christian crusaders. The images of Muslim visitors being turned away at American airports will only inflame those who seek to do us harm.\n\nTwo years ago, just before Ramadan, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, said: Don\u2019t bother coming to the caliphate, but commit acts of violence against the enemy wherever you are. The call was no longer religious or ideological \u2014 what the group sought to do was exploit vulnerability. Mr. Adnani was, in effect, saying, \u201cWhatever angers you \u2014 whether it\u2019s your boss or your neighbors or the police \u2014 commit acts of violence in the Islamic State\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nThus, the black flag of the Islamic State became a flag of convenience for any complaint. Now the travel ban, despite being blocked by the courts, has given the group ammunition to weaponize grievance here in America. President Trump may become its No. 1 recruiting tool.\n\nThe Islamic State will go away, but violent extremism will not. The way to defeat radical Islamic extremism is to help our Islamic allies and promote the voices of mainstream Islam that reject everything the Islamic State does and stands for. Defeating the Islamic State on the military battlefield is only temporary. Violent extremism \u2014 or whatever you call it \u2014 must be defeated on the battlefield of ideas.", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "authors": "Richard Stengel", "type": "article"}
