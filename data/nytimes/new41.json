She was about 8 years old. The shrapnel hit her leg, leaving her with scars. It took years before she could sleep without holding somebody\u2019s hand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSee, be thankful we brought you up here,\u201d she said to her children on a recent afternoon, as she served them a Lebanese wheat dish called freekeh at their dining room table.\n\nThe Elcharfas\u2019 home is dotted with references to Arab and Muslim culture. Their couches are gold-trimmed. A kitchen clock marks the Islamic call to prayer. Their children speak fluent Arabic and have taken Quran classes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The four youngest children all attend public school. Abubeckr, 13, loves video games and dreams of playing in the N.B.A. Maaria puts on makeup in her pink-walled bedroom, and Zaynub, a gymnast, does flips in the kitchen, wearing a pink shirt that says, \u201cLeave sparkles wherever you go.\u201d\n\nMr. Elcharfa often tells his children they are American first, before they are Lebanese.\n\n\u201cWe tell them this is your country,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re born here.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes, in school, classmates only see the children\u2019s Muslim names and Arab heritage. In the hallways in Abubeckr\u2019s school, boys will sometimes make sounds of bombs exploding and yell out \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 Arabic for \u201cGod is great\u201d \u2014 as he walks by. On the bus after school, a classmate once said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist, and your mom is a mastermind bomber.\u201d\n\nHe told the principal the next day, but he did not tell his parents. He is used to the jeering at this point, Abubeckr said, and does not want his mother to \u201cmake it a bigger deal than it is.\u201d His father has taught him to tell an adult, but not to react physically or verbally. \u201cIf you ignore it, it\u2019s better,\u201d Abubeckr said.\n\nBut Mr. Elcharfa sees the taunts taking a toll on his children. They frequently ask him not to speak in Arabic in front of their friends. After the explosion in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan last month, his 15-year-old, Ismail, told him, \u201cThat\u2019s your Islam, Baba.\u201d\n\nAbubeckr, who was in Italian class when he heard the news, thought to himself, It was a Muslim, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cI was like, here we go again,\u201d he said, recounting that day while sitting with his father in the family\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cWhy do you say a Muslim; why don\u2019t you say a person?\u201d Mr. Elcharfa asked his son.\n\nThese are the moments that worry Mr. Elcharfa and his wife. They fret that their children are starting to distance themselves from their religion and their culture. These are also the moments when the couple\u2019s parenting styles clash.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Elcharfa wants his children to be freethinkers. He does not want them to be practicing Muslims simply because they inherited the religion from their parents. Sometimes, he said, he wishes their religion could be hidden from view. He said he felt pangs of regret for giving them Muslim names: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I name them Tony or George?\u201d\n\nHis wife scoffs at such comments.", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt"], "publish_date": "2016-10-26", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["main", "trump", "tell", "scary", "face", "election", "elcharfa", "donald", "youre", "religion", "parents", "school", "reading", "children", "muslim", "mr", "dream", "tense"], "summary": "Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re born here.\u201dBut sometimes, in school, classmates only see the children\u2019s Muslim names and Arab heritage.\nBut Mr. Elcharfa sees the taunts taking a toll on his children.\n\u201cWhy do you say a Muslim; why don\u2019t you say a person?\u201d Mr. Elcharfa asked his son.\nThese are the moments that worry Mr. Elcharfa and his wife."}
