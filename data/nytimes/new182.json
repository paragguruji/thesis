Hetherington, a Vanderbilt University political scientist and an author, along with Mr. Weiler, of the book \u201cAuthoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics.\u201d And many others who would ordinarily be more tolerant and open will turn against outsiders if they feel especially frightened \u2014 in times of war, for instance, or after a terrorist attack.\n\nThat fear creates a ripe environment for politics that targets a particular minority with repressive policies in the name of \u201cprotecting\u201d the majority.\n\nPoliticians who work from the \u201cplaybook\u201d of how to take advantage of those innate human biases, Mr. Hetherington said, can use that fear to bolster their popularity and political power.\n\nIt is a playbook that authoritarian leaders around the world have followed. They may do so out of a conscious desire to manipulate the public, a belief that the group they target poses a threat, or some combination of both.\n\nOften, leaders argue that the targeted group is so dangerous that ordinary checks and balances must be set aside and core norms abandoned to properly respond to the threat.\n\nMr. Weiler cited the example of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who was elected on a promise to rid the country of drug dealers, as an example of an elected leader who used such tactics. Since taking office, Mr. Duterte has encouraged the police to kill thousands of civilians accused of being drug \u201cpushers.\u201d\n\nEelco van der Maat, an expert in authoritarian consolidation at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said leaders tend to be strategic about the groups they identify as threats. They focus on those who are politically marginalized and relatively powerless, and who are already seen as alien and frightening. Targeting such groups, Mr. van der Maat said, is \u201ceasier\u201d because the public is more likely to accept that those groups are threatening, and that there also is little political cost to persecuting those who are already weak.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

And the public\u2019s fear of terrorism makes Muslim immigrants a particularly easy target, he added. \u201cMix in the 9/11 attacks, and you can turn this into concerns about survival.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. van der Maat said the us-them boundary tends to not remain stable, however. Authoritarian leaders, he has found in his research, tend to expand the category of people targeted as threatening outsiders.\n\nAnd their policies often become harsher as well as broader, Mr. van der Maat said, as leaders climb what he called \u201cthe ladder of violence\u201d \u2014 moving from discrimination into more significant persecution.\n\nLarge-scale deportations, such as those Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail, would be a step higher on that ladder, Mr. Van der Maat said, because they would require the use of force and affect a wide segment of the population. The president last week signed an executive order that would give law enforcement officials expanded resources for carrying out deportations, and promised to punish \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts.\n\nTesting the limits of power\n\nMr. Trump is a democratically elected president, and the United States is a democracy. But the experts caution that does not mean that the lessons of authoritarian behavior should be ignored entirely.\n\nPresidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Weiler said, were democratically elected, then systematically undermined democratic checks and balances to consolidate their own power.\n\nLeaders with authoritarian tendencies \u201cwill push and push until they find a spot where they can\u2019t push anymore \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll keep going,\u201d Ms. Berman said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching that process happen in not-so-slow motion in Turkey now,\u201d she said, where Mr. Erdogan has \u201ceroded the democratic system to the point where most analysts think it\u2019s no longer democratic at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban, if it is found to be legal, is not necessarily a step toward that kind of democratic decline, Ms. Berman said. The key thing to watch for, she said, is whether he will try to use the power of the presidency to push through illegal rules or overrule checks and balances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat has not yet occurred. But the ban is a sign that Mr. Trump is willing to push the limits of the norms of American governing. By circumventing normal procedures for drafting and issuing executive orders, the White House created confusion and chaos within the agencies that will enforce the new rules. On Monday, Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said she did not think the ban was legal and directed the Justice Department not to defend it. Mr. Trump fired her later that day.\n\nSeveral federal courts have issued emergency orders that limit the new rules\u2019 effect. There have been reports of Customs and Border Protection officials refusing to comply with the court orders, prompting concerns that this could lead to a direct clash between the judicial and executive branches. If the executive branch blocks the judicial branch from enforcing its orders, that could perhaps lead to the type of constitutional crisis Ms. Berman warned of.\n\nThe United States today is in a far different position than Turkey under Mr. Erdogan. But, Ms. Berman said, Turkey had one advantage: multiple opposition parties that could obstruct Mr. Erdogan\u2019s agenda. By contrast, in the American political system, \u201copposition has to come from within the main party itself\u201d \u2014 particularly when that party controls both houses of Congress and the presidency, as the Republican Party does.\n\nBut as long as Mr. Trump remains popular with a core base of supporters who appreciate this type of us-versus-them politics, Mr. Hetherington said, resisting him will be politically risky for Republicans.\n\nAnd if Republican lawmakers allow Mr. Trump to continue with his promised crackdowns, they will have an opportunity to make progress on their legislative agenda, including tax cuts and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat leaves experts uncertain about how far Mr. Trump might push against the core norms of America\u2019s liberal democracy. \u201cWe are now all looking for things that could be some kind of slippery slope,\u201d Ms. Berman said.", "authors": ["Amanda Taub", "The Interpreter"], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "van", "travel", "trump", "ban", "ladder", "push", "violence", "ms", "maat", "leaders", "berman", "mr", "der", "authoritarian"], "summary": "And their policies often become harsher as well as broader, Mr. van der Maat said, as leaders climb what he called \u201cthe ladder of violence\u201d \u2014 moving from discrimination into more significant persecution.\nLeaders with authoritarian tendencies \u201cwill push and push until they find a spot where they can\u2019t push anymore \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll keep going,\u201d Ms. Berman said.\nBut the ban is a sign that Mr. Trump is willing to push the limits of the norms of American governing.\nThat leaves experts uncertain about how far Mr. Trump might push against the core norms of America\u2019s liberal democracy.\n\u201cWe are now all looking for things that could be some kind of slippery slope,\u201d Ms. Berman said."}
