Instead of being allowed to accompany them, Mr. Darweesh found himself detained overnight \u2014 at times handcuffed \u2014 and unsure if he would be returned to Iraq, the country he had fled in fear for his life.\n\n\u201cWe have a moral obligation to protect and repay these people who risked their lives for U.S. troops,\u201d said Brandon Friedman, who, as an infantry lieutenant with the 101st Airborne Division, worked with Mr. Darweesh in Iraq. Mr. Friedman later served in the Obama administration at both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\u201cThere are not many Americans who have done as much for this country as he has,\u201d Mr. Friedman added. \u201cHe\u2019s put himself on the line.

Thanks to a handful of immigration lawyers who spent the darkest hours of Saturday morning writing motions and wheedling information from immigration officials, Mr. Darweesh was released in the early afternoon after spending nearly 19 hours in detention. The intercession of two Democratic representatives from New York \u2014 Jerrold Nadler and Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez \u2014 surely helped clear the way.", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Nicholas Kulish", "type": "article"}
