This does not include tourists or students trying to enter the country.\n\nThe order came in response to a complaint filed on behalf of 28 people from Yemen \u2014 United States citizens and their family members who had remained in Yemen but later received immigrant visas. The visa holders have been stuck in an airport in Djibouti since President Trump issued his executive order on Friday, according to the complaint.\n\nLike in other rulings in New York and Boston, Judge Birotte wrote that the plaintiffs would likely succeed in court on the merits and that they would also \u201clikely suffer irreparable harm\u201d without an injunction. Yemen is currently embroiled in a civil war with civilians in danger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut unlike some other cases, Judge Birotte\u2019s ruling seemed to apply throughout the country, not just to Los Angeles International Airport. And while other orders had blocked the deportation of travelers, Judge Birotte explicitly wrote that the government could not detain them or block their entry into the country.", "authors": ["Jennifer Medina"], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["immigrant", "birotte", "wrote", "trump", "yemen", "orders", "visas", "holders", "judge", "court", "united", "states", "order", "let", "visa"], "summary": "The judge\u2019s order affects only people who are seeking to live in the United States permanently and are taking the first steps to becoming a legal resident.\nThe order came in response to a complaint filed on behalf of 28 people from Yemen \u2014 United States citizens and their family members who had remained in Yemen but later received immigrant visas.\nThe visa holders have been stuck in an airport in Djibouti since President Trump issued his executive order on Friday, according to the complaint.\nLike in other rulings in New York and Boston, Judge Birotte wrote that the plaintiffs would likely succeed in court on the merits and that they would also \u201clikely suffer irreparable harm\u201d without an injunction.\nAnd while other orders had blocked the deportation of travelers, Judge Birotte explicitly wrote that the government could not detain them or block their entry into the country."}
