Over all he took a hard line on immigration, much as he had during the campaign.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\u201d\n\nBut in contrast with the dark themes of his inaugural address, Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to Congress was a more optimistic vision of America and what he called the promises ahead. The themes were largely Republican orthodoxy, delivered soberly and almost verbatim from a prepared text. Mr. Trump read from Teleprompters and appeared restrained and serious.\n\nRepublicans interrupted dozens of times with standing ovations, although Democrats mostly sat stone-faced. Mr. Trump presented himself as eager to put aside some of the vitriol of his presidency.\n\n\u201cThe time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.\u201d\n\nThe most emotional moment of the speech came when Mr. Trump recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of William Ryan Owens, a member of a Navy SEAL team who was killed during a commando raid that the president authorized in Yemen. Ms. Owens sobbed as Mr. Trump said, \u201cRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had guaranteed him that it was a \u201chighly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence.\u201d Mr. Trump has been criticized for the raid, including by Mr. Owens\u2019s father, with some arguing the operation was botched. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had blamed Mr. Owens\u2019s death on \u201cthe generals\u201d who oversaw the mission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has been defined by executive orders and pronouncements, his speech appeared to be an attempt to open a new phase and reflected his need for cooperation from Congress.\n\n\u201cMy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president has yet to propose major legislation to achieve his goals, with members of his cabinet and senior staff members divided over key elements of tax and health plans, and congressional Republicans split on how to structure them. By this point in his presidency, Mr. Obama had established an active \u2014 if not always friendly \u2014 working relationship with a Democratic Congress, having signed into law a $787 billion package of spending and tax cuts intended to stabilize the economy.\n\nMr. Trump laid out the broad outlines of a health care overhaul that papered over divisions among Republicans about how to structure it, calling for a plan that uses tax credits and tax-advantaged savings accounts to help Americans buy insurance, and promising a \u201cstable transition\u201d from the existing system.\n\nYet he made no mention of an array of challenges abroad, including Syria, North Korea and Russia. Nor did Mr. Trump criticize one of his favorite foils, the \u201cfake news\u201d media. He did pledge his full support for NATO after questioning the need for the alliance, and argued that his demands that nations contribute more money to NATO had paid off.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the money is pouring in,\u201d Mr. Trump said without providing examples or specifics. \u201cVery nice.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Such a move would be a significant turnaround for Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies rang with shouts of \u201cbuild the wall!\u201d on the Mexican border. In January, he signed an executive order directing the deportation of any unauthorized immigrant who has committed a crime or falsified a document. The standard could apply to virtually any of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.\n\nIn his comments to the television anchors at the White House, Mr. Trump went so far as to raise the idea of granting citizenship to young undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children, one person present said. Such a change would go well beyond the temporary work permits President Barack Obama offered them through a 2012 executive order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s directive as an \u201cillegal amnesty,\u201d and promised to immediately end the program if elected. But he has delayed acting on the matter since taking office and expressed sympathy for its beneficiaries, sometimes known as Dreamers.\n\nThe White House did not dispute Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks to the anchors, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said she had not witnessed the conversation and was therefore unable to confirm it.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe president has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he\u2019s made clear that he\u2019s open to having conversations about that moving forward,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cRight now, his primary focus, as he has made over and over again, is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities have not changed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks about immigration came as he prepares to issue a new version of his executive order banning travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the acceptance of refugees. The ban has been revised because of legal challenges.\n\nMr. Trump defended that order in his address to Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThose given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America \u2014 we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\u201d\n\nThe speech reflected the war Mr. Trump is fighting with himself and his inner circle. Even as he held out the possibility of legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants, Melania Trump, the first lady, was hosting the families of victims of violent crime by such immigrants \u2014 a way of highlighting the president\u2019s belief that immigrants who lack legal status pose a grave threat to Americans and should be feared and removed, not embraced.\n\nMr. Trump singled out the victims\u2019 families, saying, \u201cYour loved ones will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nGiving the official Democratic response, former Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky offered an implicit contrast to the president by noting his own humble background and military service, accusing Mr. Trump and his \u201ccabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders\u201d of favoring banks and the wealthy over ordinary people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health care away from millions of people who most need it,\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. It\u2019s life and death for people.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the president turned to the top advisers who helped develop his inaugural address: Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist. The two were still working on the speech late Monday, aides said.\n\nMr. Miller and Mr. Bannon, both architects of the president\u2019s tough immigration policies, were responsible for shaping the dark themes of the president\u2019s speech on Inauguration Day.", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Michael D.
