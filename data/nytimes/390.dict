Wall, a respected Washington lawyer now serving as acting solicitor general. In the administration\u2019s Supreme Court petition, filed last Thursday before the latest Twitter storm, he wrote that \u201cthe few post-inauguration remarks by the president and aides do not demonstrate an impermissible purpose.\u201d\n\nAnd referring in the petition to Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail, Mr. Wall wrote that courts should regard as irrelevant what a candidate says before actually becoming president: \u201cTaking that oath marks a profound transition from private life to the nation\u2019s highest public office and manifests the singular responsibility and independent authority to protect the welfare of the nation that the Constitution reposes in the president.\u201d It\u2019s the very absence of any such \u201cprofound transition\u201d in President Trump\u2019s behavior that increasingly concerns his critics and even some close allies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Whatever happens with the travel ban, I think the president\u2019s near-constant expression of disdain for courts and for what they represent is already having an effect on the federal judiciary \u2013 and not the one he presumably intends.\n\nUnlike a president and those who act in his name, federal judges have life tenure. Unlike a mogul in an industry that thrives on showmanship, on calling a competitor\u2019s bluff before he calls yours, and on putting up buildings taller and gaudier than those of one\u2019s rivals, judges inhabit a world of nuance and constraint where every word carries weight and wiping the slate clean of the past is almost never an option. Where those outside the courts \u2013 both those who criticize and those who seek the courts\u2019 help \u2013 see power, judges inside the system sense fragility. They are alarmed. Increasingly, they are speaking out.\n\nLast week, Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an anguished opinion in an immigration case, noting that his court had no legal power to stop a deportation that he considered deeply unjust. The Mexican-born immigrant, Andres Magana Ortiz, came to the United States 28 years ago at age 15 and built a successful business in Hawaii, where he lived with his wife and three children, all United States citizens. Lacking legal status, he had been permitted by immigration officials during the Obama administration to remain in the country while he pursued a path to legalization, but that decision was abruptly overturned this spring and he was ordered deported.\n\nNoting that Mr. Magana was \u201cby all accounts a pillar of his community,\u201d Judge Reinhardt said that \u201cthe government forces us to participate in ripping apart a family,\u201d adding that \u201ceven the \u2018good hombres\u2019 are not safe\u201d from the Trump administration\u2019s enforcement policy. His opinion concluded: \u201cMagana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not.\u201d\n\nAnd this week, a federal district judge in Sioux City, Iowa, Mark W. Bennett, denounced as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d the five-year mandatory minimum sentence he was forced to impose on a first-time drug offender, a grandmother of three, who became addicted to methamphetamine in her 50s and agreed to help her supplier distribute the drug in exchange for a place to sleep. Judge Bennett had tried and failed to persuade federal prosecutors to waive the mandatory minimum in this case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fairness, Judge Bennett has been a critic of mandatory minimum sentences for years, as have other federal judges. Criticism of federal sentencing policy long predates the Trump administration. In fact, it was just such criticism that was helping to drive a rare bipartisan movement toward criminal justice reform, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions stopped cold with his order to federal prosecutors last month to charge the \u201cmost serious, readily provable offense\u201d in every case, regardless of the circumstances. The attorney general\u2019s enablers on Capitol Hill have yet to extract from him an explanation for this disastrous policy turn, which in any event has been submerged by more obviously earthshaking developments in the intervening weeks. But there\u2019s no doubt that judges are noticing.\n\nAmong the president\u2019s tweets this week, those denouncing his own travel ban as \u201cwatered down\u201d and \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d and the courts as \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cslow,\u201d have received the most attention. (The tweets call it a travel ban, while the administration\u2019s Supreme Court petition calls it an \u201centry suspension.\u201d) But of all of the tweets, the one that grabbed me was one he issued after the London Bridge terrorist attack: \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights.\u201d\n\nWho does President Trump mean by \u201cus\u201d? And what rights have the courts taken away? I\u2019m wondering. And, I suspect, so are the judges. What we know as men. Women, too.", "publish_date": "2017-06-08", "authors": "Linda Greenhouse", "type": "article"}
