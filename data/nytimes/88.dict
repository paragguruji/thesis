And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people\u2019s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage.\n\n\u201cI think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization,\u201d Mr. Galston said.\n\nBreitbart, Aug. 2, 2015: Muslim Immigration Puts Half a Million U.S. Girls at Risk of Genital Mutilation\n\nOutside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla., Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news \u2014 first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates. Then, he scrolls through Facebook, where he\u2019s read stories about refugees who commit violent crimes against women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of them Facebook things where you see Muslim men are attacking women, and stuff like that, and having no respect for them at all. I\u2019ve got a real issue with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI see story after story after story, and I don\u2019t know how true it is.\u201d\n\nMr. Eason said he was skeptical of stories by unfamiliar websites like American News, but he reads them anyway. He commented on one that was posted to Facebook:\n\nFreedom\u2019s Final Stand, Oct. 3, 2016: Muslim Refugee Beats and Rapes Woman in North Dakota While Yelling \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019\n\nThe post, which was shared 14,000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d during the episode.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nSgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff\u2019s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an Arabic-sounding name is charged with a crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing and it\u2019s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news \u2014 the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: \u2018Send them back and get rid of them,\u2019 and, \u2018We don\u2019t need them.\u2019\u201d\n\nWorries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1,400 times:\n\nAmerican News, Jan. 11, 2016: Al Qaeda Terrorists That Killed Soldiers Have Entered the U.S. Disguised as Refugees\n\nAnd this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3,000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a cover-up:\n\nThe Daily Caller, Dec. 7, 2015: Homeland Security Chair: Obama Covering Up Evidence ISIS Is Targeting Refugee Plan\n\nThe actual number of refugees who have become extremists in the United States has been estimated at between three and 12 \u2014 out of the more than 800,000 who have resettled here since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe online stories about refugees range from outright fake news to those based on a grain of truth and then stretched out of proportion. For example, the Breitbart article about genital mutilation was based on a study that estimated that a half-million women currently living in the United States have had their genitals mutilated. But most of them were immigrants who had fled here because of such treatment in their home countries.\n\nMr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense.\n\nHe pointed to the vetting of Syrian refugees, for example, which is currently under review as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. As The New York Times has reported, the process involves dozens of layers of evaluation and can last up to two years.\n\nBut Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees\u2019 stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient.\n\n\u201cThey were saying with them coming from these areas, it\u2019s hard to vet them,\u201d Mr. Eason said. \u201cAnd it makes sense.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Caitlin Dickerson", "type": "article"}
