A quick survey by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, conducted three days after the executive order was issued, found that the repercussions in the business travel community were swift. Nearly four in 10 executives said the travel ban would curtail their company\u2019s business travel.\n\n\u201cPeople like certainty, travelers like certainty, companies like certainty,\u201d said Greeley Koch, the group\u2019s executive director. In the absence of that, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll just err on the side of caution and not take the trip.\u201d\n\nSteve Rudner, founder and managing partner at Rudner Law Offices, a firm that represents hotels, said that one corporate group of about 40 scheduled to arrive last Friday at a Florida hotel he represents canceled at the last minute over concerns that the company\u2019s chief executive, a Canadian resident with dual Canadian-Iranian citizenship, would not be able to enter the United States.\n\n\u201cAnytime, as a country, we throw up a sign that says certain people are not welcome, certain people will be detained or denied entry, there are many groups who will not want to risk denial of entry,\u201d Mr. Rudner said. He estimated the group could forfeit as much as $58,000 because of the last-minute cancellation. \u201cMany groups will just look to move the meeting elsewhere,\u201d he added.\n\nMichael W. McCormick, executive director and chief operating officer of the Global Business Travel Association, offered a similar prediction. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with a perception and whether people are going to postpone that trip or find another way in the near term to accomplish their business,\u201d he said.\n\nA member survey conducted online early last week found that nearly a third of travel managers said their companies were cutting back on business travel in the immediate aftermath of the order. More than half expressed worry that there would be uncertainty in the future about whether a green card or approved visa would be considered valid for entry to the United States, and more than one in four predicted that the executive order would lead to a long-term reduction in business travel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a concern \u2014 you start talking about that impact,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from companies is that there will be a short- and long-term impact and reduction in business travel.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor many meeting and convention organizers, the long lead time they need for planning means that even events not taking place for months are stuck in a holding pattern.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDebbie Baker, owner of an independent meeting planning company, said she was waiting to sign hotel contracts for a Las Vegas meeting scheduled for the fall. The client, a mining and generating company, has about 20 percent of its attendees coming from overseas. \u201cBecause they have offices in every country, they have V.P.s in every country as well,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Baker said she was worried that she could lose the client\u2019s business entirely. \u201cIf they canceled the meeting, it would be an astronomical amount of money I\u2019d lose,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might decide to hold it in Saudi Arabia or someplace like that, in which case I would lose the whole meeting.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At the biennial conclave of the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations in Tehran last week, where 300 to 400 professional tour guides from around the world gathered, a contingent from the Guides Association of New York City presented their group\u2019s bid to bring the event to New York in 2019.\n\n\u201cIf the entire vote was based on that evening, we would\u2019ve had it in the bag,\u201d said Matthew Baker, past president of the New York association and a member of the bid committee. \u201cThere was a tremendous amount of good feedback from everyone, especially our Iranian hosts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, word started trickling in about the travel ban, and the confidence turned to anxiety.\n\n\u201cI started receiving reports from my colleagues around the world \u2014 everyone was worried about getting a visa into the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cOne of our Iranian hosts was elected to the new executive board, so there was the concern about one of our executive board members not being able to attend a convention he was supposed to be organizing.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the roughly 50 delegates voting for the next convention site chose Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia over New York. Mr. Baker said the Iranian tour guides at the convention sympathized with his delegation\u2019s situation, noting their own challenges promoting their country as a tourist destination in the face of travel restrictions and sanctions.\n\nEven though a relatively small number of the participants were from the seven nations affected by the travel ban, delegates from other countries worried that this early signal from the new American administration foreshadowed potential trouble down the road.\n\n\u201cIf we can have a ban on seven countries now,\u201d Mr. Baker said, \u201cwhat can happen in the future?\u201d", "authors": ["Martha C.
