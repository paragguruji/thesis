Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, a group that has fought to stop same-sex marriage. \u201cQuite strangely, he is rewarding L.G.B.T. extremists who strongly opposed his election.\u201d\n\nRyan T. Anderson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who specializes in religious liberty, said, \u201cIn reality, what Trump issued today is rather weak.\u201d\n\nThe reaction from opponents was also telling. Two groups that had threatened to sue the White House over the new order, the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Citizen, backed off after seeing the text. Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U., called the signing of the order \u201can elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome.\u201d\n\nAnother group, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which promotes separation between church and state, did file a lawsuit in federal court in Wisconsin on Thursday, saying the president was favoring religious groups over secular nonprofits.\n\nThe two-page executive order does address religious objections to the Obama administration\u2019s mandate in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to cover contraceptives in their insurance plans. It directs the secretaries of the Treasury and the departments of labor and health and human services to \u201cconsider issuing amended regulations.\u201d\n\nTom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said Thursday that the department would be \u201ctaking action in short order to follow the president\u2019s instruction,\u201d but offered no details.\n\nThe executive order pleased the Roman Catholic nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor, who took their fight against the contraception mandate to the Supreme Court. The Obama administration had offered the Sisters a waiver to remove themselves from direct involvement in covering contraception, but the Sisters said it still violated their religious beliefs. The nuns and some conservative religious groups contend that some contraceptives induce abortions, and the mandate has been challenged in multiple court cases.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLori Windham, senior counsel at Becket, a law firm that represented the Little Sisters, said Thursday: \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the order today. The only way we\u2019d be disappointed is if the agencies did not carry it out.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

It\u2019s been a long, hard ordeal.\u201d\n\nMany of those in the audience were members of Mr. Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board, a group of pastors and ministry leaders who stood by him during his presidential campaign last year. They were treated to a celebratory dinner with Mr. Trump and members of his family in the White House on Wednesday night, and many of them came away saying they were thrilled.\n\nMr. Trump was expected to sign an executive order on religious liberty early in his first hundred days. A draft order that leaked in February was so sweeping that it set off alarm bells among liberal and gay rights groups, while delighting conservatives involved in conflicts over religious liberty.\n\nBut according to two senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid divulging their conversations with the president, that draft did not rise to the attention of Mr. Trump or his senior aides until some news outlets began reporting that the president might sign it. The White House then promptly issued a statement insisting that Mr. Trump was \u201cproud\u201d of his public statements in support of gay people. This week he told aides that his opinion on the matter had not changed, despite the pressure from some conservatives.\n\nThe order\u2019s biggest effects on religious life could come through its directives on partisan politicking by houses of worship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince 1954, the Johnson Amendment, promoted by Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, has threatened religious organizations and charities with loss of their tax-exempt status if they endorse or oppose political candidates. In reality, this was rarely enforced and the I.R.S. rarely investigated.\n\nThough Mr. Trump\u2019s order cannot change the law, it directs the Treasury Department not to take \u201cany adverse action\u201d against a violator \u201cto the extent permitted by law.\u201d\n\nLloyd Mayer, a Notre Dame law professor who specializes in churches, politics and tax law, said some would argue that the order \u201cdoesn\u2019t change anything, because the I.R.S. has been very wary of enforcing the Johnson Amendment.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cthere is the risk that it will open the door for people to create arguably fake churches \u2014 the Church of Obama, the Church of Trump \u2014 and use that as a mechanism to obtain anonymous, tax-deductible contributions which can then be spent on political activity.\u201d\n\nJennifer Copeland, executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches, and a United Methodist minister in Raleigh, said that she could foresee situations in which a donor offered to build a family life center for a church in exchange for supporting his favored candidate. \u201cThe church will become its own \u2018super PAC,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nA broad swath of religious leaders representing 99 religious organizations sent a letter to members of Congress last month urging them to preserve the Johnson Amendment. The signers included Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Unitarians, Quakers, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs and Hindus.\n\nEven evangelical leaders opposed lifting the restriction: A survey by the National Association of Evangelicals released in February found that 90 percent of their board members believed pastors should not endorse candidates from the pulpit.\n\nThe American public is also opposed. A poll by the Pew Research Center in 2016 found that though many Americans favor allowing churches and houses of worship to take positions on political and social issues, two-thirds are opposed to having churches endorse candidates. That percentage has held steady for eight years.", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein", "Michael D.
