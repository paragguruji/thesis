They cry every time she calls.\n\nIn Clarkston, Ga., a Somali mother fears for her daughter, 20, who was supposed to come on Feb. 6, but remains in a refugee camp in Kenya. The family had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed their home and raped and killed another daughter. That memory only makes things worse.\n\n\u201cI am unable to sleep or eat,\u201d the mother, Habibo Abdikadir Mohamed, 38, said through an interpreter this past week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure she will be safe. I\u2019ve already lost one daughter. I\u2019m worried I will lose another.\u201d\n\nExactly how many families are divided like these is not known. A United States government lawyer said Friday that 100,000 visas had been revoked, while the State Department said the number was closer to 60,000.\n\nThe rules are changing so fast, it\u2019s impossible to predict the fate of relatives left behind.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Mr. Trump signed the order suspending the resettlement of refugees from any country for four months, adding that Syrians seeking asylum would be barred indefinitely. Syrians and nationals from six other Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq and Somalia, would be unable to visit even if they had valid visas. Then, federal judges quashed the ban, at least temporarily. The State Department said it would allow refugees who had already been approved to fly to the United States, until Feb. 17.\n\nThere were nearly 20,000 people in that category \u2014 vetted and screened by multiple government agencies \u2014 according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency that arranged travel for the refugees. It was scrambling to get about 10 percent of them on planes to the United States in the next 10 days.\n\nThat didn\u2019t bring much comfort to Meathaq Alaunaibi of Iraq. Her husband worked for 10 years as a translator for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad. Their home was shelled in 2006, an attack that she believes was done by militants because of his work with American officials. Her husband\u2019s hand was burned by a car bomb in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, it took four years for their visa application to be approved, and last summer, the couple, their 15-year-old daughter and their 5-year-old son landed in Knoxville. But there was a new wrinkle. Because the process took so long, their twin daughters, Aisha and Fatima, had just turned 18. They were told that they would have to be screened anew. One is in medical school in Baghdad; the other is in dentistry school in Kirkuk. Ms. Alaunaibi calls them every day, even if only to tell them to wait.\n\n\u201cThey just cry. \u2018Why this happened to us? We love the U.S.A. We want to live in the U.S.A.,\u2019\u201d Ms. Alaunaibi, 45, said of their response. \u201cYou know, they are young, they are ambitious, they are smart and responsible. So this is a shock to them.\u201d\n\nMs. Mohamed, the Somali mother in Clarkston, was waiting anxiously to hear whether her eldest daughter would be among those who could come. Ms. Mohamed\u2019s family arrived in Georgia on Jan. 18, after 10 years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed her home and raped one of her daughters in front of her. Ms. Mohamed\u2019s sister and brother-in-law were killed, too, so she took in her sister\u2019s two children, in addition to her own seven.\n\nThe last of the family, Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 20, was scheduled to leave Kenya on Monday. But then came the ban last month. Her travel was canceled, she called to tell her parents. They could hear the grief in her voice.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always asking us, \u2018What do I do?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Mohamed\u2019s husband, Abdalla Ramadhan Munye. \u201cShe feels hurt that we left her behind. Only thing we can do is to listen to her and feel her pain.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

A businessman known for his opposition to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government, her father was picked up in July 2013, while Ms. Mustafa was in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer plans changed immediately. There was no chance of going back to Syria. She slept on the sofas of strangers who took her in. She applied for political asylum in the United States, and quickly got it.\n\nTo make ends meet, she worked as a hostess at a restaurant, then as a live-in babysitter. Through friends of friends, she landed a full scholarship at Bard College in upstate New York. She graduated last year.\n\nHer mother, Lamia Zreik, has not been as lucky. She fled with her other two daughters, Wafa and Ghena, after her husband was detained in 2013. They went to Gaziantep, Turkey \u2014 the border town now home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians \u2014 and in 2014, hoping to join Sana, applied for resettlement to the United States.\n\nThey were interviewed four times \u2014 by United Nations officials, then by American officials. One year passed, then two. When Wafa, who had been supporting the family, got a chance to go to Germany, Ms. Zreik told her that she couldn\u2019t possibly pass it up.\n\n\u201cWe had two options \u2014 either she stays or I work,\u201d Ms. Zreik said by telephone from Gaziantep, where she works with Syrian children orphaned by the war. \u201cAnd the first wasn\u2019t really an option.\u201d\n\nIn early January, the first bad news came: an email informing Ms. Zreik that she and her daughter would have to undergo more security screenings.\n\nMs. Mustafa was visiting Gaziantep at the time. \u201cThree years wasn\u2019t enough for screening?\u201d she said. \u201cI was very devastated. I was actually very angry.\u201d\n\nFor a while, neither of them told Ghena, 16, the bad news. Then came the executive order.\n\nMs. Mustafa said Ghena had taken it the hardest. \u201cShe was very sad,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said: \u2018We\u2019re not going anywhere. No one is taking us.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe family has applied for resettlement to France and Canada. Wafa, 26 and studying in Berlin, said she could not sponsor them to Germany until she could prove she could support them financially. Wafa\u2019s own good fortune weighs on her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about this every day,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to find a way to help my mom and my sister.\u201d\n\nFor now, there\u2019s no place they can be together.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t express my deep anger,\u201d Ms. Zreik said. \u201cWe are a small family. Without my husband, and each girl in a different country, we can\u2019t see each other.\u201d", "authors": ["Somini Sengupta"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["mother", "good", "took", "ban", "divided", "guilt", "fortune", "refugee", "family", "encounter", "united", "zreik", "ms", "mustafa", "reading", "states", "daughter", "daughters", "mothers"], "summary": "A United States government lawyer said Friday that 100,000 visas had been revoked, while the State Department said the number was closer to 60,000.\nThe State Department said it would allow refugees who had already been approved to fly to the United States, until Feb. 17.\nIt was scrambling to get about 10 percent of them on planes to the United States in the next 10 days.\nHer husband worked for 10 years as a translator for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad.\nMs. Mustafa received a six-week fellowship funded by the State Department to visit Washington in the summer of 2013."}
