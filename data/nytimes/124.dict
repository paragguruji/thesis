They are the pillars of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe comments came a day after President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who unlike Ms. Merkel is not running for re-election this year, said he had reminded Mr. Trump of his \u201cconviction that the ongoing fight to defend our democracy will be effective only if we sign up to respect to the founding principles and, in particular, the welcoming of refugees.\u201d\n\nMr. Seibert said Ms. Merkel had explained her stance to Mr. Trump, even though statements released in Washington and Berlin hours after their conversation made no mention of Ms. Merkel\u2019s views on the executive order that the president signed on Friday.\n\nInstead, in notably spare tones, the statements suggested that the two had agreed to cooperate in reinforcing NATO and a trans-Atlantic alliance that Mr. Trump has questioned, most recently in an interview with European newspapers days before his inauguration, in which he called the alliance \u201cobsolete.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel reacted coolly to Mr. Trump\u2019s election in November, offering close cooperation only on the basis of shared values such as equal treatment for all, with no discrimination on the basis of faith, political views, sexual orientation or ethnic origin. Her stance on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was in line with that approach.\n\nMs. Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany and is the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, has invoked that background in justifying her decision to allow more than one million asylum seekers, many of them Muslims, into Germany since 2015.\n\nIn his interview with Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper and The Times of London, Mr. Trump was strongly critical of Ms. Merkel\u2019s refugee policy. \u201cI think she made one very catastrophic mistake, and that was taking all of these illegals, you know, taking all of the people from wherever they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody even knows where they come from.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nTheinflux of refugees has hurt the chancellor politically and aided the rise of a far-right party that has ridden anti-migrant and anti-Muslim sentiment to capture seats in 10 of Germany\u2019s 16 state legislatures.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe party, Alternative for Germany, seems certain to enter the federal parliament after the Sept. 24 elections, which will follow crucial votes in the Netherlands and France this spring and help determine whether a weakened Europe can maintain its unity.\n\nA spokesman for Mrs. May, who was not identified by name under traditional ground rules, said that if Mr. Trump\u2019s policy affects British citizens, as it will for people who are citizens of two countries, \u201cthen clearly we will make representations to the U.S. government about that.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She had flown there she after becoming the first foreign leader to meet with the new American president, a source of pride for Downing Street.\n\nAfter meeting Turkish leaders, she was asked several times by British journalists about her reaction to the executive order. She refused to condemn the policy and finally said \u2014 after reporters shouted, \u201cAnswer the question!\u201d \u2014 that \u201cthe United States is responsible for the United States\u2019 policy on refugees. The United Kingdom is responsible for the United Kingdom\u2019s policy on refugees.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson took a harder line in a Twitter post on Sunday. \u201cWe will protect the rights and freedoms of UK nationals home and abroad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDivisive and wrong to stigmatize because of nationality.\u201d\n\nOne person likely to be affected is a British sports hero, the Olympic champion runner Mo Farah. He was born in Somalia and came to Britain at age 8, and he may not be able to return to his training base and home in Oregon, where his family lives.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, posted a photograph of Mrs. May and Mr. Trump on Twitter, writing: \u201chand in hand with the man who banned Mo Farah & Tory MP. Yet she remains silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home,\u201d Mr. Farah wrote on Facebook, \u201cto explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order was preceded on Friday by an emotional appeal from the mayor of Berlin, related to another proposal by Mr. Trump that has proved polarizing \u2014 the construction of a wall along the United States border with Mexico.\n\n\u201cBerlin, the city of Europe\u2019s division, the city of Europe\u2019s freedom, cannot silently look on as a country sets about building a new wall,\u201d the mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe Berliners know better than most the pain caused when a whole continent is split by barbed wire and walls. Our division destroyed the prospects of millions. But ultimately, we, the people, overcame it,\u201d he wrote, recalling the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989.\n\nMr. M\u00fcller took the unusual step of invoking another United States president, Ronald Reagan, in appealing to Mr. Trump to tear down walls rather than build new ones.", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Alison Smale", "type": "article"}
