Trump: Be Careful What You Wish For", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/judges-v-trump-be-careful-what-you-wish-for.html?mcubz=0", "text": "The Ninth Circuit held that the travel ban violated the due-process rights of aliens. While it may be true that green-card holders (and certain temporarily admitted aliens) cannot be blocked from entry based on a general \u201cnational interest\u201d determination, the due-process rights of other foreigners not already on American soil are exceedingly limited.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor this group of aliens, the travel ban did not violate due-process rights. The court could have given Mr. Trump an easy victory by protecting only green-card holders (and the temporarily admitted aliens) from the ban, as the government suggested it do.\n\nThe court refused because the government failed to make clear in the executive order that green-card holders would be exempted. But this is a non sequitur. As the respected former federal appellate judge Michael McConnell notes, the ban\u2019s challengers were legally entitled to a judicial order that blocked only illegal portions of the ban.\n\nBy resting on due process, the court was able to block the travel ban without addressing a more explosive argument. The court noted that \u201cthe states have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 \u201d but declined to resolve this claim \u201cin light of the sensitive interests involved.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csensitive interests\u201d did not hold back a Federal District Court in Virginia. In an opinion issued on Monday, the court ruled that the president acted with animus against Muslims when he issued the travel ban. The court laid out the damning evidence: the campaign statement calling for a Muslim ban, which is still on the web; Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s acknowledgment that the travel ban was really a Muslim ban; the failure of the lawyers who wrote the ban to consult national-security officials; and Mr. Trump\u2019s statements in interviews.\n\nThis is surely the first time in history that a court has found that a president acted out of bigotry. Yet the ruling contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that courts may not \u201clook behind\u201d a \u201cfacially legitimate\u201d reason \u2014 here, the national security interest in stricter vetting \u2014 when the president exercises immigration authority.\n\nDoes this mean President Trump is right to complain that the courts are political? Not exactly. The courts were playing politics, but of a valid constitutional kind.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

They know about Mr. Trump\u2019s reckless and erratic behavior \u2014 indeed, they have been on the receiving end of it. After losing the lower court case in Washington State, President Trump called the judge, James L. Robart, a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d The president later tweeted, \u201cIf something happens blame him and court system.\u201d With hardly a pause, President Trump implied that the Ninth Circuit was biased (\u201cI won\u2019t call it biased,\u201d he said. \u201cBut courts seem to be so political\u201d) before it decided the case. In another tweet, he blasted the judges for their \u201cdisgraceful decision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJames Madison rooted the separation of powers in the \u201cpersonal motives\u201d of the officers in one branch \u201cto resist encroachments\u201d of the other branches. If one branch attacks another, the latter will attack back. Weren\u2019t the Ninth Circuit panel and the Virginia court acting in good Madisonian fashion?\n\nMr. Trump warns that if the courts constantly look over his shoulder, he won\u2019t be able to protect us from security threats. The Virginia court, having established Mr. Trump\u2019s bigotry, has placed him on probation, preparing the way for challenges to any future executive actions against Muslim countries.\n\nBut the blame lies with Mr. Trump. Having used the pretext of national security to indulge his hostility to a vulnerable group and lacking self-discipline and professionalism, he has lost the confidence of the courts, just as he may have lost the confidence of intelligence agents he compared to Nazis. The president\u2019s authority rests on trust and discretion, not on triumph of the will.\n\nBut there is a problem: Courts have historically deferred to the president on national-security matters because the president acts on the basis of classified information and may need to move quickly.\n\nIf courts are now creating a \u201cTrump exception\u201d to settled law on presidential powers, we should also remember that our safety depends on a return to the era in which the courts \u2014 and intelligence agents \u2014 trusted the president\u2019s word. And if a terrorist attack does happen, as the president suggested in a tweet, he might feel empowered to defy the courts.\n\nWhile we might celebrate the court\u2019s alertness to its institutional prerogatives, we should also be aware of the high stakes and risks in this clash between the executive and the judiciary.", "publish_date": "2017-02-15", "authors": "Eric Posner", "type": "article"}
