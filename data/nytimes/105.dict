The film\u2019s screenplay had to be approved by the Iranian government, which also chose the film as the country\u2019s official submission to the Academy Awards.\n\nMarcel Mettelsiefen, the director of \u201cWatani: My Homeland,\u201d an Oscar-nominated documentary, said the film\u2019s Syrian protagonist, Hala Kamil, would not be able to travel to the Oscars ceremony because she has a Syrian and a German refugee passport.\n\nThe film follows Ms. Kamil and her children as they seek asylum in Germany. \u201cIt is very sad she cannot come,\u201d Mr. Mettelsiefen said. \u201cShe is the star of the movie.\u201d\n\nMs. Kamil has been a frequent visitor to the United States, even giving a speech on the plight of refugees at the United Nations in August.\n\nHussein Hassan, the Kurdish director of the feature \u201cReseba \u2014 The Dark Wind,\u201d which was to have its North American premiere at the Miami Film Festival next month, said he had withdrawn his visa application to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s policy.\n\nThe film\u2019s producer and one of its screenwriters, Mehmet Aktas, said the movie, a drama about a bride-to-be who survives an attack by ISIS on her village, showed that not all Muslims are terrorists. Festival organizers have said they still planned to show \u201cThe Dark Wind.\u201d\n\nPhilip Himberg, the artistic director of the Sundance Institute Theater Program, said he feared the visa ban would shut down a fruitful workshop exchange for theater professionals from the Middle East and North Africa. Since it started in 2012, about 60 Arabic-language professionals have attended the workshops in Utah, Wyoming, Berlin and Morocco.\n\n\u201cIt shatters my heart,\u201d Mr. Himberg said. He added that the program was supported by a grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Trust, and the Sundance Institute didn\u2019t know what would happen if the artists the grant was intended to bring to the United States could no longer travel there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ban is also expected to affect museums. Curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art said the order could disrupt or limit its loans to and from the affected countries and would restrict travel by colleagues and artists to the United States for education, research, fellowships, workshops, conferences and other training. They said it might also scuttle their hoped-for archaeological surveys and excavations in partnership with Iraq and Iran, and a joint publication project on Nishapur with Iran.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s move is \u201cparticularly ironic, given that the earliest formulation of what we recognize today as the concept of habeas corpus was expressed in the Codex Hammurabi, an ancient Iraqi monument about justice, set up in public so that all citizens could access their rights,\u201d said Kim Benzel, the curator in charge of the museum\u2019s Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the many contributions of Iraq to the world, and in this case, to democracy itself,\u201d she added. \u201cWhere and how did things go so wrong?\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said: \u201cWe have no idea yet how this might affect us, but we do have at least one important exhibition of art mostly from Iran that would be impacted by travel restrictions that would make it difficult to do research and work with artists and authors, as well as borrow works of art that would require couriers from collections in Iran.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of the actors, Mohammad Aghebatian, an Iranian citizen who trained at Yale, is now in Iran and uncertain whether he will be allowed to return to the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is completely and utterly un-American,\u201d said Arian Moayed, an actor who is a founder and an artistic director of Waterwell. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what to do \u2014 we\u2019re trying to find him a lawyer.\u201d\n\nShari Rezai, a concert promoter in Los Angeles who specializes in contemporary Persian music and brings artists from Iran and elsewhere to the United States, said she had six shows planned through June, and canceled all of them three days ago, when she heard about the impending ban. She worried that her seven-year-old business was now at risk.\n\n\u201cTonight I have a concert in L.A.,\u201d she said, with an American-born Iranian artist, Fared Shafinury, whose band has some immigrant members. \u201cI\u2019m just so afraid that this is going to be my last concert.\u201d\n\nLawyers are struggling to understand what the visa ban means. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot in here that is subject to interpretation,\u201d said Jonathan Ginsburg, an immigration lawyer in Virginia who specializes in visas for artists and performers. He said the language made clear that nationals from the seven countries \u201cappear to be banned for 90 days, even if they have applied for and received a U.S. visa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added: \u201cThe flip side is that we may not appreciate just how broadly worded these things are until someone decides to interpret them more aggressively.\u201d\n\nFor now, many artists from affected countries who are legal residents in the United States say they can\u2019t leave the country for fear of not being able to return. Shahpour Pouyan, an Iranian artist living in New York under a green card whose work is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said he would be unable to travel to Toronto for a group exhibit or to Paris for a solo exhibition in March.\n\n\u201cI am stuck here. I can\u2019t leave the country and as an artist it means I can\u2019t make shows and present my works internationally,\u201d he wrote in an email message. \u201cThis is such a mess.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Rachel Donadio", "type": "article"}
