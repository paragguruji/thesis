In the video, the man is seen clapping his hands and shouting at other passengers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe says in part: \u201cDonald Trump, baby! We got some Hillary bitches on here?\u201d\n\nThe man also yelled: \u201cDonald Trump! It\u2019s your president. Every goddamn one of you. If you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\u201d\n\nA Daily Beast writer was also provided with a copy of the video.\n\nMs. Baum said the man was briefly removed from the plane and then allowed back on the flight before it took off. She said she reported him to the authorities when the plane landed.\n\nAfter the video was posted online, Delta Air Lines issued a statement on Nov. 26, apologizing to customers for the disruption and saying, \u201cWe have followed up with the teams involved and all agree that this customer should not have been allowed to continue on the flight.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Canada Letter Newsletter Every week, receive a handpicked selection of news and opinion plus exclusive commentary from New York Times journalists.

He will never again be allowed on a Delta plane.\u201d\n\nThe video was shared widely online, with many commentators noting that the man, who is white, was not ejected from the flight, but that passengers who are Muslim, Sikh, African-American and other races and ethnicities have been subjected to extra scrutiny or outright removal by various airlines while engaging in routine activities.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what, if any measures, were taken at the airport in Allentown when the man disembarked. Assistant Chief Gail Struss of the Allentown Police Department said in an email on Monday: \u201cIt\u2019s possible we were called, but no report was taken by us that I can find. We would have referred the caller to the airport police.\u201d\n\nOfficers at the Police Department at the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority were not dispatched to respond to any passenger disturbance on Nov. 22, a spokesman, Colin Riccobon, said in an email.", "publish_date": "2016-11-28", "authors": "Christine Hauser", "type": "article"}
