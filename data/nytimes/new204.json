Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power.\n\nLawyers for the administration were ordered to submit a brief on Monday defending Mr. Trump\u2019s order temporarily banning refugees from around the world and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. An appeals court in California refused on Sunday to reinstate the ban after a lower court blocked it.\n\nAs people from the countries targeted by Mr. Trump struggled to make their way to the United States while they could, the president for the second day in a row expressed rage at the judge in the case, this time accusing him of endangering national security. Vice President Mike Pence defended the president\u2019s tone, but lawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances.\n\nLate in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to pre-emptively blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, a day after referring to the \u201cso-called judge\u201d in the case. \u201cIf something happens blame him and court system.\u201d\n\nEven before the latest post, Republicans joined Democrats in chiding him. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said it was \u201cbest not to single out judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all get disappointed from time to time,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\u201d\n\nThe White House offered no evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that potential terrorists would now pour over the border because of the judge\u2019s order. Since Sept. 11, 2001, no American has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone who immigrated from any of the seven countries named in Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nVideo In January, President Trump blocked travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, and cut refugee admissions by more than half. We checked the facts.\n\nThe impassioned debate over the immigration order brought to the fore issues at the heart of the Trump presidency. A businessman with no experience in public office, Mr. Trump has shown in his administration\u2019s opening days that he favors an action-oriented approach with little regard for the two other branches of government. While Congress, controlled by Republicans, has deferred, the judiciary may emerge as the major obstacle for Mr. Trump.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans said Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on the courts would color the battle over the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as well as the president\u2019s relationship with Congress.\n\nOther presidents have clashed with the judiciary. The Supreme Court invalidated parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, forced Richard M. Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes and rejected Bill Clinton\u2019s bid to delay a sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nThe last two presidents battled with courts repeatedly over the limits of their power. The judiciary ruled that George W. Bush overstepped his bounds in denying due process to terrorism suspects and that Barack Obama assumed power he did not have to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country.\n\nCharles Fried, solicitor general under Ronald Reagan, said the ruling by a Federal District Court in Washington State blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s order resembled a ruling by a Texas district court stopping Mr. Obama from proceeding with his own immigration order.\n\nBut rarely, if ever, has a president this early in his tenure, and with such personal invective, battled the courts. Mr. Trump, Mr. Fried said, is turning everything into \u201ca soap opera\u201d with overheated attacks on the judge. \u201cThere are no lines for him,\u201d said Mr. Fried, who teaches at Harvard Law School and voted against Mr. Trump. \u201cThere is no notion of, this is inappropriate, this is indecent, this is unpresidential.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans brushed off the attacks, noting that judges have lifetime tenure that protects them from criticism. But even some Republicans said Mr. Trump\u2019s order raised valid legal questions for the courts.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the White House, I\u2019d feel better about my position if the ban or moratorium or whatever you call it were based on an actual attack or threat,\u201d former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, who served under Mr. Bush, said in an interview. Still, he said, when it comes to noncitizens overseas, \u201cthe executive has enjoyed great deference from the courts.\u201d\n\nJudge James Robart, a Federal District Court judge in Seattle appointed by Mr. Bush, on Friday issued a nationwide suspension of Mr. Trump\u2019s order while its legality was debated. The administration quickly asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overrule the judge, but it refused early Sunday and instead ordered the government to file a brief on Monday. The quick briefing schedule indicated that the appeals court could issue a ruling on the merits of the president\u2019s order within days.\n\nIn the meantime, refugees vetted by the government can proceed to the United States, as can any travelers with approved visas from the seven targeted nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nStill, widespread confusion and anger were reported at overseas airports on Sunday. Unsure which orders to follow, airlines stopped even some of the people named in the lawsuits who were technically cleared to come to the country, according to a government official.\n\nThe assertion of broad latitude by the president in areas of national security resembles the struggles of the Bush years, when in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks the administration claimed sometimes sweeping power in the name of fighting terrorism.\n\nJack Goldsmith, who as head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Bush argued that some of the initial orders went too far and forced them to be rolled back, said on Sunday that there were similarities. \u201cBut Bush\u2019s legal directives were not as sloppy as Trump\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump\u2019s serial attacks on judges and the judiciary take us into new territory. The sloppiness and aggressiveness of the directives, combined with the attacks on judges, put extra pressure on judges to rule against Trump.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time Mr. Trump has castigated a judge who ruled against him. As a candidate last year, Mr. Trump asserted that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was presiding over a fraud lawsuit by former students of Trump University, had a conflict of interest because his family was of Mexican heritage and he therefore would be biased because of Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a border wall.\n\nSuch comments from a sitting president, however, were unusual and triggered consternation in the legal community. Bartholomew J. Dalton, the president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cinsulting language\u201d inappropriate.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for the chief executive of the executive branch to demean a member of the judiciary with such language,\u201d Mr. Dalton said in a statement. \u201cThis undermines judicial independence, which is the backbone to our constitutional democracy.\u201d\n\nSenators of both parties appearing on Sunday talk shows concurred. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t understand language like that,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC. \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges. We don\u2019t have so-called senators. We don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is not a dictator,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe framers of our Constitution wanted a strong Congress for the very reason that most of these kinds of things should be done within the scope of lawmaking. This is done within the scope of executive power.\u201d\n\nIt fell to Mr. Pence to defend Mr. Trump. \u201cWell, look, the president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government. And we have a long tradition of that in this country,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC.\n\n\u201cThe judge\u2019s actions in this case,\u201d he added, \u201cmaking decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it\u2019s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.
