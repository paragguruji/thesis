Scott Kirby, president of United Airlines, was asked at a recent conference if the terrorist attacks in Britain had had any impact on demand for flights to that country. The short answer, he said, was no. \u201cThey\u2019re terrible, that these events happen,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cAnd in a way, even worse is that they\u2019re happening with such regularity that there isn\u2019t much impact, that people are almost becoming numb, perhaps.\u201d\n\nEven in the last two weeks, as London faced a new attack and Mr. Trump took to Twitter to repeat his support of a travel ban, there have been few hints that travelers are throwing out their plans. Major American carriers plan to increase seat capacity on international routes in the last four months of the year, according to airline analysts at Wolfe Research.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen that hard pullback that I think some might have anticipated,\u201d said Chris Jones, chief marketing officer at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.\n\nLast week at Kennedy International Airport in New York, the nation\u2019s busiest destination for international passengers, several travelers expressed resolve.\n\nAugustina Spina, who lives in Manhattan, was lingering outside Terminal 7 with a friend before an evening flight to London.

In addition to the president\u2019s executive orders, now blocked by the courts, the administration has banned electronic devices larger than a cellphone in the cabins of direct, inbound flights from airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries over fears that they could be used to conceal bombs.\n\nEmirates Airlines has attributed some fallout to Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. The carrier, which had been aggressively expanding its high-end service to the United States, announced plans to reduce the number of flights to five American cities after it saw a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in bookings.\n\n\u201cThe recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S.,\u201d Jerome Demare, a spokesman for Emirates, wrote in an email.\n\nPhoto\n\nHotel executives who gathered this week at the conference in New York, the New York University International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, suggested that the consequences of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies could just be beginning.\n\n\u201cWords matter \u2014 perceptions matter,\u201d said Jonathan M. Tisch, the chief executive of Loews Hotels. \u201cAnd the way the administration\u2019s policies are portrayed to the world matters.\u201d\n\nSarah Murov, a spokeswoman for Loews, said the company was seeing declines this summer in bookings by travelers from many international destinations, not just the Middle East. She noted that the company\u2019s hotels host a number of groups that have international attendees and \u201cwe have seen greater wash and cancellations from this segment.\u201d\n\nThe pullback has not yet been reflected in the company\u2019s financial results. Revenue for the first three months of the year were essentially flat from the same period last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA similar story is playing out at Marriott. Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for that company, said it had not seen any \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on its financial performance from a decline in tourists to the United States.\n\nStill, the anxiety is there. Arne Sorenson, the president and chief executive of Marriott, warned at the conference last week that the numbers of travelers to the United States would \u201clook worse\u201d over the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see more people go to Europe and other destinations,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere the reception seems to be warmer.\u201d", "authors": ["Micah Maidenberg"], "publish_date": "2017-06-20", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "industry", "international", "mr", "conference", "bags", "travelers", "united", "week", "awaits", "slowdown", "impact", "airlines", "york", "pack", "way"], "summary": "A Bloomberg index of stocks for airlines based in the United States has risen 6.5 percent since the start of the year.\nShares in United Airlines, which faced major public relations problems after the rough treatment of a passenger in April, are up 6.3 percent since the start of 2017.\nPhotoJ.
