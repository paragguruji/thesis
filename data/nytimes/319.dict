The biggest decline is in applications from the Middle East.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany officials cited worries among prospective students about Trump administration immigration policies. \u201cInternational student recruitment professionals report a great deal of concern from students all over the globe,\u201d the study said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the federal judge in Hawaii who blocked the latest version of the administration\u2019s travel ban cited the financial harm the executive order posed to the state\u2019s university system, which recruits students and hires faculty members from the six target countries. (Washington State officials raised similar concerns in successfully challenging the first travel ban.)\n\nGraduate schools appear to be feeling the worst pinch, with nearly half reporting drops. \u201cOur deans describe it as a chilling effect,\u201d said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.\n\nThe numbers \u2014 while not yet final \u2014 are provoking anxiety in some programs that rely on international students, who bring more than $32 billion a year into the United States economy. International enrollment at American colleges has been on the rise over the past decade, and for the first time exceeded one million students last year.\n\nStill, despite the steady increase, the movement of students from one country to another is sensitive to fluctuations tied to political and economic forces. So some officials cautioned that a \u201cTrump effect\u2019 is just one possible explanation for this year\u2019s application figures. Beyond that, many schools, including New York University, the University of Southern California and Northeastern University, reported that their international numbers are up. Purdue University reported a 1.2 percent decline in graduate school applications.\n\nMr. Wiewel made his trip to Hyderabad not long after residents of the city held funeral services for a young Indian man who was killed in a bar in Olathe, Kan., where he worked as an engineer. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wiewel reassured the students \u2014 all admitted to Portland State\u2019s graduate engineering program \u2014 that his university\u2019s environment was safe and welcoming. He was a bit surprised by their concerns, he said, because students he visited earlier in New Delhi and Bangalore had been more anxious about financing their graduate studies, apparently a reaction to India\u2019s recent currency shortage. Other economic factors may also be involved in the application declines, Ms. Ortega said, including crude oil prices in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso at play: uncertainty about the future of a visa program called H-1B that international graduates frequently rely on to remain in the United States to work.\n\nFor several graduate schools, the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which initially affected seven predominantly Muslim countries, could not have been more poorly timed. It was announced in late January as deadlines loomed for applications to some graduate programs, and it came on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The university will not have problems filling the programs, but the drop might affect the overall quality of the applicant pool, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOhio State has also seen an increase in international undergraduate applications but a significant overall drop \u2014 8.4 percent \u2014 in international applicants to its graduate programs, a university spokesman, Chris Davey, said. The biggest decline was among students from China \u2014 a fact Mr. Davey said did not support the \u201cTrump effect\u201d theory. In 2016, he said, there were 2,412 graduate applications from China; this year the number was down to 1,952.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re inclined to say that the overarching factors that might be influencing this are probably global economic factors and it would be premature to conclude that it\u2019s the travel ban,\u201d Mr. Davey said. \u201cBut it certainly could be.\u201d\n\nBecause application deadlines at several larger colleges had passed before Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban was announced, some universities are more worried about the \u201cyield\u201d \u2014 the number of students offered admission who end up enrolling, said Frances Leslie, vice provost for the graduate division at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nApplications at Irvine are not down, but students have expressed concerned about coming to the United States, Ms. Leslie said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from students, even beyond the seven countries, expressing concern,\u201d Ms. Leslie said, referring to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which were singled out in the first travel ban. \u201cThis year, even when students are admitted, they may not be willing to accept the offers.\u201d\n\nThe university will not have those numbers until April 15, a national deadline for students to make a decision.\n\nAt Portland State, where undergraduate international applications are up 4 percent but international graduate applications are down 15 percent, the vice provost for international affairs, Margaret Everett, said she had heard recently from a Chinese student who canceled his application, citing the political climate.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned about the climate and the rhetoric and the administration policies and travel ban,\u201d Ms. Everett said.", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Stephanie Saul", "type": "article"}
