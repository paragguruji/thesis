The court divided along ideological lines, with the three Republican appointees in dissent.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory said Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail concerning Muslims showed that the revised order was the product of religious hostility. Such discrimination, he wrote, violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion.\n\n\u201cThen-candidate Trump\u2019s campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States,\u201d Gregory wrote. He cited, as an example, a 2015 statement calling for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration had urged the appeals court to ignore the statements as loose language made before the president assumed office. But Gregory said the court could take account of the comments.\n\n\u201cThe campaign statements here are probative of purpose because they are closely related in time, attributable to the primary decisionmaker, and specific and easily connected to the challenged action,\u201d Gregory wrote.\n\nThe administration had argued that consideration of campaign rhetoric would chill political speech protected by the First Amendment. That was not a problem, Gregory said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that our review chills campaign promises to condemn and exclude entire religious groups, we think that a welcome restraint,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPeter Baker contributed reporting.\n\n", "source": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u4e2d\u6587\u7f51 \u56fd\u9645\u7eb5\u89c8", "publish_date": "2017-05-26", "type": "article"}
