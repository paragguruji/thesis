The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the president\u2019s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe.\u201d", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "publish_date": "2017-04-20", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["hawaii", "island", "email", "dismisses", "state", "judge", "sessions", "united", "states", "pacific", "attorney", "jeff", "mr"], "summary": "Sessions said this week in an interview on \u201cThe Mark Levin Show,\u201d a conservative talk radio program.\nAnnexed as a territory of the United States in the late 19th century, Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959.\n\u201cHawaii was built on the strength of diversity & immigrant experiences \u2014 including my own,\u201d Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cJeff Sessions\u2019 comments are ignorant & dangerous.\u201dAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe other senator from Hawaii, Brian Schatz, who is also a Democrat, expressed similar sentiments, writing on Twitter: \u201cMr.\nSessions, Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said in an email: \u201cHawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific \u2014 a beautiful one where the attorney general\u2019s granddaughter was born."}
