Kissinger\u2019s oft-repeated line that Iran needed to decide whether it is a \u201cnation or a cause.\u201d\n\nWhile those sections passed muster with the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, one person close to the process said, they ran into resistance from Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, who is among those advocating a tougher line against Iran. Mr. Bannon, an administration official said, \u201cgutted the most ridiculous material\u201d after arguing that Mr. Trump should not send the message at all.\n\nThe two people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House deliberations.\n\nThe Trump administration has already taken a harder line than the Obama administration. In February, General McMaster\u2019s predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, put the Iranians \u201con notice\u201d after they tested a ballistic missile, saying it undermined \u201csecurity, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East,\u201d and placed \u201cAmerican lives at risk.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster is viewed as more pragmatic than Mr. Flynn. He told his staff early on, for example, that he did not view the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d as helpful. But that has not stopped Mr. Trump from using it in his speeches \u2014 a habit that shows the influence of Mr. Bannon, who views Iran and China as America\u2019s great adversaries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He did not mention Iran, let alone use its formal name, the Islamic Republic of Iran, as Mr. Obama did.\n\n\u201cThis is a message designed to put the regime on the defensive,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama on Iran. \u201cIt is smart and well crafted with clear messages in mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong those messages was one of reassurance to the Iranian diaspora, which has been affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order barring visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. In a few well-publicized cases, it sundered families that had hoped to get together for the holiday.\n\nThe statement praised Iranian-Americans as \u201cone of the most successful immigrant groups in our country\u2019s contemporary American history.\u201d It made a point of noting that in addition to Islam, these immigrants come from Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian and Bahai backgrounds \u2014 all religions that have faced some type of repression in postrevolution Iran.\n\nMr. Trump claimed \u201cwonderful friendships with Iranian-Americans.\u201d His director of Jewish outreach during the campaign was an Orthodox Jewish immigrant from Iran, David Peyman.\n\nCritics of the administration said Mr. Trump\u2019s warm sentiments did nothing to ease the pain of families split by his travel ban.\n\n\u201cEmpty words disgrace the one who speaks them, like serving a walnut shell without the nut,\u201d said the National Iranian American Council, quoting a 13th-century Persian poet, Saadi.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the White House videotaped Nowruz messages from the president and used them as a diplomatic tool. In the first video, Mr. Obama addressed himself to the \u201cpeople and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d That phrase was important because it effectively put to rest the idea that regime change was American policy.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Obama offered to engage with the leadership of Iran after decades of estrangement. He followed up the holiday greetings with letters to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In subsequent years, Mr. Obama continued to send Nowruz video greetings, though they were never as bluntly political as the first one.\n\n\u201cThe Nowruz messages have historically been occasions when the White House limits itself to good year wishes,\u201d said Ray Takeyh, an expert on Iran at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt was during the Obama administration that they were infused with political content, as the White House was searching for ways to reach out to the Iranian government. So in many ways, the Trump administration\u2019s message is restoring a pre-existing tradition.\u201d\n\nNowruz greetings typically end with a quotation from a Persian poet. But for Mr. Trump, the White House found a saying attributed to a leader of the ancient Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great, who appeared to share the president\u2019s respect for material success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFreedom, dignity and wealth together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity,\u201d Mr. Trump quoted Cyrus as saying. \u201cIf you bequeath all three to your people, their love for you will never die.\u201d", "authors": ["Mark Landler"], "publish_date": "2017-03-23", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["leaves", "iran", "administration", "message", "nowruz", "trump", "iranian", "greeting", "obama", "house", "white", "mr", "messages"], "summary": "Mr. Bannon, an administration official said, \u201cgutted the most ridiculous material\u201d after arguing that Mr. Trump should not send the message at all.\nThe two people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal White House deliberations.\nThe Trump administration has already taken a harder line than the Obama administration.\nDuring the Obama administration, the White House videotaped Nowruz messages from the president and used them as a diplomatic tool.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cFreedom, dignity and wealth together constitute the greatest happiness of humanity,\u201d Mr. Trump quoted Cyrus as saying."}
