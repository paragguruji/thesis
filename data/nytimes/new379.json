In most cases, the authoritative statements of the legal positions of the United States are contained in official settings and documents like the arguments and briefs presented to courts by the Department of Justice. Privileging such documents ensures that the careful processes and expertise they reflect are not overshadowed by casual presidential utterances or ill-considered tweets.\n\nThe judges who have objected to using Mr. Trump\u2019s words against him in the travel ban litigation have been motivated by such concerns. Alex Kozinski, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which in February affirmed an order halting the initial travel ban, took particular issue with his colleagues\u2019 use of campaign speech, noting that \u201cthe panel has approved open season on anything a politician or his staff may have said.\u201d Judge Paul V. Niemeyer of the Fourth Circuit, dissenting from last week\u2019s opinion, agreed, expressing alarm that in the future a court could \u201chave free rein to select whichever expression of a candidate\u2019s developing ideas best supports its desired conclusion.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Nicholas Kristof Newsletter Receive emails about each column and other occasional commentary.

And to a point they\u2019re correct on the merits: The speech of a president should not usually be relevant to a court\u2019s determination of the meaning or lawfulness of government action.\n\nThe Supreme Court, for example, acted properly in disregarding President Barack Obama\u2019s statement that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate was \u201cabsolutely not a tax increase.\u201d When the case came before the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia did press the federal government\u2019s lawyer to explain the president\u2019s remarks. But in the end, none of the opinions in the case even mentioned the remarks, presumably because the court concluded they were irrelevant to the constitutional question of Congress\u2019s power to regulate health care. Most presidential speech isn\u2019t legally significant.\n\nAgain, there are important exceptions. The Supreme Court has long held that in the context of religious discrimination claims, proof of government purpose is required to establish a constitutional violation. And countless courts have relied on statements by government officials in such cases. In 1993, in a case concerning whether a city ordinance in Florida impeded the free exercise of religion, the Supreme Court held that government purpose could be gleaned from \u201ccontemporaneous statements made by members of the decision-making body.\u201d\n\nGiving decisive weight to all presidential statements would be a bad idea. It would unduly empower the president, allowing him to circumvent internal executive-branch processes, and it would also unduly disempower him, preventing him from speaking freely about topics that might have litigation consequences. Each effect would be problematic, whether we\u2019re talking about President Trump or any other president.\n\nIn the case of the travel ban, however, given the relevance of Mr. Trump\u2019s words to determining its purpose, the courts can rule that the president\u2019s speech is germane in this particular instance \u2014 without opening Pandora\u2019s box.", "authors": ["Kate Shaw"], "publish_date": "2017-05-31", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["matter", "travel", "case", "courts", "purpose", "supreme", "speech", "court", "statements", "words", "sign", "president", "presidents"], "summary": "Privileging such documents ensures that the careful processes and expertise they reflect are not overshadowed by casual presidential utterances or ill-considered tweets.\nThe judges who have objected to using Mr. Trump\u2019s words against him in the travel ban litigation have been motivated by such concerns.\nThe Supreme Court, for example, acted properly in disregarding President Barack Obama\u2019s statement that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate was \u201cabsolutely not a tax increase.\u201d When the case came before the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia did press the federal government\u2019s lawyer to explain the president\u2019s remarks.\nThe Supreme Court has long held that in the context of religious discrimination claims, proof of government purpose is required to establish a constitutional violation.\nIn the case of the travel ban, however, given the relevance of Mr. Trump\u2019s words to determining its purpose, the courts can rule that the president\u2019s speech is germane in this particular instance \u2014 without opening Pandora\u2019s box."}
