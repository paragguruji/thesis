An airport greeter tried to reassure him around 9 p.m., saying it could sometimes take more than two hours for a passenger to pass through customs. Two hours later, with no sign of his younger brother, Mr. Vayghan was distraught.\n\nMr. Vayghan, his wife and his daughter had not heard any news about the executive order \u2014 they thought that perhaps Mr. Vayeghan was being targeted for a crime he did not commit.\n\nMr. Vayghan asked a man he saw helping passengers with their wheelchairs for help: Could he look for Mr. Vayeghan? He offered a brief description of his brother \u2014 \u201cskinny, not too tall and not very dark or very white, like me\u201d \u2014 and handed him his business card. A minute later, the man returned, saying the only people he had seen were returning from Latin America. Then Mr. Vayghan\u2019s phone rang, with a federal agent on the other end.\n\n\u201cSorry, sir, I have bad news,\u201d Mr. Vayghan recalled the agent saying. \u201cIn my culture, we only say bad news when it means somebody is dead.\u201d\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\n\nThe agent told him he could not talk to his brother but said he would call again on Saturday morning. Still confused and scared, Mr. Vayghan returned to his home in west Los Angeles.\n\nBy the time he came back to the airport on Saturday, protesters were beginning to gather, and lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations had set up shop in the international terminal. After hearing about Mr. Vayeghan, the lawyers quickly filed a case arguing that the order violated due process and the First Amendment because it was hostile to Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe brothers communicated occasionally by phone and text, and Mr. Vayeghan said he had not been given any food to eat or a place to sleep. Federal officers were pressuring him to a sign a document withdrawing his green card, he said, telling him he could be permanently banned from the United States if he did not. After hours of refusal, Mr. Vayeghan gave in, unsure of what exactly he was signing. Soon after, the authorities tried to get him to board a plane to Dubai, but Mr. Vayeghan hesitated. The agents soon picked him up to force him onto the plane, he later told his family.\n\nOfficials from Customs and Border Protection, which carried out the order at airports across the country, did not return calls for comment.\n\nWhen Mr. Vayeghan arrived in Dubai, the officers who escorted him off the plane took his passport and pushed him several times, he told his brother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. If somebody is criminal, they don\u2019t treat them this way,\u201d Mr. Vayghan said. \u201cAll of us, we have a good name. We have done nothing wrong in our whole life. In generations, we have had no problems.\u201d\n\nAfter the court ruled in Mr. Vayeghan\u2019s favor on Sunday, the lawyers rushed to alert the authorities in Dubai, but it was too late.\n\nIf he had been on a later flight or if the order had come more quickly, Mr. Vayeghan might have been back in Los Angeles by now.\n\n\u201cWhat he went through is not this country,\u201d said his niece Marjan Vayghan, who came to California with her parents when she was 6. \u201cThat is like a madness. That is not the right L.A. that I know at all.\u201d\n\nPeter Bibring, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U. of Southern California who is representing Mr. Vayeghan, said the ruling showed that scores of removals this weekend were unfair and illegal.\n\n\u201cThis was a case for one person, but people across the country suffered similar treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt demonstrates that the valid visa holders who were removed this weekend should be returned.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Vayghan and her father are urging Mr. Vayeghan to come back and stay in the United States, living here with his status as a legal permanent resident. Now in Tehran, he is reluctant to board another plane. He worries what will happen if he returns, Ms. Vayghan said. If this could happen, he told her, what else might be possible?", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Jennifer Medina", "type": "article"}
