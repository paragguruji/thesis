Bannon, the chief White House strategist, oversaw the writing of the order, which was done by a small White House team, including Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy chief. But it was first imagined more than a year ago, when Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican nomination, reacted to terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., by calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tried to back away from the proposal, which was seen by Democrats as over-the-top campaign rhetoric that would never be reality. Mr. Trump offered few details as the campaign progressed, and as president-elect he promised to protect the country from terrorists with only vague promises of \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Bannon, who believes in highly restrictive immigration policies and saw barring refugees as vital to shoring up Mr. Trump\u2019s political base, was determined to make it happen. He and a small group made up of the president\u2019s closest advisers began working on the order during the transition so that Mr. Trump could sign it soon after taking office.\n\nA senior administration official said that the order was drafted in cooperation with some immigration experts on Capitol Hill and members of the \u201cbeachhead teams\u201d \u2014 small groups of political appointees sent by the new White House to be liaisons and begin work at the agencies.\n\nJames Jay Carafano, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said that little of that work was shared with career officials at the Homeland Security Department, the State Department or other agencies.\n\nThere was \u201ca firewall between the old administration and the incoming one,\u201d Mr. Carafano said.\n\nOne reason, he said, is that when the Trump transition team asked pointed questions suggesting new policies to the career officials, those questions were swiftly leaked to the news media, generating negative stories. So the Trump team began to limit the information they discussed with officials from the previous administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhy share it with them?\u201d Mr. Carafano said.\n\nR. Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama, said that his staff had little communication with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, who made no mention of a bar on entry for people from certain countries.\n\nWhite House officials in the meantime insisted to reporters at a briefing that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had been in contact with officials at the State and Homeland Security Departments for \u201cmany weeks.\u201d\n\nOne official added, \u201cEveryone who needed to know was informed.\u201d\n\nBut that apparently did not include members of the president\u2019s own cabinet.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Last summer, Mr. Mattis sharply criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration as a move that was \u201ccausing us great damage right now, and it\u2019s sending shock waves through the international system.\u201d\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officers were also caught unaware.\n\nThey contacted several airlines late Friday that were likely to be carrying passengers from the seven countries and \u201cinstructed the airlines to offload any passport holders from those countries,\u201d said a state government official who has been briefed on the agency\u2019s actions.\n\nIt was not until 3 a.m. on Saturday that customs and border officials received limited written instructions about what to do at airports and border crossings. They also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order, which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case.\n\nOne customs officer, who declined to be quoted by name, said he was given a limited briefing about what to do as he went to his post on Saturday morning, but even managers seemed unclear. People at the agency were blindsided, he said, and are still trying to figure things out, even as people are being stopped from coming into the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the secretary doesn\u2019t know anything, how could we possibly know anything at this level?\u201d the officer said, referring to Mr. Kelly.\n\nAt the Citizenship and Immigration Service, staff members were told that the agency should stop work on any application filed by a person from any of the countries listed in the ban. Employees were told that applicants should be interviewed, but that their cases for citizenship, green cards or other immigration documents should be put on pause, pending further guidance.\n\nThe timing of the executive order and the lack of advance warning had homeland security officials \u201cflying by the seat of their pants,\u201d to try to put policies in place, one official said.\n\nBy Saturday, as the order stranded travelers around the world and its full impact became clear, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, became increasingly upset about how the program had been rolled out and communicated to the public.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Mr. Priebus had to defend the immigration ban on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where he insisted that the executive order was rolled out smoothly. He also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order\u2019s restrictions on entry to the United States would not apply to legal permanent residents \u201cgoing forward.\u201d\n\nAs White House officials also insisted on Sunday that the order had gone through the usual process of scrutiny and approval by the Office of Legal Counsel, the continuing confusion forced Mr. Kelly to clarify the waiver situation. He issued a statement making clear that lawful permanent residents \u2014 those who hold valid green cards \u2014 would be granted a waiver to enter the United States unless information suggested that they were a security threat.\n\nBut senior White House officials insisted on Sunday night that the executive order would remain in force despite the change, and that they were proud of taking actions that they said would help protect Americans against threats from potential terrorists.\n\nThat assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor, which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s second full week in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Carafano said he believed that the substance of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was neither radical nor unreasonable. But he said that Mr. Trump\u2019s team could have delayed signing the order until they had better prepared the bureaucracy to carry it out.\n\nHe also said the president and his team had not done a good job of communicating to the public the purpose of the executive order.\n\n\u201cIf there is a criticism of the administration, and I think there is, I think they have done a rotten job of telling their story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not like they did not know they were going to do this. To not have a cadre of people out there defending the administration \u2014 I mean, really guys, they should have done this.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael D.
