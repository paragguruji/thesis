Yates, the acting attorney general and a holdover from Mr. Obama\u2019s team, said she would not defend the immigration order in court. And it followed a weekend during which former top Obama administration officials put aside plans to unplug from the day-to-day policy debates that consume Washington to recharge after a whirlwind final few months in power, and instead joined protests in the streets or spoke out against Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

She also signed a letter from more than 100 former national security officials, many but not all of them Democrats, to the Trump administration expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the ban.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s statement and the articles and letters from his former top advisers were a break with past custom. Outgoing presidents and their staffs usually grant an informal grace period of sorts to a new administration, staying quiet publicly about policy differences.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

I put in that category, if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama was still on vacation with his wife in Palm Springs, Calif., on Monday and was not available for an interview, Mr. Lewis said. But after a weekend of watching chaos at airports as green card holders and many others were detained, aides said the former president felt it was vital to express his views.\n\nMr. Obama was also determined, they added, to push back against the argument \u2014 made by Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers as they defended the order \u2014 that it had been Mr. Obama\u2019s idea to bar entrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s comments came with a reminder that he had in the past spoken out against the kind of tactics Mr. Trump employed on Friday, when he ordered a temporary halt to admitting people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan or Yemen and a freeze on the United States refugee program, which he said should give priority to Christians in the future.\n\nAlong with Mr. Obama\u2019s statement, Mr. Lewis appended a section of remarks the former president delivered in November 2015 at a summit in Antalya, Turkey, when he spoke out against a Muslim ban that Mr. Trump, then a candidate for president, had proposed.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution \u2014 that\u2019s shameful,\u201d Mr. Obama said then. \u201cThat\u2019s not American. That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his aides have contended that the immigration order is not a Muslim ban because it does not affect several predominantly Muslim countries. They have also argued that it is similar to actions Mr. Obama took, including a six-month ban on refugees from Iraq he instituted in 2011, and a requirement his administration added in 2015 that travelers from the same seven countries have visas for entering the United States.\n\nBut the 2011 action, which only affected one country, was in response to specific threat information about Iraqis seeking to use the refugee program to enter the United States and carry out terrorist acts. And while it tightened visa requirements for people entering from the seven countries, the Obama administration never sought to bar them.", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "type": "article"}
