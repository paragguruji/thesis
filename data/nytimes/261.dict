Purcell, Washington\u2019s solicitor general, wrote.\n\nAt a hearing on Monday afternoon in Seattle, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, urged Judge Robart to halt proceedings in the trial court.\n\nJudge Robart said he was surprised to hear her make that argument, in light of a statement from Mr. Trump after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling. \u201c\u2018See you in court,\u2019\u201d Judge Robart said, quoting a Twitter post by Mr. Trump, which drew a laugh in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to slow this down,\u201d Judge Robart said. \u201cThere is a very sensitive time issue.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also suspended travel from seven Muslim-majority nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 for 90 days.\n\nOn Thursday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to stay Judge Robart\u2019s order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. Those briefs are due Thursday.\n\nIf a majority of the court\u2019s active judges voted to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an 11-member panel made up of the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random.\n\nRehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by three-judge panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges, 18 of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nIn a separate order, the three-judge panel last Thursday set a schedule for submitting briefs in the underlying appeal. (The question decided on Thursday was whether to stay the trial court order. The question at issue in the new briefs is whether that ruling was correct.) The last of those briefs is due March 29.\n\nJudge Robart, meanwhile, was considering on Monday what should happen in his court in the meantime.\n\nLast Friday, he asked the states and the Justice Department to file briefs on whether there was a need for further proceedings in his court. Ordinarily, after a temporary restraining order is issued, the parties would file additional briefs and perhaps submit evidence on whether to make the order more permanent by entering a preliminary injunction.\n\nBefore the Ninth Circuit ruled, Judge Robart ordered the parties to file those briefs starting on Feb. 9 and ending on Feb. 17.\n\nBut the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling complicated matters by treating the order as a preliminary injunction, suggesting that there was nothing more for Judge Robart to do for now.\n\nMr. Purcell said that was the right interpretation of the appeals court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cIn short, because the Ninth Circuit has construed the Feb. 3 order to grant all the preliminary relief the states would have sought through a motion for a preliminary injunction, no additional briefing or evidence is required in the district court on the propriety of preliminary relief,\u201d Mr. Purcell wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department, in a brief signed by Ms. Bennett, did not take a firm position on that question, saying only that \u201cfurther proceedings in the Ninth Circuit will likely inform whether additional proceedings on a preliminary injunction motion are necessary in the district court.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
