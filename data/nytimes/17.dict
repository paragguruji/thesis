But this is nonsense. Immigrants cannot legally be issued a visa if they are barred from entry. Thus, all orders under the 1952 law apply equally to entry and visa issuance, as his executive order acknowledges.\n\nNote that the discrimination ban applies only to immigrants. Legally speaking, immigrants are those who are given permanent United States residency. By contrast, temporary visitors like guest workers, students and tourists, as well as refugees, could still be barred. The 1965 law does not ban discrimination based on religion \u2014 which was Mr. Trump\u2019s original proposal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In the most commonly cited case, President Jimmy Carter barred certain Iranians during the 1980 hostage crisis, but the targets were mainly students, tourists and temporary visitors. Even then, the policy had many humanitarian exceptions. Immigrants continued to be admitted in 1980.\n\nWhile courts rarely interfere in immigration matters, they have affirmed the discrimination ban. In the 1990s, for example, the government created a policy that required Vietnamese who had fled to Hong Kong to return to Vietnam if they wanted to apply for United States immigrant visas, while it allowed applicants from other countries to apply for visas wherever they wanted. A federal appeals court blocked the policy.\n\nThe government in that case did not even bother arguing that the 1952 law permitted discrimination. The court rejected its defense that a \u201crational link\u201d with a temporary foreign policy measure could justify ignoring the law \u2014 an argument the Trump administration is sure to make. The court wrote, \u201cWe cannot rewrite a statutory provision which by its own terms provides no exceptions or qualifications.\u201d\n\nTo resolve this case, Congress amended the law in 1996 to state that \u201cprocedures\u201d and \u201clocations\u201d for processing immigration applications cannot count as discrimination. While there is plenty of room for executive mischief there, the amendment made clear that Congress still wanted the discrimination ban to hold some force. A blanket immigration prohibition on a nationality by the president would still be illegal.\n\nEven if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far. If Mr. Trump can legally ban an entire region of the world, he would render Congress\u2019s vision of unbiased legal immigration a dead letter. An appeals court stopped President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions to spare millions of undocumented immigrants from deportations for the similar reason that he was circumventing Congress. Some discretion? Sure. Discretion to rewrite the law? Not in America\u2019s constitutional system.", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "authors": "David J. Bier", "type": "article"}
