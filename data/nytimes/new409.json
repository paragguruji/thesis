That order was blocked as well, with federal appeals courts ruling that it discriminated based on religion, in violation of the First Amendment, and exceeded the president\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nThe decision Thursday by the administration to revive and aggressively enforce another version of the president\u2019s travel ban is certain to keep the intense debate about America\u2019s borders going into the Supreme Court\u2019s fall term, when the justices are scheduled to decide the legal fate of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict entry by particular groups.\n\n\n\nOfficials said they were determined to \u201cmeet the intent of the presidential directive\u201d within the boundaries set by the Supreme Court, which issued an interim opinion when it agreed to consider the issue in its next term. Administration officials said their definition of a \u201cfamily connection\u201d was based on existing immigration law and directions from the court.\n\nHours before the new guidelines went into effect Thursday evening, officials predicted little of the chaos that engulfed airports in January, when the president issued his original travel ban. This time, officials said, people already booked to travel to the United States would be allowed to enter. And they made it clear that legal permanent residents were not affected by the ban.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s newest move could prompt another wave of litigation as advocates for those trying to enter the United States ask courts to halt enforcement of the ban. Already, lawyers in Washington have asked the court to allow the entry of refugees with no \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther lawyers representing people who have been blocked from visiting the United States described the government\u2019s actions as meanspirited and said they made unreasonable distinctions about family relations.\n\n\u201cAllowing a U.S. citizen to bring their Syrian mother-in-law but not their Syrian brother-in-law doesn\u2019t make us any safer, and doesn\u2019t even really make any sense,\u201d said Gadeir Abbas, a staff lawyer at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nMr. Trump has said that his travel ban does not directly target Muslims, although the six countries on the list that the president has deemed dangerous \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 are majority Muslim.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, condemned the administration\u2019s move. \u201cU.S. now bans Iranian grandmothers from seeing their grandchildren, in a truly shameful exhibition of blind hostility to all Iranians,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFor refugees fleeing civil wars and violence around the world, the administration\u2019s action on Thursday means that a 120-day ban on entry from all countries will most likely bar many of them from finding safety in the United States.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the United States so far this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. Officials predicted that the new 50,000 cap would be reached by July 6, so refugees who are planning to travel after that date will not automatically be allowed into the country. Travel arrangements for refugees beyond July 6 will not be allowed until the State Department makes an assessment, officials said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tillerson that their clients should pass muster.\n\n\u201cThe order stated that a bona fide relationship with an entity should be \u2018formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading E.O.-2,\u2019\u201d Hans van de Weerd, chairman of the Refugee Council USA, the coordinating body for agencies that handle resettlement, wrote in the letter, referring to the president\u2019s executive order. He added that refugee agencies only accept applicants who have already proven that \u201che or she has ties to the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for refugees and others also complained on Thursday that the administration had little evidence for how the travel ban would protect citizens and others living in the United States.\n\nNo Americans have been killed by terrorist attacks on United States soil undertaken by anyone from the six targeted countries since at least 1975, according to a Cato Institute study, and at a midday news conference, top officials from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Justice would not say how the president\u2019s executive order would make the country safer.\n\nIn a briefing later in the afternoon, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, said those officials were career employees charged with carrying out the order, not defending its politics. When asked to defend the order herself, Ms. Nauert, a political appointee, was halting in her response.\n\n\u201cWith some of these countries, we would take issue certainly with the government of Iran, and some of the nations there can be concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the American public could have legitimate concerns about their safety when we open our doors. And we want to open our doors to people who are willing to go through proper screening measures and who want to be here and want to be productive members of our society.\u201d", "authors": ["Gardiner Harris", "Michael D.
