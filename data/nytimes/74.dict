Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. But since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO ally, sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood, such a step would further complicate that fraught alliance.\n\nTaken together, Mr. Trump\u2019s plans would damage America\u2019s credibility as guardian of human rights, anger allies and undermine civil liberties at home. They will also inspire fear in law-abiding Muslims everywhere, but especially those in America, whose help is crucial to identifying and pre-empting young people tempted by extremism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

During the campaign, he often lamented that America did not take possession of Iraq\u2019s oil after the 2003 invasion. On Saturday, he went further and said \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll have another chance,\u201d suggesting he may be considering another invasion to seize Iraq\u2019s oil, a violation of international law. Such a move, against an ally no less, could incite extremist attacks against the United States. Mr. Trump seemed not to realize that ISIS gets most of its oil revenue from Syria.\n\nSources of Inspiration\n\nTo understand Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking, one might look to his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, author of the book \u201cThe Field of Fight.\u201d Mr. Flynn was fired from his job as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration. He has trafficked in fake news and been part of the world of conspiracy theorists who trade in fantasies that Shariah law is being imposed on Americans.\n\nA fearful tone permeates Mr. Flynn\u2019s book, which warns, \u201cWe\u2019re in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam.\u201d For Mr. Flynn and fellow radicals, the fight isn\u2019t against a small number of religious fanatics who seek to attack the West and its Arab allies, but an entire religion.\n\nMr. Obama and former President George W. Bush generally agreed that terrorists had perverted the teachings of Islam, not that Islam was the problem. For them and most national security experts, containing terrorism meant focusing on individuals and groups that were intent on doing harm to America \u2014 namely Al Qaeda and groups like ISIS \u2014 while not turning all Muslims into the enemy.\n\nNot so Mr. Trump, who said last year, \u201cI think Islam hates us,\u201d and Mr. Flynn, who has decried Islamism as a \u201cvicious cancer.\u201d Both Mr. Flynn and Sebastian Gorka, the national security editor at the alt-right website Breitbart News, who may be considered for a position in the Trump administration as a counterterrorism adviser and wrote a book titled \u201dDefeating Jihad,\u201d characterize \u201cradical Islam\u201d to be as grave a threat as Hitler in World War II and the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his book, Mr. Flynn labels as extremist enemies a wide range of groups, including not just Sunni Muslim groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, but countless others and many countries, like North Korea, Shiite-majority Iran, China, Syria, Venezuela and Russia. Mr. Flynn seems to be advocating a shotgun approach toward a target that requires precision.\n\nMr. Flynn also hints that the battlefield could expand beyond current conflicts in the Middle East, writing that \u201cwe must engage the violent Islamists wherever they are\u201d and promising \u201csevere consequences\u201d for Saudi Arabia and other countries if they continue aiding terrorist groups. He is especially alarmed about Iran and argues that Washington \u201cshould consider how to change Iran from within.\u201d\n\nThe president has a responsibility to defend the country against extremist threats, but the ideas of Mr. Flynn and others, if adopted, seem like a recipe for endless world war. It is especially hard to see how destabilizing Iran, one of the few intact countries in the Middle East, would advance American interests at a time the region is in chaos.\n\nThe United States undoubtedly must find more effective ways to defeat terrorists, including by undermining their message. If Mr. Trump can do that, it will be to his credit. But to a great extent success will depend on long-term cooperation from Muslim leaders and allies.", "publish_date": "2017-01-26", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
