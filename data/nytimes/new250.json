So had Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a senior adviser. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who is closely aligned with friends of Mr. Abrams\u2019, and some members of the pro-Israel lobbying group Aipac, had been reaching out to Democratic senators to impress upon them the importance of Mr. Abrams receiving Senate confirmation.\n\nAides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nDemocrats turn up heat on Flynn\n\nThe revelation that Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, apparently discussed sanctions with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States in the weeks before the inauguration has given Democrats a new cudgel to revive discussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nAnd they are swinging it.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell of California, the ranking Democrat on the C.I.A. subcommittee of the House Intelligence Committee, called it \u201ca crime for someone outside of our government to negotiate with foreign entities on our nation\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nSenators Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, were similarly scathing in a joint statement. Said Mr. Murphy:\n\n\u201cThere is no good way to explain today\u2019s report that Michael Flynn was coordinating sanctions relief for Russia before his boss was inaugurated. Either Donald Trump directed his National Security Adviser to undermine U.S. foreign policy on Russia, or Michael Flynn went rogue and did it on his own. Then he either lied to the Vice President or the Vice President went on television to lie to the American people. Whatever transpired, the President needs to get his White House under control.\u201d\n\nCandidate for solicitor general drops out\n\nWith the legal fight over President Trump\u2019s travel ban apparently headed for the Supreme Court, a leading contender for the job of arguing the government\u2019s cases before the highest court has dropped out of consideration.\n\nThe candidate, Charles J. Cooper, said he was withdrawing as a possible nominee for solicitor general of the United States \u201cafter witnessing the treatment of my friend Jeff Sessions,\u201d who was approved as attorney general Wednesday evening after bruising attacks by Senate Democrats over his civil rights record.\n\nMr. Cooper, a conservative Washington lawyer who argued against gay marriage in an important California case, said that after what Mr. Sessions \u201chad to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis withdrawal appears to leave George T. Conway, a New York lawyer who is married to Kellyanne Conway, a top White House aide, as the leading contender for solicitor general. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he expected to select a new nominee in about a week. Whoever gets confirmed for the job could end up arguing the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u2018Big, beautiful\u2019 \u2014 and pricey\n\nNo wonder Mr. Trump wants the Mexicans to pay for it.\n\nThe wall on the southern border \u2014 really a set of fences and walls \u2014 would take three and a half years to build and would cost $21.6 billion, according to an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security that was seen by Reuters.\n\nThat\u2019s well over the $12 billion estimated by Mr. Trump during the campaign, and the upper bound of $15 billion cited by Republican leaders in Congress.\n\nAt a time when federal deficits are again expected to grow, the amount is not pocket change. As the population ages and draws on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office is already expecting the government to heap nearly $10 trillion onto the federal debt over the coming decade \u2014 and that is with statutory caps on domestic and military spending. Mr. Trump has already vowed to bust through those caps on the military side of the ledger, something that would take an act of Congress.\n\nNow he\u2019ll have to pay extra for his promised wall \u2014 either out of existing domestic programs or above the nondefense caps.\n\nPresidential viewing habits ... exposed\n\nMr. Trump is still pretty miffed that a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a restraining order against his travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nWe can also deduce what he was watching on television: MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\nWonder why it took 12 minutes to compose that post on Twitter.\n\nThat sudden talk with China\n\nOn Thursday night, The New York Times published a scoop: the president of the United States had not spoken to the president of China, Xi Jinping, who was icing him out over his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan during his transition to power, and his suggestion that just maybe, Washington would no longer follow the \u201cOne China\u201d policy (which affirms that Taiwan is a province of the mainland).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHours later, the White House issued a statement that, hey, not only had Mr. Trump just spoken to Mr. Xi, he had also expressed support for the One China policy after all \u2014 something Mr. Trump had said he would do only in return for concessions.\n\nThe Times story was rewritten accordingly, capturing the news.\n\nBut Mr. Trump does not accept the chronology \u2014 at least not publicly.\n\nThe campaign never ends\n\nHillary Clinton has been slow to emerge after her November defeat. But there she was on social media Thursday night, praising the unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a nationwide restraining order against Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban for seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nTo which Kellyanne Conway, the Trump campaign-manager-turned-White House adviser, had a reply.\n\nWinning is everything.\n\nHouse Republicans face a backlash\n\nFirst came the video of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado sneaking out a back door to avoid the angry crowd gathered for his town hall meeting \u2014 but his suburban Denver district is swingy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But hey, it\u2019s California \u2014 even though his turf outside Sacramento isn\u2019t exactly Berkeley.\n\nBut Utah? On Wednesday, it was Representative Jason Chaffetz\u2019s turn \u2014 in the reddest of states, in the Salt Lake City suburb Cottonwood Heights.\n\nIt\u2019s getting ugly out there.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Jonathan Weisman", "Eric Lichtblau"], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["elliott", "travel", "trump", "state", "security", "overrules", "secretary", "trumps", "york", "general", "abrams", "rejecting", "states", "president", "house", "mr", "tillerson", "deputy"], "summary": "Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.\nMr. Trump said Thursday that he expected to select a new nominee in about a week.\nWhoever gets confirmed for the job could end up arguing the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban before the Supreme Court.\n\u2018Big, beautiful\u2019 \u2014 and priceyNo wonder Mr. Trump wants the Mexicans to pay for it.\nMr. Trump has already vowed to bust through those caps on the military side of the ledger, something that would take an act of Congress."}
