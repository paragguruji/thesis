To see this, look beyond Mr. Turnbull\u2019s silence to his senior colleagues. Like Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who said, \u201cThe Australian government and the U.S. government will continue to support each other in ensuring that we can implement our strong immigration and border protection policies.\u201d Or Scott Morrison, the treasurer, who said, our country is \u201cthe envy of the world when it comes to strong border protection policies.\u201d\n\nThis is more than a refusal to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s selective ban on people from some Muslim-majority nations. It\u2019s an effort to claim credit for Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, as if Australia is an inspiration. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement was cast as America\u2019s attempt to emulate Australia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But the idea that this stretches so far as to evoke Australian pride in what Mr. Trump unleashed is new, and dangerous.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous because Australia fully renounced its discriminatory White Australia immigration policy only in 1973. Since then, nondiscrimination has been a cornerstone of Australia\u2019s social evolution, something both major parties have proudly regarded as nonnegotiable.\n\nWhen John Howard as opposition leader suggested in 1988 that Australia should consider merely slowing the rate of Asian immigration, he lost his job and, many thought, his political career. It took him until 1995 to reattain his leadership role. Yet today, Mr. Howard\u2019s remarks seem mild.\n\nBut it\u2019s also dangerous because of the moment we\u2019re in. Mr. Trump\u2019s gravitational pull is visible in the resurgence of the far-right, nationalist One Nation Party, which wants not only to ban Muslim immigration, but also to convene a commission to determine if Islam is a religion or political movement.\n\nNaturally, Pauline Hanson, the One Nation Party leader, tweeted that Mr. Trump\u2019s policy was \u201ca good start, but I would go further.\u201d The Turnbull government has members of its own backbench who share similar sentiments. One explicitly declared, \u201cI think Trump has got it right.\u201d Another \u2014 who met with Rudolph Giuliani and Kellyanne Conway during the campaign and wants to \u201cmake Australia great again\u201d \u2014 has established his own breakaway party. And while it is true these views are on the fringes of our Parliament, they are not entirely relegated to the margins of public opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAustralia is now a nation where, according to an opinion poll from last year, 49 percent support a ban on Muslim immigration, a result so shocking the pollsters did it twice before releasing it. A similar poll the previous year had that figure at 28 percent. Even allowing for the vagaries of polling data, those results signal a remarkable change in a short period. In the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban, another poll found 44 percent of Australians supporting similar measures.\n\nAustralia\u2019s asylum-seeker policies were meant to prevent all this. The pious calculation is that by making a show of our iron borders, Australian multiculturalism can be protected. Shunting asylum seekers offshore bolsters public confidence in our migration system, which preserves our tolerance of the migrants who are here. Yet for all that, it now seems Australian attitudes are getting harsher.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s true that, absent our current policies, those attitudes would be worse still. But it may also be true that when you spend 15 or so years deriding asylum seekers as \u201cillegals\u201d or \u201cqueue jumpers,\u201d describing their arrival as a \u201cpeaceful invasion\u201d or warning they might be terrorists, it all lodges in the public imagination. Perhaps, far from leading to a more thorough acceptance of migration, this constant demonization of migrants establishes a norm of selective xenophobia where exempting a group of migrants from our tolerance is unremarkable.\n\nI understand the difficulty of Mr. Turnbull\u2019s position. But the reaction here to Mr. Trump represents the resurgence of our worst instincts. We\u2019re doomed if, in the face of this flirtation, the best we can muster is silence.", "publish_date": "2017-02-21", "authors": "Waleed Aly", "type": "article"}
