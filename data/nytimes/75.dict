{"title": "Texas Muslims Voice Concerns After Inflammatory Survey and Forum", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/texas-muslim-community.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cHis treatment of Muslims is giving fuel to the fire of Islamophobia that is running rampant in our state,\u201d said Sarwat Husain, founding president of the San Antonio chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a national board member of the group. Speaking at a multifaith news conference at the State Capitol at the same time Mr. Biedermann was conducting his hearing two floors below, Ms. Husain said the letter was reminiscent of McCarthyism, calling it \u201cvery misleading, humiliating, intimidating, disgusting and downright offensive.\u201d\n\nThe survey, and the meeting on Thursday, were aimed at sounding out Texas Muslims about their views, Mr. Biedermann said. But Muslims interviewed on Thursday said they were offended by the poll and did not return it.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne question asked if the respondent would support a pledge for religious freedom and safety from harm for former Muslims. Another asked if the Muslim Brotherhood should be declared a terrorist organization. The survey also asked if the respondent supported the Muslim Reform Movement, which espouses opposition to \u201cviolent jihad\u201d or \u201cviolent Islamic extremism.\u201d\n\nBee Moorhead, executive director of Texas Impact, a statewide religious advocacy network that includes Christians, Jews and Muslims, said the group sent a letter to mosques and Muslim organizations urging them to disregard the survey. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it is that an elected official in a position of power sent out that letter in a way that would have made someone think the survey was an official piece of business of the State of Texas,\u201d Ms. Moorhead said in an interview. \u201cIt was an intimidating and misleading piece of communication on the part of a public servant.\u201d\n\nMr. Biedermann, who was sworn in when the Legislature convened on Jan. 10, said the House leadership approved his use of a committee chamber to conduct his hearing, but the House speaker, Joe Straus, signaled his disapproval. \u201cI believe it is wrong and offensive to single out any group based on their religion,\u201d Mr. Straus, a San Antonio Republican, said in a statement released by his office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As a Texas senator in 2007, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick boycotted the first Muslim prayer delivered in the Texas Senate, saying he did not want his presence in the chamber to \u201cappear that I was endorsing that.\u201d Armed protesters have also appeared outside mosques in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nIn 2015, State Representative Molly White, a Republican from Belton in central Texas, ignited a firestorm by demanding that Muslims in town for that year\u2019s Muslim Day publicly declare their allegiance to the United States before entering her office.\n\nMr. Biedermann said his efforts were designed to increase public awareness about what he called an expanding threat in the form of Islamic terrorism that, he said, is spreading into the United States from across the southern border. In opening his hearing, he said that many crossing the border illegally came from countries with ties to terrorism, such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cWith the rise of radical Islamic terrorism at home and throughout the world, homeland security must be our top priority,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview afterward, Mr. Biedermann said border security and the threat of terrorism were cited as the \u201cNo. 1 issue\u201d by thousands of voters in his district when he was campaigning for the legislative seat, which he won in a runoff. He says his office is open to \u201cTexans of all backgrounds and religions.\u201d\n\nMustafa Tameez, a Muslim who was a consultant to the Department of Homeland Security in the Bush administration, said the survey was \u201ca roundabout way of trying to get people to sign some kind of loyalty pledge, and that\u2019s not where the threat is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that are the real threat are individuals who have self-radicalized or radicalized over the internet,\u201d Mr. Tameez said.", "publish_date": "2017-01-26", "authors": "David Montgomery and Manny Fernandez", "type": "article"}
