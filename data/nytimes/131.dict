At the same time, President Trump downgraded two senior national security officials \u2014 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a role now held by Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., and the director of national intelligence, the job that Dan Coats, a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and former ambassador to Germany, has been nominated to fill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In giving Mr. Bannon an official role in national security policy making, Mr. Trump has not simply broken with tradition but has embraced the risk of politicizing national security, or giving the impression of doing so.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order says that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the director of national intelligence will attend the principals\u2019 committee meetings only \u201cwhere issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\u201d Could there be any national security discussions when input from the intelligence agencies and the military will not be required? People in those jobs are often the ones to tell presidents hard truths, even when they are unwelcome.\n\nAs his first week in office amply demonstrated, Mr. Trump has no grounding in national security decision making, no sophistication in governance and little apparent grasp of what it takes to lead a great diverse nation. He needs to hear from experienced officials, like General Dunford. But Mr. Bannon has positioned himself, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as the president\u2019s most trusted aide, shutting out other voices that might offer alternative views. He is now reportedly eclipsing the national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump long ago embraced Mr. Bannon\u2019s politics, he would be wise to reconsider allowing him to run his White House, particularly after the fiasco over the weekend of the risible Muslim ban. Mr. Bannon helped push that order through without consulting Mr. Trump\u2019s own experts at the Department of Homeland Security or even seeking deliberation by the N.S.C. itself. The administration\u2019s subsequent modifications, the courtroom reversals and the international furor have made the president look not bold and decisive but simply incompetent.\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump was immensely gratified by the applause at his rallies for Mr. Bannon\u2019s jingoism. Yet now casually weaponized in executive orders, those same ideas are alienating American allies and damaging the presidency.\n\nPresidents are entitled to pick their advisers. But Mr. Trump\u2019s first spasms of policy making have supplied ample evidence that he needs advisers who can think strategically and weigh second- and third-order consequences beyond the immediate domestic political effects. Imagine tomorrow if Mr. Trump is faced with a crisis involving China in the South China Sea or Russia in Ukraine. Will he look to his chief political provocateur, Mr. Bannon, with his penchant for blowing things up, or will he turn at last for counsel to the few more thoughtful experienced hands in his administration, like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and General Dunford?", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
