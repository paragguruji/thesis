I am not a cardiologist. I judge him like I do the rest of humanity \u2014 by his consistent rhetoric and actions.\n\nSo here we are. The future of the country\u2019s soul will be fought along the lines of race, class, gender and Islam. Will we accept Muslims, the most diverse religious communities in America, as an integral part of our fabric, or allow them to be discarded as an inconvenient thread in an internment camp?\n\nA day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, a few friends gathered in Virginia for a house party we called \u201cCome Visit Sanctuary City,\u201d as a chance to heal and overeat Hyderabadi food. Many of these peers, all hard-working, educated children of Muslim immigrants, had made a surprising decision: It was time to have guns in their homes to protect their families. Their only previous shooting experience, like mine, is limited to the Nintendo Zapper we used in Duck Hunt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Having co-produced two babies already, I\u2019ve already done my part in populating the recruits.\n\nBut according to a recent poll, we need not worry because people believe there are already 54 million Muslims in America. Alternative fact-check: There are only three million. We are not Gremlins who multiply if you feed us hummus after midnight. But hate and paranoia create imaginary enemies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe days look bleak right now, but I refuse to give into cynicism, nihilism or hate. My faith commands me to remain hopeful. There\u2019s a beautiful saying of the Prophet Muhammad: \u201cEven if you see the day of judgment coming around the corner, plant a seed.\u201d\n\nEven though the cruelty of the earliest days of President Trump\u2019s administration seems like the horsemen signaling the end of times, the crisis has also awakened a multicultural coalition in America determined to resist.\n\nResistance means arming yourself with ferocity and compassion, leaving the comfort of your homes to go plant a seed at a local airport. Resistance means joining Yemenis in the New York City streets who closed their bodegas to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban. Resistance is people donating millions to the American Civil Liberties Union so it can defend the Constitution\u2019s being manipulated like Play-Doh to advance hate.\n\nResistance for me is owning my multi-hyphenated identity with humble swagger and calling President Trump \u201cBannon\u2019s Poodle\u201d on cable television. Resistance is forgiving my high school acquaintance who apologized on my Facebook page for not taking Mr. Trump seriously and vowing to stand in solidarity with us. Resistance is the Arabic names and caramel-mocha brown faces of my children, smiling in the age of carnage.\n\nI will refuse to teach my children that their legacy as American Muslims will be the following: You suffer well. You will always be a victim. You will always be hated, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nI\u2019ll teach them instead to hope, love, forgive and fight back when necessary. That\u2019s what resistance looks like.", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": "Wajahat Ali", "type": "article"}
