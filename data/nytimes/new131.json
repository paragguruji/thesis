But we\u2019ve never witnessed a political aide move as brazenly to consolidate power as Stephen Bannon \u2014 nor have we seen one do quite so much damage so quickly to his putative boss\u2019s popular standing or pretenses of competence.\n\nMr. Bannon supercharged Breitbart News as a platform for inciting the alt-right, did the same with the Trump campaign and is now repeating the act with the Trump White House itself. That was perhaps to be expected, though the speed with which President Trump has moved to alienate Mexicans (by declaring they would pay for a border wall), Jews (by disregarding their unique experience of the Holocaust) and Muslims (the ban) has been impressive. Mr. Trump never showed much inclination to reach beyond the minority base of voters that delivered his Electoral College victory, and Mr. Bannon, whose fingerprints were on each of those initiatives, is helping make sure he doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut a new executive order, politicizing the process for national security decisions, suggests Mr. Bannon is positioning himself not merely as a Svengali but as the de facto president.\n\nIn that new order, issued on Saturday, Mr. Trump took the unprecedented step of naming Mr. Bannon to the National Security Council, along with the secretaries of state and defense and certain other top officials. President George W. Bush\u2019s last chief of staff, Joshua Bolten, was so concerned about separating politics from national security that he barred Mr. Rove, Mr. Bush\u2019s political adviser, from N.S.C. meetings. To the annoyance of experienced foreign policy aides, David Axelrod, President Barack Obama\u2019s political adviser, sat in on some N.S.C. meetings, but he was not a permanent member of the council.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore telling still, Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Bannon to the N.S.C. \u201cprincipals\u2019 committee,\u201d which includes most of those same top officials and meets far more frequently. At the same time, President Trump downgraded two senior national security officials \u2014 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a role now held by Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., and the director of national intelligence, the job that Dan Coats, a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and former ambassador to Germany, has been nominated to fill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In giving Mr. Bannon an official role in national security policy making, Mr. Trump has not simply broken with tradition but has embraced the risk of politicizing national security, or giving the impression of doing so.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["trump", "national", "bannon", "political", "security", "policy", "officials", "times", "sign", "president", "york", "mr"], "summary": "Mr. Trump never showed much inclination to reach beyond the minority base of voters that delivered his Electoral College victory, and Mr. Bannon, whose fingerprints were on each of those initiatives, is helping make sure he doesn\u2019t.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyMore telling still, Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Bannon to the N.S.C.\nSign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nIn giving Mr. Bannon an official role in national security policy making, Mr. Trump has not simply broken with tradition but has embraced the risk of politicizing national security, or giving the impression of doing so."}
