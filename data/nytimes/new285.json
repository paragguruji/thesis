He said the annual number of foreign visitors to the United States could fall by 6.3 million between 2016 and 2018 because of reactions to Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions, such as pledges to pull out of international trade agreements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a very challenging year for U.S. travel,\u201d Mr. Sacks said.\n\nHe said indicators of interest in visiting the United States, including online searches for airline tickets and hotels, started dropping after the election. They dipped again after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and fell further after he signed an executive order on the travel ban, Mr. Sacks said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe data are all showing a pretty dramatic shift in behavior and interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly accelerated since the executive order.\u201d\n\nMr. Sacks said his firm had a \u201csolid track record\u201d of forecasting tourism, but he added that there was less certainty in estimating what he called \u201cTrump impacts.\u201d\n\nForwardKeys, a Spanish company that tracks travel, said that it saw an \u201cimmediate slump\u201d in bookings of flights to the United States after the travel ban was announced, including a 13.6 percent drop in Western Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019ll keep reminding visitors what we stand for, so we can keep this both the most internationally visited and the safest city in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew York still expects a slight increase in tourism this year, but only because of an increase in domestic visitors, Mr. Dixon said. NYC & Company forecasts that the city will attract 61.7 million visitors, up from 60.7 million in 2016, with an increase of 1.3 million domestic visitors offsetting the decline of foreign travelers.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the city had been expecting an increase of 400,000 foreign visitors in 2017, Mr. Dixon said. That swing will be very costly to the city\u2019s economy, he said, because foreign tourists stay longer and spend more freely than domestic tourists. On average, foreigners spend about $2,000 in the city, compared with about $500 for Americans.\n\n\u201cWe were looking forward to a really strong 2017,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cTravel is a very precious commodity and people have choices. Once the vacation of 2017 is gone, you don\u2019t get that back.\u201d", "authors": ["Patrick Mcgeehan"], "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "foreign", "mr", "trump", "visitors", "blame", "expects", "fewer", "sacks", "united", "city", "saying", "states", "york", "tourism", "tourists"], "summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a very challenging year for U.S. travel,\u201d Mr. Sacks said.\nHe said indicators of interest in visiting the United States, including online searches for airline tickets and hotels, started dropping after the election.\nThey dipped again after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and fell further after he signed an executive order on the travel ban, Mr. Sacks said.\nBefore Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the city had been expecting an increase of 400,000 foreign visitors in 2017, Mr. Dixon said.\nThat swing will be very costly to the city\u2019s economy, he said, because foreign tourists stay longer and spend more freely than domestic tourists."}
