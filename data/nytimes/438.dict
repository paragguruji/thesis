Paradoxically, even in its refusal to be replaced, the \u201cwe\u201d depends rhetorically and constitutively upon both an opposition to \u201cyou\u201d and an address to \u201cyou\u201d in order to assert itself.\n\nNotably, these neatly dressed angry white men did not chant, in the third-person, \u201cThey will not replace us.\u201d (Granted, \u201cthey\u201d doesn\u2019t rhyme as well with \u201cJew.\u201d) By formulating the chant as an address in the second person, the emerging \u201cwe\u201d sought to draw its others \u2014 \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 into direct confrontation. As the philosopher Andrea Pitts has argued in response to Arizona\u2019s ethnic studies ban, when the state addresses \u201cproper\u201d subjects such as taxpayers and citizens in laws and speeches about \u201cillegal\u201d others in our midst, they also indirectly address marginalized communities, sending a message of exclusion and intimidation, while maintaining the plausible deniability of civil discourse. Today\u2019s white nationalists prefer to address their target directly, and this is also what they like about Donald Trump.\n\nThe shift from \u201cYou\u201d to \u201cJews\u201d (and from the second person to the third person) makes explicit the totalizing nature of the opposition between \u201cus\u201d and everyone else. What do Jews have to do with General Lee? In one sense, nothing, apart from the usefulness of anti-Semitism for providing a \u201cgeneral framework of the development of the nation-state,\u201d as Hannah Arendt argued in \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

If we understand a nation as an ethno-cultural concept defined by a sense of shared identity, history and ancestry, and the state as a political concept defined by a set of institutions, documents and structures, then it\u2019s pretty clear that most white nationalists want precisely that: a white nation (although Cantwell and others want an \u201cethno-state\u201d). But the fact that white men already occupy most positions of power in the United States is tangential to their primary interest in the nation. Trump seems to share this affection for America the Nation, and accordingly finds America the State\u2019s institutions irrelevant and bothersome.\n\nThe distinction between nation and state helps to explain why Confederate statues are so important to white nationalists, and why Jews were the seemingly odd targets of a protest ostensibly about the removal of a Confederate statue. By identifying with the Confederacy, white nationalists (whether from the Southeast or the Midwest, or even from Quebec) get to adopt the position of an underdog white nation struggling against oppression and occupation by both a coercive state power, and by a group of \u201ccoastal elites\u201d \u2014 a thinly veiled euphemism for rich, well-educated, powerful Jews \u2014 who are seen as not sharing \u201cour\u201d identity, history and ancestry, but who have nevertheless illegitimately seized the important nonstate sites of power: control of the banks and the ideological power of the media.\n\nFramed this way, with the Jews as \u201cglobal conspirators\u201d on one side and the hordes of black and brown upstarts on the other, the demonstrators get to be activists in a valiant struggle for liberation from both sets of oppressors. The statues, which from one perspective might be construed as the effigies of losers, are from the perspective of white nationalists inspiring signs that the struggle continues, that Dixie will rise again.\n\nIn her book, \u201cQueer Phenomenology,\u201d Sara Ahmed shows how a sense of the \u201c \u2018we\u2019 emerges as an effect of a shared direction toward an object.\u201d When the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d protesters tore themselves away from Reddit and Breitbart to march with their tiki torches in Charlottesville, they were gravitating toward an object that they hoped would make them a real \u201cwe,\u201d that is, \u201cunited.\u201d And just in case the statue didn\u2019t work, they also brought a lot of extra swag with them: flags, homemade shields and a boatload of semiautomatic weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe collective ownership of these symbolic objects is crucial to the white nationalist movement. In a landmark essay in critical legal scholarship, Cheryl Harris argues that in the United States, whiteness functions as a kind of a property. A key feature of this property is the right to exclude others from laying claim to whiteness. It is just this right, and this equation of persons with property, that Cantwell asserts when he claims that Trump gave his daughter to a Jew, and remarks that \u201cI don\u2019t think you could feel the way I do about race, and watch that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl.\u201d\n\nHe is at once invoking the age-old, bedrock, patriarchal claim that women are chattel, and denying Kushner\u2019s prima facie whiteness as a postwar American Jew. From this perspective, \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d means more than just \u201cYou will not take down our statue.\u201d It means, \u201cYou will not take away our right to exclude.\u201d This can be finessed into a more defensive message appealing to a broader base: \u201cYou will not exclude us.\u201d You will not make us feel like we don\u2019t matter by asserting that you do.\n\nHistorically, in the United States, white people are the replacers, not the replaced. The chant, \u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d seems to bear an unconscious trace of this history, even as it disavows the contingency of settler nationhood. The historian Patrick Wolfe argues that \u201csettler colonialism destroys to replace,\u201d but that \u201cthe process of replacement maintains the refractory imprint of the native counterclaim.\u201d\n\nWe need to pry apart the equation of personhood and property at the core of white supremacy, understood as a political system and not just a collection of individuals with extreme viewpoints. This equation of personhood and property goes all the way back to Locke\u2019s \u201cSecond Treatise on Government,\u201d which was arguably an inspiration for the American Revolution. Both the American nation and its individual states have been founded on the constitutive exclusion of indigenous people, slaves, women and poor people from full citizenship. In order to address the violence of white (settler) nationalism, we need more than just virtuous tweets against white supremacists. We need to move toward a different understanding of power.\n\nWhile on some level the people who marched in Charlottesville were motivated by a perverse, exceptional hate, they were also, on another level, driven by a very ordinary desire for power. But that desire is based in an impoverished understanding of power as the replacement and domination of others.\n\nWith this definition of power still firmly in place, it will be difficult to come up with any compelling reason white people should divest from the privilege of whiteness.", "publish_date": "2017-08-28", "authors": "Abigail Levin and Lisa Guenther", "type": "article"}
