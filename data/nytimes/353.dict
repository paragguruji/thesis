Orrick of Federal District Court in San Francisco relied on a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. That ruling, which added major complications to the rollout of the health care law, was popular with conservatives.\n\nThe decision, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, was best known for sustaining a central provision of the law, its individual mandate. But the court also ruled that Congress may not impose significant new conditions on existing federal funding, a position pressed by states led by Republicans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Clement, a lawyer for the states challenging the law, to laughter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Orrick said the principle established in 2012 applied to the Trump administration\u2019s threat to withhold federal money from localities that refuse to aid efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court concluded that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s threat of denying Medicaid funds, which constituted over 10 percent of the state\u2019s overall budget, was unconstitutionally coercive and represented a \u2018gun to the head,\u2019\u201d Judge Orrick wrote. \u201cThe executive order threatens to deny sanctuary jurisdictions all federal grants, hundreds of millions of dollars on which the counties rely. The threat is unconstitutionally coercive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump pledged to appeal Judge Orrick\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court, which this month regained a conservative majority with his appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.\n\n\u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d\n\n(The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has not ruled in the sanctuary cities case, though it did affirm a ruling blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban. Judge Orrick is a district court judge whose decisions may be appealed to the Ninth Circuit.)\n\nThough only two California counties had challenged the sanctuary-cities order, Judge Orrick issued a nationwide injunction temporarily blocking it. Here, too, he took a page from what was until recently a Republican litigation playbook. In cases concerning Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives on immigration and transgender rights, individual judges in Texas concluded that nationwide injunctions blocking them were warranted.\n\nRepublicans embraced those rulings. Now they are less certain that individual federal judges should be able to wield such power. \u201cOnce again, a single district judge \u2014 this time in San Francisco \u2014 has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country,\u201d the White House said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban was also halted by a nationwide injunction, entered by a judge in Seattle, and his revised travel ban was blocked by nationwide injunctions from judges in Maryland and Hawaii.\n\nThat last order did not sit well with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who criticized Judge Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu \u2014 \u201ca judge sitting on an island in the Pacific,\u201d as Mr. Sessions put it \u2014 for issuing a ruling that would apply to the whole nation.\n\nBut Judge Watson relied on a 2015 appeals court ruling blocking Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration program that said such nationwide injunctions were required to ensure uniformity. The court affirmed an injunction issued by a single judge in Brownsville, Tex., who said Mr. Obama had exceeded his authority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a senator, Mr. Sessions cheered that ruling, saying it was \u201can injunction that stopped the Obama administration from proceeding with its lawless immigration system.\u201d\n\nBoth sides have been flexible in their understanding of the applicable legal principles, Professor Blackman said.\n\n\u201cWith respect to nationwide injunctions,\u201d he said, \u201cblue state attorney generals are relying on arguments they expressly opposed during the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nIt is time to embrace neutral legal principles, Professor Somin said, whether they help one side or the other in any given case. That would, he said, \u201chelp tamp down the dangerous partisan conflict and hatred that are poisoning our political system.\u201d\n\nNeil S. Siegel, a law professor at Duke, said the Supreme Court and the public should think hard about the recent whiplash-inducing litigation turnabouts.\n\n\u201cA question we will eventually want to ask the justices is a question we should also be asking ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is prepared to be at all principled about these matters?\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-04-27", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
