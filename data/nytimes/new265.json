A 4-to-4 tie on the short-handed Supreme Court would have left the panel\u2019s decision in place.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, issued Jan. 27, caused confusion and protests at airports nationwide and was immediately challenged in court. Many federal judges blocked aspects of the order.\n\nThe broadest injunction was issued on Feb. 3 by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, acting in a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. Judge Robart required the administration to roll back the key aspects of the order, and travel from the affected countries resumed almost immediately.\n\nThe next day, the Justice Department filed an emergency appeal, saying that national security concerns required immediate action from the appeals court. The three-judge panel heard arguments a few days later, and in a unanimous decision last Thursday, it refused to reinstate the ban.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany legal scholars, including ones who disapproved of the ban, have criticized the reasoning in the panel\u2019s ruling. The Justice Department\u2019s brief tracked many of those critiques, saying the panel\u2019s decision was plagued by misunderstandings about the scope of the original executive order and the president\u2019s authority to address immigration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But the states argued that the panel\u2019s ruling had been careful and correct.\n\n\u201cThe panel\u2019s order thoroughly considered the legal precedent and the parties\u2019 arguments and neither overlooked nor misunderstood a point of law or fact,\u201d the brief said.\n\nThe briefs came in response to a request from the appeals court. Last Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit.\n\nIf a majority of the court\u2019s active judges vote to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an 11-member panel made up of the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random.\n\nRehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by three-judge panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges; 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nEven if the Ninth Circuit agrees to vacate the panel\u2019s decision, challenges to the original executive order will continue in other courts. And the new executive order may draw fresh legal challenges.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "ninth", "travel", "case", "judges", "trump", "fighting", "brief", "panels", "court", "issue", "order", "instead", "panel", "decision", "legal"], "summary": "In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week.\nIn calling for a legal do-over, the Justice Department avoided a Supreme Court test of the original executive order.\nA 4-to-4 tie on the short-handed Supreme Court would have left the panel\u2019s decision in place.\n\u201cSuch review is not called for at this time,\u201d the brief said, given the forthcoming executive order.\nEven if the Ninth Circuit agrees to vacate the panel\u2019s decision, challenges to the original executive order will continue in other courts."}
