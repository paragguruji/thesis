Travel to the U.S. while you\u2019re still allowed to!\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist with the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, Pa., said that foreign tourists might be reluctant to visit the United States after the election not only because of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cnationalist\u201d campaign, but also because of the relative strength of the dollar. \u201cThe strength of the dollar plays an important role,\u201d he said. (And the dollar could certainly lose strength, say some in the financial world, depending on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.)\n\nGary Leff, the founder of the View From the Wing travel blog and a co-founder of the frequent flier site InsideFlyer.com, agreed that, for now, the world likely sees the United States as less open to tourism and immigration. (The day after the election, Rafat Ali, the founder of Skift, a travel news and research company, tweeted that the industry was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d and that attendees at the World Travel Market London conference were coming up and \u201coffering condolences.\u201d) That perception is not good for airlines and hotels, Mr. Leff said, though in the short term it could mean that travelers benefit from lower airfares.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether those sentiments last, and if there will be actual policy changes that help or hurt travel to the United States.\n\nFew think that Mr. Trump, and whomever he appoints to his cabinet, will carry out mass deportations and erect a wall between the United States and Mexico, if only because of the impracticalities of such endeavors. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he will build a wall,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt of Atmosphere Research Group. But he said he is concerned that Mr. Trump might break with NATO, and that he might make it more difficult for people to get visas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sacks of Tourism Economics said policy proposals that would undermine longstanding alliances, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could certainly hurt tourism to the United States. But by how much?\n\nHe and his team examined data from 2000 to 2006, comparing arrivals to the United States with the Pew Research Center\u2019s favorability index, which rates America\u2019s image. The takeaway was that while there was a correlation between the perception of a place and the growth in visits to that place, it wasn\u2019t a strong one. Even if Trump the president is not more conciliatory than Trump the campaigner, Mr. Sacks said, the United States is still likely to be an aspirational travel destination because of its arts, culture and diversity. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change in a wholesale way,\u201d he said.\n\nAMERICANS AND THE COST OF TRAVELING ABROAD\n\nWhether Americans travel internationally depends largely on the health of the U.S. economy. A weaker dollar could hurt outbound tourism.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTravel is a discretionary product,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cIf the economy isn\u2019t good, travel is always one of the first areas where consumers start to cut back.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group said that if high-earning Americans end up seeing tax cuts under Mr. Trump, they might decide to travel more.\n\nThe cost of airfare will be interesting to watch. United States legacy airlines like American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines don\u2019t want more competition; they want American travelers to buy their (costly) tickets. To that end, they have been fighting to limit access to the American market by major Gulf carriers like Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways, which would breed competition, pushing the airlines to improve and to lower airfares.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhile that would be a boon to travelers, Mr. Leff said that the legacy airlines are hoping to prevent it by capitalizing on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cprotectionism\u201d to keep their competitors at bay. If that protectionist attitude prevails, options will continue to be limited and prices will continue to be high.\n\nStill, the decision to travel will ultimately be about more than money. It will also hinge on how Americans think they will be treated when they go abroad, something people typically gauge based on what they\u2019re seeing in State Department reports, news media and on their fellow travelers\u2019 Facebook and Twitter feeds. They will ask themselves whether they feel it\u2019s safe to travel, or whether they think, by virtue of their president, they will be targets of anti-American sentiments. \u201cWe are all ambassadors of our country,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be attacked or harassed or looked down upon as an American.\u201d\n\nTRAVELING TO CUBA\n\nCuba is only just opening up to the United States, yet it is already on many travelers\u2019 bucket lists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAirlines and cruise ships have begun taking Americans there, and more hotels are in the works. But during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that unless there is greater political freedom on the island, he might reverse the historic agreement President Obama made with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba. Are Americans still likely to be able to go?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some risk to Cuba policy changing,\u201d said Mr. Leff, because Mr. Trump could issue his own directive. Additionally, Mr. Leff said that the uncertainty surrounding Cuba could delay investment there in terms of new hotels and other travel-related infrastructure, slowing tourism.\n\nMr. Harteveldt, however, thinks that Mr. Trump won\u2019t necessarily back off international trade with Cuba and other places because four years from now, \u201che probably would like to see Trump-branded hotels open in more cities and more countries.\u201d\n\nTRUMP HOTELS\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, his eponymous hotel brand appeared to be in trouble. And when the family announced that a new hotel brand was in the works but that it would not use the Trump name, some companies speculated it was because the Trump brand was indeed tarnished. In May, Hipmunk, the travel comparison site, said that \u201cwhile overall Hipmunk hotel bookings have been on the rise year-over-year, that has not been the case with bookings of Trump Hotels.\u201d The share of Trump bookings on Hipmunk as a percent of total bookings was down 59 percent year over year.\n\nBut now that Mr. Trump will be the next president of the United States, things could be looking up.\n\n\u201cWinning could mitigate whatever damage had been done to the brand,\u201d said Mr. Leff, suggesting that there may be a halo effect from the presidency \u2014 especially the idea of staying at a Trump hotel in the shadow of the White House. Suddenly, he said, the new Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C. is \u201cthe President\u2019s hotel.\u201d\n\nBrand Keys, a customer loyalty research consultancy based in New York, seemed to underscore that notion in a report the day after the election, saying that Trump, \u201ca brand that was once deemed toxic by many consumers is now seen as not only a safe option, but an emotionally desirable option.\u201d\n\nNEW INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Mr. Trump said during his victory speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201d\n\nThat could generate jobs and help the economy. Exactly how that huge increase in spending \u2014 Mr. Trump has pledged to spend nearly $1 trillion on infrastructure \u2014 will be paid for is unclear, said Mr. Leff. Assuming Mr. Trump\u2019s administration finds a way to make it happen (more recently he has suggested creating a federal infrastructure fund supported by government bonds), infrastructure projects still take years. So while there may be new roads and airports, this is a change that\u2019s unlikely to happen in the near term.\n\nChange is one thing the industry can be sure of when Mr. Trump takes office.\n\n\u201cHe could be one of the most travel-friendly presidents in modern history,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt, noting that Mr. Trump has long been part of the travel industry and was deeply involved in the marketing of the Trump Shuttle in its early days \u2014 experience that could he put to use thinking of ways to make the United States a more welcoming and appealing destination. Or, Mr. Harteveldt continued, Mr. Trump could be one of the most travel-unfriendly presidents. \u201cHe has the potential to be at either end of the continuum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe only unlikely outcome, Mr. Harteveldt added, is that Mr. Trump will be in the middle.", "authors": ["Stephanie Rosenbloom", "The Getaway"], "publish_date": "2016-11-10", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "leff", "harteveldt", "research", "united", "trumps", "impact", "continue", "states", "tourism", "mr"], "summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s some risk to Cuba policy changing,\u201d said Mr. Leff, because Mr. Trump could issue his own directive.\nBut now that Mr. Trump will be the next president of the United States, things could be looking up.\nExactly how that huge increase in spending \u2014 Mr. Trump has pledged to spend nearly $1 trillion on infrastructure \u2014 will be paid for is unclear, said Mr. Leff.\nChange is one thing the industry can be sure of when Mr. Trump takes office.\nOr, Mr. Harteveldt continued, Mr. Trump could be one of the most travel-unfriendly presidents."}
