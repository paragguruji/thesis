Niemeyer said Mr. Trump\u2019s official actions should not be assessed based on his earlier statements. \u201cCan we look at his college speeches?\u201d Judge Niemeyer asked. \u201cHow about his speeches to businessmen 20 years ago?\u201d\n\nJeffrey B. Wall, the acting United States solicitor general, said the court should not look behind the revised executive order to assess Mr. Trump\u2019s motives. Most of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were made before he took the oath of office, formed a government and took advice from cabinet officials. \u201cCandidates talk about things on the campaign trail all the time,\u201d Mr. Wall said.\n\nHe added that the order concerned national security, an area in which courts should be reluctant to second-guess the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Muslim ban,\u201d Mr. Wall said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with religion. Its operation has nothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\nBut Judge Pamela A. Harris said that even if the order was neutral on its face, \u201cit has a disparate impact on Muslims.\u201d\n\nJudge Barbara Milano Keenan said the order was very broad. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 82 million people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has to be something about those people\u2019s nationality that renders them suspect.\u201d\n\nJudge Keenan pressed Mr. Wall about the limits of his position. Suppose, she said, that a candidate had said daily that he would ban Muslims on his first day in office because \u201cthey\u2019re bad people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDo you really mean we can\u2019t consider the statements?\u201d she asked.\n\nMr. Wall said there might be reason to do so if the situation were that extreme.\n\nJudge Dennis W. Shedd urged Mr. Wall to be careful about his concessions. \u201cYou\u2019re cracking that door,\u201d Judge Shedd said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union representing people and groups challenging the order, said the volume and specificity of the comments from Mr. Trump and his advisers could not be ignored. He was repeatedly pressed by Judge Niemeyer on whether the order was problematic on its own.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to answer the question of whether this order on its face is legitimate,\u201d Judge Niemeyer said.\n\nJudge King said the two sides were separated by a wide gulf on the central question in the case: that of whether to interpret the order in isolation or in the context of the various statements. \u201cThat\u2019s where you all are like ships in the night,\u201d Judge King told Mr. Jadwat. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important issue in the whole case.\u201d\n\nThe revised order, issued in March, sought to address judicial objections to an earlier one, issued in January. The first order, which caused chaos and drew protests at airports around the nation, was blocked in February by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.\n\nThe new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. It omitted Iraq, which had been listed in the earlier order. It removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. And it deleted explicit references to religion. Like the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 120,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn March, federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked parts of the new executive order, saying they could not ignore the remarks from Mr. Trump and his allies. \u201cSimply because a decision maker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them\u201d from judicial memory, Judge Theodore D. Chuang of Federal District Court in Maryland wrote in the decision under review by the appeals court.\n\nJudge Chuang\u2019s ruling blocked the part of the order concerning travel from the six countries.\n\nThe court hearing the case on Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, did not follow its usual practices in considering the appeal. Ordinarily, a three-judge panel would have heard the case and decided it, with the possibility of full-court review afterward.\n\nSkipping that step and scheduling arguments before the full court signaled the exceptional importance of the case. So did the court\u2019s decision to allow C-Span to broadcast live audio coverage of the arguments.\n\nNine of the judges who heard Monday\u2019s arguments were appointed by Democratic presidents and three by Republican ones. Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory was initially appointed by President Bill Clinton during a Senate recess and was later reappointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, recused himself, presumably because Mr. Wall, the government lawyer, is his son-in-law. Judge Allyson Kay Duncan, appointed by Mr. Bush, also disqualified herself, without giving a reason.\n\nNext Monday, the Ninth Circuit will hear a separate appeal of another decision blocking aspects of the revised travel ban, from the federal judge in Hawaii. That appeal will be heard by a three-judge panel.\n\nMr. Wall argued that presidents have vast constitutional and statutory authority over immigration. Under a 1972 Supreme Court immigration decision, he said, judges should not second-guess the government\u2019s \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d for denying visas.\n\nMore recently, in a fractured 5-to-4 decision in 2015 with no majority opinion, the Supreme Court refused to second-guess the denial of a visa on national security grounds to the Afghan husband of an American woman. In a concurrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it might be proper to look behind the offered reason for the denial if there was evidence that the consular officer had acted in bad faith.\n\nMr. Jadwat, the lawyer for the challengers, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were evidence of such bad faith. He added that cases claiming religious discrimination require a different analysis from the one courts usually use in immigration cases. In religion cases, he said, motives matter.", "publish_date": "2017-05-08", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
