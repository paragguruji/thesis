They\u2019re so surprised: \u2018Oh, he is having strong borders.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.\u201d\n\nBut his early efforts to translate all of that talk into action are already running into the reality of governing in Washington, where legal constraints on taking action \u2014 and debates about paying for it \u2014 are legendary.\n\nMr. Trump has promised to hire 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a larger deportation force that can remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, something he repeatedly promised to do during the campaign.\n\nBut hiring such a large number of agents in a short period of time would be nearly impossible, according to John F. Kelly, the former general whom Mr. Trump chose to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to get 10,000 and 5,000 on board within the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Kelly told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this month, explaining that stringent hiring standards and training regimens slow down the process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have fewer and make sure that they\u2019re high-quality people that are already serving in those organizations, already well trained, but I will not skimp on the training and the standards,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\n\nOne of the problems that Mr. Kelly faces is a polygraph test that prospective agents, including those seeking to work for the Border Patrol, must take. According to a former senior homeland security official, nearly 60 percent of applicants fail it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe test was first put in place after another surge in hiring during the George W. Bush administration. Thousands of people were hired without being properly vetted, which resulted in dozens of corruption cases involving Border Patrol and other agents, who were accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.\n\nThe former senior homeland security official, James Tomsheck, who was the assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, office of internal affairs, said in several cases many of the new hires were members of the cartels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Christensen, the acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the memorandum was a \u201cvery early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary and was never seriously considered by the department.\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday morning that the report by The Associated Press was \u201c100 percent not true.\u201d\n\nBut advocates for immigrants reacted with alarm.\n\n\u201cThe administration wants to put on a show,\u201d said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York. \u201cTheir intent is to create fear, to create an environment in which people either self-deport or hide in the shadows.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to deploy 100,000 troops would be a stark increase in the size and scope of National Guard involvement in border security, but it is not unprecedented.\n\nSeveral presidents, including George Bush and Barack Obama, called up thousands of National Guard troops to bolster border patrol operations. While they mostly acted as extra eyes to spot illegal border crossings, at times they carried weapons and assisted in drug arrests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1916, in response to cross-border raids by Mexican bandits and what The New York Times described as a \u201cprairie fire of anti-American sentiment that has been sweeping northern Mexico,\u201d President Woodrow Wilson deployed more than 100,000 guardsmen to the border to reinforce regular Army units.\n\nMore recently, in July 2014, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to its border with Mexico in an effort to bolster his border-security credentials as he prepared to start his presidential campaign.\n\nThe deployment has been costly, controversial and continues to this day. The troops live in hotels along the border during their deployments, and the estimate of the costs in 2014 were $12 million a month.\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s efforts coincided with an influx of undocumented Central American immigrants coming across the border, including unaccompanied children and teenagers. Experts expect another surge in arrivals this spring.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order calling for an end to \u201ccatch and release,\u201d he also directed Mr. Kelly to do everything possible to \u201cconstruct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\u201d Immigration experts said that will be costly and take time.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is,\u201d Mr. Appleby said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing everything they can legally do until they\u2019re told not to by the courts to expand their capacity to deport as many people as possible.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-17", "authors": "Michael D.
