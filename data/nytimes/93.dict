She added that associating the military with \u201cunconstitutional policies is especially damaging, since our military take their oath to the Constitution, not to the president.\u201d\n\nThe president cited the Sept. 11 attacks in his decision to issue the immigration restrictions, which he cast in national security terms. \u201cWe will never forget the lessons of 9/11,\u201d he said, nor the people \u201cwho lost their lives at the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Military officials have repeatedly called the nation an American ally.\n\n\u201cAfter all the money and lives spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon knows better than anyone that terrorism is a problem of a small number of enemies embedded in a population of people you need to win over,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI don\u2019t see the part of this that\u2019s meant to win over anyone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo people close to Mr. Mattis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they were wary of undercutting him, said he was still sharply opposed to the Muslim ban. But he spent this week battling the White House on other issues, including the establishment of \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria, something the Pentagon has long opposed because it would deepen American involvement in the war there, out of the executive order.\n\nMilitary officials sought to distance the Pentagon from the immigration ban, and focused instead on the second executive order that Mr. Trump signed at the Pentagon, which called for plans to improve military readiness. Mr. Mattis, standing behind Mr. Trump, took only the ceremonial pen that Mr. Trump used to sign the military readiness order. Mr. Trump gave the other one to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAfterward, the Defense Department put out a statement about Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to the Pentagon that pointedly made no mention of the Muslim ban. \u201cThe secretary shares the president\u2019s goal of ensuring our military leaders have the support they need to accelerate the campaign against ISIS, and to build combat readiness now and for the future,\u201d Capt. Jeff Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, said in the statement.\n\nLast week, the Defense Department posted a message on Twitter about a former refugee who became a Marine. \u201cFrom refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes the fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out,\u201d it read.\n\nA military official noted on Saturday that the American military, which uses translators and fixers in Iraq and Syria, two of the countries on the banned list, would find it harder to recruit, since the Pentagon has long offered the promise of refuge in America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for people to cooperate with the United States military when they feel humiliated by the United States,\u201d said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cThe Iraqi situation is the most grievous,\u201d Mr. Nasr added. \u201cWe are fighting a war with the Iraqis, against ISIS. How can we fight with them when the message from the White House is discriminatory?\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Helene Cooper", "type": "article"}
