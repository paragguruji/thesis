Their refusal to do so had provoked a national uproar.\n\nThe challenge of integrating immigrants has spilled over into culture, and, at times, helped fan a simmering culture war. In Denmark, pork meatballs and other pork dishes that are popular staples became part of a debate on national identity last year after the central Danish town of Randers voted in January to require public day care centers and kindergartens to include the meat on their lunch menus.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Critics said the proposal did nothing more than stigmatize Muslims, who had made no attempts to ban pork from school menus.\n\nGermany was shaken during New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne in 2015 when young men, many of them of North African origin, committed sexual assaults during the street celebrations there. The attacks became an uncomfortable symbol of the challenges of integration in the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn France, the clash between secularism and religious conservatism came into sharp relief this summer when nearly 30 towns, mainly in the country\u2019s southeast, introduced burkini bans, suggesting that the garments impinged upon French culture and way of life.\n\nIn the case of the swimming classes in Switzerland, the authorities ruled that lessons mixing boys and girls were an important part of the school curriculum; they did allow that the girls could apply for an exemption on religious grounds, but only if they had gone through puberty, which was not the case for the daughters of Mr. Osmanoglu and Ms. Kocabas.\n\nThe parents argued that even though the Quran does not require girls\u2019 bodies to be covered until puberty, \u201ctheir belief commanded them to prepare their daughters for the precepts that would be applied to them from puberty\u201d onward, according to the court\u2019s summary of the case.\n\nThe decision, by a chamber of seven judges, did not dispute that the denial of the parents\u2019 request interfered with their religious freedom, but it emphasized that the need for social cohesion and integration trumped the family\u2019s wishes. The court also noted that schools play \u201ca special role in the process of social integration, particularly where children of foreign origin were concerned,\u201d and that, as such, ensuring the girls\u2019 \u201csuccessful social integration according to local customs and mores\u201d took precedence over religious concerns.\n\nThe parents have three months to appeal the court\u2019s decision. Representatives of the family could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn Switzerland, politicians and civic groups across the political spectrum welcomed the ruling, calling it an important validation of the supremacy of secularism and the rule of law, even as some Muslims complained that it reflected growing intolerance for religious minorities.\n\n\u201cThe swimming pool verdict unfortunately is what we expected,\u201d Qaasim Illi, a board member of the Swiss Central Islamic Council, wrote on Twitter. \u201cTolerance toward the religious is diminishing throughout Europe.\u201d", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"], "publish_date": "2017-01-10", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["case", "national", "swimming", "classes", "pork", "court", "attend", "integration", "girls", "religious", "school", "swim", "switzerland", "social", "muslim", "boys"], "summary": "The ruling could set an important precedent in other cases in which religious and secular values or norms come into conflict.\nThe challenge of integrating immigrants has spilled over into culture, and, at times, helped fan a simmering culture war.\nSupporters of the proposal said that serving traditional Danish food such as pork was essential to help preserve national identity.\nCritics said the proposal did nothing more than stigmatize Muslims, who had made no attempts to ban pork from school menus.\nThe court also noted that schools play \u201ca special role in the process of social integration, particularly where children of foreign origin were concerned,\u201d and that, as such, ensuring the girls\u2019 \u201csuccessful social integration according to local customs and mores\u201d took precedence over religious concerns."}
