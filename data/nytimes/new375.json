Pressed to clarify in an interview with the BBC, Ms. Rudd said: \u201cThe intelligence services know a lot of people. I\u2019m sure we will find out what level they knew him in due course. But at the moment all they have confirmed is that they did know about him.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Mr. Abedi\u2019s trip to Libya last month, the French interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, has said he also had most likely traveled to Syria. It is unclear whether these visits occurred in the same trip, and whether he had caught the attention of law enforcement before, during or after.\n\nAs a British citizen, Mr. Abedi had the \u201cright of abode,\u201d meaning he did not have to obtain the permission of an immigration officer and could simply enter the United Kingdom, though the government could revoke this right.\n\nSocial media posts are spreading hoaxes about missing children.\n\nPeople took to social media to search for loved ones lost in the chaos that followed the explosion, which occurred at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena. But many well-wishers and social media good Samaritans have been duped into sharing fake reports of missing victims. In a cruel sign of social savvy, many of the most successful frauds have used fake photos and back stories children, as The Washington Post and BuzzFeed have reported.\n\nOne account posted a plea to find \u201cmy son\u201d that was retweeted over 19,000 times.\n\nBut the person pictured is a popular YouTube user, who posted a video denying the claim and calling the post \u201cfake news\u201d from online trolls \u201cjust to try to get some laughs out it.\u201d He offered his condolences to the victims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He was 2 or 3 years old then. He\u2019s certainly not missing,\u201d said Karen Bowersox, the executive director of Downs Designs Dreams. Twitter suspended the account that posted the claim.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers are misdirecting parents to hotels where they claim dozens of unaccompanied children are staying.\n\nIn the confusion of the attack, many were pointing frantic parents to Manchester-area hotels.\n\nBut InterContinental Hotels, the parent company of Holiday Inn, told The New York Times that the rumors were not accurate.\n\n\u201cThere has been reports of a number of unaccompanied children being brought to a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express in the area. However, these are incorrect,\u201d said Gemma Bull, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cOur hotels were working with police throughout the night, but we did not have a large group of unaccompanied children at our hotel.\u201d\n\nThe Greater Manchester police have also denied the rumor.\n\nTwitter users appear to be misinterpreting Facebook posts from a woman named Paula Robinson, who said she ushered 50 children to Holiday Inn after the explosion. She would stay with them as they awaited their parents, Ms. Robinson wrote.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Ms. Robinson said that after the attack, she and her husband were carrying two children and told the crowd to seek refuge at the Holiday Inn before posting her messages on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten mistaken that I am the help line,\u201d she said, adding that hundreds of parents have called her inquiring about their children, but \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSome are taking old allegations about Ariana Grande out of context.\n\nSome users are resurfacing reports from 2014 that Ms. Grande had said she hoped her fans would \u201cdie.\u201d These rumors were denied by Ms. Grande\u2019s representatives at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Trump forum on Reddit claimed that BuzzFeed had removed its article about Ms. Grande\u2019s alleged remark in a \u201clittle cover-up.\u201d BuzzFeed temporarily removed the article before posting an update with the original text to reflect that the singer\u2019s three-year-old remarks were \u201cunrelated to the attack.\u201d\n\nThe original article was based on comments from an unnamed \u201cindustry insider\u201d to The Daily News in a larger article about Ms. Grande\u2019s \u201cdiva behavior.\u201d A representative for Ms. Grande called the allegation untrue, and Ms. Grande indirectly rebutted it on Twitter.\n\nAfter the bombing, Ms. Grande suspended her tour and offered her condolences on social media.", "authors": ["Linda Qiu"], "publish_date": "2017-05-24", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["inn", "holiday", "social", "post", "hoaxes", "media", "parents", "check", "rumors", "fact", "ms", "manchester", "children", "bombing", "grande", "users"], "summary": "But many well-wishers and social media good Samaritans have been duped into sharing fake reports of missing victims.\nBut InterContinental Hotels, the parent company of Holiday Inn, told The New York Times that the rumors were not accurate.\n\u201cThere has been reports of a number of unaccompanied children being brought to a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express in the area.\nShe would stay with them as they awaited their parents, Ms. Robinson wrote.\nAfter the bombing, Ms. Grande suspended her tour and offered her condolences on social media."}
