Watson, of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, said he could not dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt talk. \u201cA review of the historical background here makes plain why the government wishes to focus on the executive order\u2019s text, rather than its context,\u201d Judge Watson wrote. \u201cThe record before this court is unique. It includes significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the executive order.\u201d\n\nThe courts had to navigate two bodies of precedents, pointing in different directions. In cases concerning immigration and national security, most decisions suggest that courts should not look behind the stated government rationale.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s new executive order sought to address judicial objections to the earlier one, issued in January, which had caused chaos and drawn protests at airports. It was blocked last month by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.\n\nThe new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. The new order omitted Iraq, which had been listed in the earlier order. It removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. And it deleted explicit references to religion.\n\nViewed in isolation, Judge Watson wrote on Wednesday, the new order was just fine. \u201cIt is undisputed that the executive order does not facially discriminate for or against any particular religion, or for or against religion versus nonreligion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no express reference, for instance, to any religion nor does the executive order \u2014 unlike its predecessor \u2014 contain any term or phrase that can be reasonably characterized as having a religious origin or connotation.\u201d\n\nThe problem, the judge said, was that Mr. Trump and his surrogates had made plain what the order meant to achieve: discrimination on the basis of religion in violation of the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s most explicit statements about banning Muslims came during the campaign. In a news release in December 2015, for instance, his campaign said, \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d In a television interview last March, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re having problems with the Muslims, and we\u2019re having problems with Muslims coming into the country.\u201d\n\nAfter he was elected, Mr. Trump was less direct, but he did say he meant to favor Christian refugees. Rudolph W. Giuliani, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said he had helped draft the first executive order after Mr. Trump asked him, about a Muslim ban, \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nThe challengers in the Maryland case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were not \u201ca passing comment on the campaign trail or a clear example of campaign puffery.\u201d They were, rather, the brief said, \u201ca consistent pledge to take discriminatory action,\u201d making the case \u201chighly unusual, if not entirely unique.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, took account of campaign materials from Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court to judge his actions concerning a Ten Commandments monument in his courthouse.\n\nIn the context of immigration and efforts to combat terror, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to look behind official actions to root out authentic motives. In 2006, in a case concerning detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, Justice John Paul Stevens criticized a dissenting justice for relying on \u201cpress statements\u201d from sitting Defense Department officials. \u201cWe have not heretofore, in evaluating the legality of executive action, deferred to comments made by such officials to the media,\u201d Justice Stevens wrote. If even statements from government officials are out of bounds, it would follow that statement from political candidates should carry no weight.\n\nIn a 1972 immigration case concerning a Marxist scholar denied a visa, the Supreme Court similarly said it would not \u201clook behind\u201d the government\u2019s \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason.\u201d\n\nMore recently, in a fractured 5-to-4 decision in 2015 with no majority opinion, the Supreme Court refused to second-guess the denial of a visa on national security grounds to the Afghan husband of an American woman. In a concurrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it might be proper to look behind the offered reason for the denial if there were evidence that consular officer had acted in bad faith.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a dissent in the Ninth Circuit, five judges said the 1972 decision should have been the end of the matter in a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s first executive order. \u201cEven if we have questions about the basis for the president\u2019s ultimate findings \u2014 whether it was a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 or something else \u2014 we do not get to peek behind the curtain,\u201d Judge Jay S. Bybee wrote for the dissenters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Supreme Court has been more willing to probe officials\u2019 motives in cases concerning religion. In 2005, in a case concerning copies of the Ten Commandments posted in Kentucky county courthouses, the Supreme Court said it would consider the context and background of the policies that had led to their display.\n\nExamination of officials\u2019 actual purposes was appropriate, Justice Souter wrote for the majority, \u201cwhere an understanding of official objective emerges from readily discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\u2019s heart of hearts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is not made brand new every morning,\u201d Justice Souter wrote.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["haunt", "executive", "wrote", "pledges", "trump", "supreme", "judge", "court", "trumps", "justice", "order", "mr", "campaign"], "summary": "Justice Department lawyers had urged the judges to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches on the campaign trail.\nMr. Trump\u2019s new executive order sought to address judicial objections to the earlier one, issued in January, which had caused chaos and drawn protests at airports.\nIn the context of immigration and efforts to combat terror, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to look behind official actions to root out authentic motives.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyBut the Supreme Court has been more willing to probe officials\u2019 motives in cases concerning religion.\nIn 2005, in a case concerning copies of the Ten Commandments posted in Kentucky county courthouses, the Supreme Court said it would consider the context and background of the policies that had led to their display."}
