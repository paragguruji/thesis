And United posted a statement on its site that said customers who meet the qualifications of the ban by Mr. Trump, a Republican, will not be permitted to board a United- or United Express-operated flight to the United States. \u201cIf you have travel plans that are affected by this new regulation, please contact the United Customer Contact Center,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAt the same time, rallies at airports in American cities did not largely affect travelers. Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta, said that the airline is \u201caware of protests at several airports but as of now there is no operational impact.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Shivani Vora", "type": "article"}
