It is instead the prospect of ramped-up enforcement that promises to increase misery on both sides of the border. The criminalizing of law-abiding immigrants who have lived in the United States for years, and of the migrants from Central America who arrive desperate for refuge. The households sundered, the jobs lost, the brutal idiocy of it all.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The orders sweep away the priorities set by President Barack Obama and his homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, under which agents were told to focus strictly on public-safety risks.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s federal force, especially if it re-enlists state and local law enforcement agencies in a widening immigration dragnet, threatens to return America to a disgraceful era of workplace raids, indiscriminate sweeps and mass arrests. This will fix nothing, except perhaps the bottom lines in the private prison industry.\n\nIt is time to watch closely what Mr. Trump says, and what he and his administration do. Watch Mr. Sessions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, agencies with rogue officers who have abused immigrants and broken the law, and local law enforcement, like the Phoenix police, whose officers abetted ICE in subduing protesters who tried to block Ms. Rayos\u2019s removal.\n\nWhere does hope lie? Perhaps in the courts, where judges have resisted unconstitutional anti-immigrant policies. (Reinstatement of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban from certain predominantly Muslim countries was blocked by a federal appeals court on Thursday.) Certainly, hope lies on the ground: Arizona has a seasoned, scarred but ferociously determined corps of immigrant-rights advocates and lawyers who have seen these battles before, under the recently ousted immigrant brutalizer of Maricopa County, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The state has journalists who have covered the lies, the boasting, the abuses of power by anti-immigrant demagogues.\n\nMr. Trump faces other serious obstacles. He is worrying the agriculture industry, which is heavily dependent on workers Mr. Trump calls criminals. The immigration courts are already vastly overburdened, even before a Trump-led onslaught of cases. And a growing constellation of so-called sanctuary cities, towns and states is pledging not to cooperate in the president\u2019s crackdown. Their resistance will be formidable.\n\nBut for countless innocent immigrant families, the hard question is what to do now. Advocates were mobilizing on Thursday night after reports of scores of immigration arrests across the country, from Southern California to Texas. Ms. Rayos\u2019s lawyer, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said immigrants should realize that what happened to her could easily happen to them. He suggested they use great caution in dealing with ICE, and consider the possibility of seeking sanctuary in a church.", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
