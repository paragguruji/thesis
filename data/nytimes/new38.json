The huge increase last year was also the biggest annual rise since 2001, he said.\n\nThe rise came even as hate crimes against almost all other groups \u2014 including blacks, Hispanics, Jews, gays and whites \u2014 either declined or increased only slightly, his study found. One exception was hate crimes against transgender people, which rose about 40 percent.\n\nAn advance copy of the study was provided to The New York Times.\n\nThe statistics almost certainly understate the extent of the problem, researchers say, because victims are often reluctant to report attacks for fear of inflaming community tensions, and because it is sometimes difficult for investigators to establish that religious, ethnic or racial hatred was a cause.\n\nIn the killing last year of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, N.C., for instance, the authorities did not bring hate crime charges against a neighbor who is charged with murdering them, despite calls from Muslims who said there were religious overtones to the violence. The police said that a parking dispute, not bigotry, may have led to the killings.\n\nSometimes, the evidence is more clear-cut.\n\n\u201cI hate ISLAM!\u201d a former Marine named Ted Hakey Jr. wrote to a friend on Facebook after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris. Hours later, in a drunken rampage, he fired a high-powered rifle four times into the mosque next door to his Connecticut home.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And in Queens, a man was beaten in April by three strangers who shouted \u201cISIS, ISIS.\u201d\n\nIn Minneapolis, a man shouting obscenities about Islam shot two Muslim men in traditional religious garb in June, the authorities said.\n\nIn St. Louis, a man was arrested in February after the police said he pointed a gun at a Muslim family shopping on his block and told them they \u201call should die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, an imam in Queens and his assistant were shot and killed execution-style on the sidewalk. The authorities have charged a 35-year-old man in the attack but have not determined a motive or whether it should be treated as a hate crime.\n\nThe increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials.\n\n\u201cWe saw it after 9/11, and we continue to see an uptick in allegations of hate-related incidents today following the tragic events over the past year,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.\n\n\u201cWe see criminal threats against mosques; harassment in schools; and reports of violence targeting Muslim-Americans, Sikhs, people of Arab or South-Asian descent and people perceived to be members of these groups,\u201d Ms. Gupta said.\n\nThe Justice Department has moved to draw public attention to the problem and marshal resources to combat it as part of a broader effort against religious discrimination.\n\nA number of experts in hate crimes said they were concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol may have legitimized threatening or even violent conduct by a small fringe of his supporters.\n\nIn a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump.\n\nThe police here in Washington released a videotape in May of a woman who reportedly poured liquid on a Muslim woman after berating Islam and declaring that she was going to vote for Mr. Trump so that he could \u201csend you all back where you came from.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hillary Clinton charged that Mr. Trump had \u201cincited violence\u201d in a campaign marked by \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201chatred.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s supporters say that he has never endorsed violence against any minorities, and some conservatives have challenged data showing an increase in violence against American Muslims as a creation of liberal-leaning researchers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has said he is not responsible for any violence by his supporters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not angry about something I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in March. \u201cI\u2019m just a messenger. The people are angry about the fact that, for 12 years, the workers in this country haven\u2019t had a pay increase.\u201d\n\nJames Nolan, a former F.B.I. crime analyst who teaches about hate crimes at West Virginia University, said that the data seemed to show \u201ca real spike\u201d in hate crimes against American Muslims, caused in part by candidates\u2019 \u201craising the specter that radical Islam is at our doorstep.\u201d\n\nMark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups and extremism, went further.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest doubt that Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric has played a big part\u201d in the rising attacks, he said.", "authors": ["Eric Lichtblau"], "publish_date": "2016-09-18", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["post911", "continue", "mr", "hate", "man", "era", "trumps", "crimes", "islam", "study", "muslims", "american", "violence"], "summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThat was the most since the record 481 documented hate crimes against Muslims in 2001, when the Sept. 11 attacks set off waves of crimes targeting Muslims and Middle Easterners, Mr. Levin said.\nOne exception was hate crimes against transgender people, which rose about 40 percent.\n\u201cI hate ISLAM!\u201d a former Marine named Ted Hakey Jr. wrote to a friend on Facebook after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris.\nThe increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials.\nIn a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump."}
