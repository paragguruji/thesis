It should be prohibited wherever legally possible.\u201d\n\nShe did not say what circumstances that included. But the language seemed more expansive than she had previously used.\n\nLast summer, when debates broke out across Europe over the so-called burkini swimsuit, Ms. Merkel and other German leaders said they favored a partial ban on full veils.\n\nAt that time, Ms. Merkel had said that \u201cfrom my standpoint, a fully veiled woman scarcely has a chance at full integration in Germany.\u201d But rather than push any new law on face coverings, she and other government officials seemed to prefer the application of common sense. Faces cannot be covered, for instance, when going through a security check at airports.\n\nHer statements on Tuesday appeared to expand that definition, though clearly some of her party\u2019s members wanted more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJenovan Krishnan, 25, the leader of the Ring of Christian Democrat Students, a group with 8,000 members in several universities, said he and his associates wanted an explicit ban on face veils.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She was the top vote-getter in elections for the six deputies at the congress on Tuesday.\n\nThe atmosphere at the conference was less tense than at last year\u2019s, Mr. Krishnan said. Fewer migrants have arrived since spring, when Balkan states largely closed their borders to migrants. The migrant flow through Turkey has also dropped sharply since Ms. Merkel arranged a European Union agreement to pay the Turks to care for migrants and prevent them from heading west to Central Europe.\n\nIn the prelude to the party conference, Ms. Merkel had attended a series of regional meetings, occasionally facing a demand to resign, or hostile criticism of her decision to allow migrants free passage in 2015.\n\nLittle of those critiques surfaced at the briskly managed conference on Tuesday, and Ms. Merkel won a 12-minute standing ovation. She was reaffirmed in the party leadership she has held since 2000 by a thumping 89.5 percent of votes from 994 party delegates.\n\nThe campaign ahead, she suggested, had not been made easier by the result of the United States election \u2014 a rare rhetorical distance for a German chancellor, particularly one from the center-right Christian Democratic Union.\n\nWashington is easily Germany\u2019s most important ally outside Europe. While not mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Ms. Merkel indicated that his victory could make it harder to define global policy and tackle international security challenges.\n\n\u201cA good quarter century after the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the two blocs, many people have the feeling that the world has gone off the rails,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a world situation \u2014 and that is especially true after the American elections \u2014 in which the world must first sort itself out,\u201d she added. \u201cEspecially when looking at important things like NATO and the relationship to Russia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe also repeated as general principle the catalog of beliefs in freedom and equal treatment for all that she cited as her basis for cooperation with Mr. Trump the day after he was elected.\n\nMs. Merkel was critical of Russia, noting that it was supporting Syria in the bombing of Aleppo. She also said that \u201csomething is not right\u201d in Germany, as tens of thousands here have rallied against an American-European free-trade pact while \u201cnot a single person\u201d has marched against the tragedy unfurling in Aleppo.\n\nAs a measure of the challenges ahead in politically unpredictable times, Ms. Merkel appealed for support as she enters the election campaign. \u201cPeople told me I must stand again,\u201d she told her party members. \u201cYou must, you must, help me.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-12-06", "authors": "Alison Smale", "type": "article"}
