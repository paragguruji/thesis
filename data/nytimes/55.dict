Barely six months after the decision, in fact, Eugene Rostow, a law professor who later become the dean of the Yale Law School and an under secretary of state in the Johnson administration, said as much in an essay titled \u201cThe Japanese-American Cases: A Disaster.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

On the factual side, the government submitted incomplete and false evidence to the court in claiming military necessity for the internment program, suppressing the fact that allegations of Japanese-American espionage had been refuted by the F.B.I. and military intelligence. And the Supreme Court had been told that military authorities feared an invasion of the West Coast, which they in fact did not.\n\nThe legal problems ran even deeper. In his opinion for the court in Korematsu, Justice Hugo Black said that it would be easy to rule against the government if the case had involved \u201cthe imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice.\u201d But he improbably insisted that there was no racial discrimination against interned Japanese-Americans because security, not prejudice, motivated the military to order the internments.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s deference to executive judgment on the domestic front in order to overcome the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment would now be almost unthinkable. Under current doctrine, a court would have to give such a government action the highest degree of scrutiny. To the extent Korematsu did not involve this close scrutiny, it has arguably already been overruled sub rosa by the cases that established those scrutiny norms.\n\nThe strongest argument for treating Korematsu as viable precedent is that no matter how wrong a judicial decision is, it remains the law of the land until the court reverses it. But even this \u201cformalist\u201d view may be tempered by the \u201clegal realist\u201d idea that the law may be defined as a prediction of what the courts will do.\n\nAs a predictive matter, the Supreme Court is extremely unlikely to rely on Korematsu. It has been widely disparaged by courts and scholars. Congress repudiated it directly in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which paid reparations to detainees, and in the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which prohibits the detention of citizens without trial. When Justice Stephen G. Breyer described the Korematsu decision in his recent book as \u201cdiscredited,\u201d he wasn\u2019t going out on a limb, but reflecting a legal consensus.\n\nAdmittedly, bad decisions have been resurrected by the Supreme Court. In 2004, a doubtful World War II-era precedent, Ex Parte Quirin, which involved the detention, trial and execution of German saboteurs, was relied on by the Supreme Court to justify the detention of unlawful combatants. Ex Parte Quirin has now joined the mainstream of legal doctrine despite almost a half-century of neglect and a problematic legal pedigree.\n\nBut Korematsu is different. It has entered what the legal scholar Richard Primus has called the \u201canti-canon,\u201d a body of cases that lawyers treat as exemplars of bad legal decision making. These are cases like Plessy v. Ferguson, which articulated the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine. Even arch-conservative justices would have to think long and hard before going against this prevailing view.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKorematsu\u2019s uniquely bad legal status means it\u2019s not precedent even though it hasn\u2019t been overturned. Relying on it would be bad constitutional law.", "publish_date": "2016-11-21", "authors": "Noah Feldman", "type": "article"}
