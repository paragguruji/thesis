But its plan to present the North American premiere of a work by the Syrian playwright Mohammad al-Attar risks being stopped at the United States border if President Trump\u2019s travel ban is upheld.\n\nTo present the play, \u201cWhile I Was Waiting,\u201d Lincoln Center is seeking visas for several artists with passports from Syria \u2014 one of several predominantly Muslim nations from which the Trump administration has sought to temporarily ban travelers. The recent pair of executive orders seeking the ban were both blocked by court orders. The festival is hoping the visas will be granted.\n\n\u201cOur choice of artists predated the travel ban,\u201d Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival, said in an email. \u201cBut the very idea of the ban shows how important it is for us to have greater understanding of the world beyond our own borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I Was Waiting,\u201d about the travails of a middle-class family in Damascus, is one of several international plays planned for this summer\u2019s festival, which will run from July 10 to 30. The festival will begin with \u201cOpening Skinner\u2019s Box,\u201d from Britain\u2019s Improbable Theater, and will feature two productions from Israel: David Grossman\u2019s \u201cTo the End of the Land\u201d and Amos Gitai\u2019s \u201cYitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination.\u201d\n\nDance Companies From Around the World\n\nA previously announced highlight of the festival will be an unusual international performance of George Balanchine\u2019s \u201cJewels,\u201d with the Paris Opera Ballet, New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet trading acts of a work that evokes different national dance styles.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Bolshoi will also perform the American premiere of \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew,\u201d choreographed by Jean-Christophe Maillot and with music by Shostakovich. And Aur\u00e9lie Dupont, the director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, will appear in \u201cSleeping Water,\u201d with the Japanese choreographer-dancer Saburo Teshigawara and his troupe, Karas.\n\nAnd the circus will come to the Rose Theater: \u201cIl N\u2019est Pas Encore Minuit\u201d features the 22 acrobats of the French circus collective Compagnie XY.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Tribute to Ornette Coleman\n\nThe festival will play tribute to the jazz saxophonist and innovative composer Ornette Coleman, who died in 2015 at 85, with a series of programs. One will be a screening of \u201cNaked Lunch,\u201d David Cronenberg\u2019s 1991 film adaptation of that William S. Burroughs novel, while the score, which Coleman co-wrote, is played live by Ensemble Signal, with guests including Coleman\u2019s son, Denardo; Ravi Coltrane; and Henry Threadgill.\n\nGong Linna, the Chinese vocalist, will join the Bang on a Can All-Stars from New York in \u201cCloud River Mountain,\u201d a staged work composed by Lao Luo, Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe.\n\nAnd Morton Subotnick, the pioneering American composer of electronic music, will mark the 50th anniversary of his influential \u201cSilver Apples of the Moon\u201d by performing it at the Stanley H.
