Democrats fear he could wipe away progress in civil rights, changes in sentencing and police accountability.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is likely to be one of the most transformed departments in the cabinet in a Trump administration, and with an Attorney General Sessions, you\u2019d obviously see a very strong law-and-order figure at the top,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor.\n\n\u201cMuch of his self-identity is as a prosecutor \u2014 a real, in-the-trenches prosecutor,\u201d said Mr. Turley, who testified before Mr. Sessions at a Senate hearing last year about the Obama administration\u2019s use of executive authority.\n\nMr. Sessions, 69, was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump in February, when many Republicans were still shunning the businessman. He has since become a close adviser.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Sessions has served for years and sometimes clashed with fellow members, will consider his nomination. Democrats are eager to interrogate him on the rockier patches of his long career, particularly the accusations of racially charged comments in the 1980s that derailed his nomination as a federal judge.\n\nCritics charge that the controversy was a harbinger of hostility toward minorities that has continued in his two decades as a senator.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most strident anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-L.G.B.T. voices in the Senate,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way, a liberal civil rights group in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sessions, like Mr. Trump, has made tougher immigration policies a central priority. He has said President Obama\u2019s Justice Department flouted the will of Congress by failing to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhen many Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s startling campaign proposal to ban Muslim immigration, Mr. Sessions said he was open to considering it in a Breitbart interview last December with Stephen K. Bannon, who was chosen by Mr. Trump this week as a top White House adviser.\n\nMr. Sessions acknowledged in the interview that the proposal was \u201ctreading on dangerous ground\u201d because of the country\u2019s long history of religious freedom.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re in an age that\u2019s very dangerous, and we\u2019re seeing more and more persons enter, and a lot of them have done terrorist acts, and a lot of them believe it\u2019s commanded by their religion,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s appropriate to begin to discuss this.\u201d\n\nAs the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions, and the political appointees under him, would hold wide discretion in shaping policies across the federal government and in overseeing the enforcement of federal laws at the F.B.I. and other agencies within the Justice Department.\n\nHis department would also play an important role in advising the White House on Supreme Court nominees and working to get them confirmed in the Senate. Mr. Sessions, an avid student of constitutional history, has called Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, a model, hailing him for \u201can unwavering commitment to the rule of law\u201d rather than judicial activism.\n\nMr. Sessions was born in Selma, Ala., the son of a country store owner. The diminutive Mr. Sessions was an Eagle Scout known as \u201cBuddy\u201d as a child. His parents, he said, instilled in him the values of \u201chonesty, hard work, belief in God and parental respect.\u201d\n\nWith a law degree from the University of Alabama, Mr. Sessions worked as a private attorney and as an assistant federal prosecutor before President Ronald Reagan tapped him in 1981 as the United States attorney for the southern district of Alabama. He held that post for 12 years.\n\nAccusations of inappropriate racial remarks \u2014 one black prosecutor said Mr. Sessions called him \u201cboy,\u201d and another prosecutor said he referred to groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union as \u201cun-American\u201d \u2014 doomed his nomination for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench in 1986.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Sessions took satisfaction not only in winning election to the Senate a decade later, but also in earning a seat on the powerful Judiciary Committee, the same panel that had rejected his nomination as a judge.", "publish_date": "2016-11-19", "authors": "Eric Lichtblau", "type": "article"}
