Let us know.\n\n_________\n\nWarm Up\n\nAsk students: What have you heard, if anything, about the executive order President Trump signed on Jan. 27 concerning U.S. immigration policy? After a few students share, watch the above video providing background on the executive order, reporting on protests against the new policy and raising questions about its legality. Follow up by asking: What reactions do you have to the video? What questions does it raise for you?\n\nAt this point, you may want to provide additional context for students with this article, \u201cTrump\u2019s Executive Order on Immigration: What We Know and What We Don\u2019t,\u201d before proceeding with the activity.\n\nActivity\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order fits into a larger pattern of U.S. history. In 1882, Congress excluded Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. Later it prohibited almost all Japanese immigrants. And still later it gave preference to immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, making it difficult for people from other parts of the world to immigrate to the U.S. But the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 changed all of that. It did away with the national origins quota and banned discrimination based on where a person was from.\n\nHowever, with Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncement on Jan. 27, the U.S. once again excludes immigrants based on national origin from countries like Iraq, Yemen and Sudan.\n\nThis activity invites students to analyze Mr. Trump\u2019s stated purpose for his executive order (as explained within Section 1 of the text), then consider three pieces in The Times that question its effectiveness, legality and interpretation of American values.\n\nWorking in three different groups, students should read and annotate the excerpts below (or the full texts) and answer the relevant question through writing and discussion. Then, the class can come back together to share what they learned.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe have reproduced the readings for the three groups in this PDF.\n\nAs a follow-up activity, we point to an article in the conservative magazine National Review which largely supports Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. Students can annotate and read this article, and then hold a debate about whether or not Mr. Trump\u2019s policy is good for the country.\n\n_________\n\nGroup One: Is the executive order good public policy: Will it help prevent future terrorist acts, its stated purpose?\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump states in the executive order:\n\nNumerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\n\nIn \u201cImmigration Ban Is Unlikely to Reduce Terrorist Threat, Experts Say,\u201d Scott Shane investigates whether the executive order is likely to accomplish its stated goal:\n\nRarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday: \u201cProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.\u201d But the president\u2019s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States, which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001. Many experts believe the order\u2019s unintended consequences will make the threat worse. While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence, terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data. For instance, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the seven countries targeted in the order\u2019s 120-day visa ban, according to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina. Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind \u2014 for instance, charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group \u2014 only 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries, said Mr. Kurzman, who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism. The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States, and the president\u2019s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame. There was a random quality to the list of countries: It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated. Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan, where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States. Notably, perhaps, the list avoided Muslim countries where Mr. Trump has major business ventures.\n\n_________\n\nGroup Two: Is the executive order legal?\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an Op-Ed, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, puts Mr. Trump\u2019s policy into historical context and makes the case that it is illegal. He argues that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. The Op-Ed begins:\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order on Friday that purports to bar for at least 90 days almost all permanent immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries, including Syria and Iraq, and asserts the power to extend the ban indefinitely. But the order is illegal. More than 50 years ago, Congress outlawed such discrimination against immigrants based on national origin. That decision came after a long and shameful history in this country of barring immigrants based on where they came from. Starting in the late 19th century, laws excluded all Chinese, almost all Japanese, then all Asians in the so-called Asiatic Barred Zone. Finally, in 1924, Congress created a comprehensive \u201cnational-origins system,\u201d skewing immigration quotas to benefit Western Europeans and to exclude most Eastern Europeans, almost all Asians, and Africans. Mr. Trump appears to want to reinstate a new type of Asiatic Barred Zone by executive order, but there is just one problem: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin, replacing the old prejudicial system and giving each country an equal shot at the quotas. In signing the new law, President Lyndon B. Johnson said that \u201cthe harsh injustice\u201d of the national-origins quota system had been \u201cabolished.\u201d Nonetheless, Mr. Trump asserts that he still has the power to discriminate, pointing to a 1952 law that allows the president the ability to \u201csuspend the entry\u201d of \u201cany class of aliens\u201d that he finds are detrimental to the interest of the United States. But the president ignores the fact that Congress then restricted this power in 1965, stating plainly that no person could be \u201cdiscriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d The only exceptions are those provided for by Congress (such as the preference for Cuban asylum seekers).\n\n_________\n\nGroup Three: Does the president\u2019s executive order uphold the values of the United States?\n\nMr. Trump states in the executive order:\n\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argues in an Op-Ed that rather than upholding America\u2019s founding principles, Mr. Trump is actually subverting them. He writes:\n\nThis is a country built by refugees and immigrants, your ancestors and mine. When we bar them and vilify them, we shame our own roots.\n\nHis Op-Ed begins:\n\nThis newspaper has periodically, to its shame, succumbed to the kind of xenophobic fearmongering that President Trump is now trying to make American policy. In 1875, The Times sternly warned that too many Irish and German immigrants (like the Trumps) could \u201cdeprive Americans by birth and descent of the small share they yet retain\u201d in New York City. In 1941, The Times cautioned in a front-page article that European Jews desperately seeking American visas might be Nazi spies. In 1942, as Japanese-Americans were being interned, The Times cheerfully suggested that the detainees were happily undertaking an \u201cadventure.\u201d We make bad decisions when we fear immigrants we \u201cotherize.\u201d That\u2019s why Americans burned Irish Catholics alive, banned Chinese for decades, denied visas to Anne Frank\u2019s family and interned Japanese-Americans. And yes, The New York Times sometimes participated in such madness. But we will not be part of that today. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that suspends refugee programs and targets Muslims from certain countries. It\u2019s hypocritical for Trump to be today\u2019s avatar of hostility to immigrants, since his own family suffered from anti-German sentiment and pretended to be Swedish.\n\n_________\n\nFollow-Up Activity\n\nPhoto\n\nThe reaction to President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees entering the United States was swift, certain \u2014 and sharply divided.\n\nWhile the first activity asked student groups to read three articles that questioned the effectiveness, legality and spirit of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, there were also voices of support from various corners of the U.S. and the world.\n\nIn \u201cTrump\u2019s Immigration Ban Draws Deep Anger and Muted Praise,\u201d Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a writes:\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically. Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president\u2019s more narrowly tailored order as common sense. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-American. I think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201d Kathleen Ganci, 67, whose husband, Peter J. Ganci Jr., the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order, too. \u201cI don\u2019t care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want other Americans to go through what I did \u2014 because we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.\u201d And Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration, said it makes sense to suspend the refugee program temporarily, examine it, \u201cand at least begin to initiate some changes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what form those changes will take, and I\u2019m not sure the administration knows yet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an article from the conservative magazine National Review headlined \u201cTrump\u2019s Executive Order on Refugees \u2014 Separating Fact from Hysteria,\u201d David French argues that the administration\u2019s new immigration policy is, for the most part, \u201creasonable and prudent.\u201d He writes:\n\nTo the extent this ban applies to new immigrant and non-immigrant entry, this temporary halt (with exceptions) is wise. We know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks of refugees and other visitors. We know that immigrants from Somalia, for example, have launched jihadist attacks here at home and have sought to leave the U.S. to join ISIS.\n\nStudents can read the details of Mr. French\u2019s argument, and then hold a class debate or discussion about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban is good policy.\n\n_________\n\nMore from The Learning Network\n\nPhoto\n\nLesson Plan | Text to Text: Comparing Jewish Refugees of the 1930s With Syrian Refugees Today\n\nStudent Opinion Question | What Is Your Reaction to the First Days of the Trump Presidency?\n\nArticle of the Day, Jan. 30, 2017 | \u201cWelcome to the New World\u201d\n\nLesson Plan | The Inauguration of a New President: A Lesson Plan on Predicting and Evaluating the First 100 Days of a Trump White House\n\nLesson Plan | Border Challenges: Responding to the Global Migration Crisis\n\nUpdate, Jan. 31: A post from our colleagues at Facing History and Ourselves: 3 Ways to Address the Latest News on Immigration With Your Students", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Michael Gonchar and Katherine Schulten", "type": "article"}
