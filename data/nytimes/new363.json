Katyal, a lawyer for Hawaii, which is challenging the revised order, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign website until very recently continued to feature a 2015 news release that said \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d\n\nThat document, Mr. Katyal said, \u201cjust happened to disappear moments before the Fourth Circuit argument last week.\u201d\n\nOn May 8, a 13-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., heard arguments in a separate appeal of an order blocking part of the revised travel ban, that one from a federal judge in Maryland.\n\nJudge Richard A. Paez asked Mr. Katyal whether Mr. Trump \u201cis forever barred from issuing an executive order along these lines.\u201d\n\nMr. Katyal responded that a revised order might be proper if Congress enacted new legislation authorizing it, if Mr. Trump explicitly disavowed his earlier statements or if he described Islam in the positive terms that President George W. Bush used after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The role of the courts, he said, was limited to determining whether the government had a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d for taking action.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLate in the argument, Judge Hawkins asked Mr. Katyal, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be deferential to the office of president of the United States on these issues?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Mr. Katyal said \u2014 and he added that the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion supplied the answer.\n\n\u201cIs this executive order, viewed from the standpoint of an objective observer, an establishment of a disfavored religion, Islam?\u201d Mr. Katyal asked. The answer, he said, was yes.\n\nMr. Trump issued his initial order on Jan. 27, a week into his presidency. Less than two weeks later, a different three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed an order halting it.\n\nWithin minutes of the ruling, Mr. Trump vowed to fight it. \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut the president did not appeal to the Supreme Court. Instead, he issued a revised executive order.\n\nThe new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. It omitted Iraq, which had been listed in the earlier order, and it removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. And it deleted explicit references to religion. Like the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 120,000.\n\nHawaii sued to challenge the revised executive order, saying it was the product of religious hostility. On March 15, Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, blocked major parts of the revised order, saying they violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion. Judge Watson wrote that the statements of Mr. Trump and his advisers made clear that his executive order amounted to an attempt to treat Muslims with disfavor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA reasonable, objective observer \u2014 enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance \u2014 would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion,\u201d Judge Watson wrote.\n\nMuch of Monday\u2019s argument concerned how to reconcile two parts of the immigration laws.\n\nOne provision allows the president to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\u201d if he determines that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut another provision appears to limit that power, saying that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d\n\nMr. Wall said the second provision would at most require the issuance of visas to people who could nonetheless still be barred at the border.\n\nJudge Hawkins said that \u201cwould be like Tom Hanks at the airport,\u201d apparently referring to \u201cThe Terminal,\u201d a 2004 film about a man stranded at Kennedy Airport.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "mr", "judges", "revised", "trump", "ban", "katyal", "judge", "faces", "united", "trumps", "religion", "order", "president", "weigh", "poker"], "summary": "\u201cIs this executive order, viewed from the standpoint of an objective observer, an establishment of a disfavored religion, Islam?\u201d Mr. Katyal asked.\nWithin minutes of the ruling, Mr. Trump vowed to fight it.\n\u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.\nInstead, he issued a revised executive order.\nHawaii sued to challenge the revised executive order, saying it was the product of religious hostility."}
