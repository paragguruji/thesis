They called them \u201cunilateral edicts\u201d and \u201cpower grabs.\u201d As Iowa Senator Charles Grassley once said in a floor speech: \u201cThe president looks more and more like a king that the Constitution was designed to replace.\u201d\n\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nNow many of those Republicans are as quiet as church mice as Donald Trump pumps out executive orders at a fevered pitch, doing exactly what he said he\u2019d do during the campaign, for all of those who were paying attention: advancing a white nationalist agenda and vision of America, whether that be by demonizing blacks in the \u201cinner city,\u201d Mexicans at the border or Muslims from the Middle East.\n\nTrump\u2019s America is not America: not today\u2019s or tomorrow\u2019s, but yesterday\u2019s.\n\nTrump\u2019s America is brutal, perverse, regressive, insular and afraid. There is no hope in it; there is no light in it. It is a vast expanse of darkness and desolation.\n\nAnd that is a vision of America that most of the people in this country cannot and will not abide. That is a vision of America that has galvanized ordinary American citizens in opposition in a way that is almost without precedent. We are inching toward anarchy as both the people and the president refuse to back down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot only is Trump a literacy-lite, conspiracy-chasing, compulsively lying bigot, he is also a narcissistic workaholic who now wields the power of the presidency. You could not have conceived of a more dangerous combination of characteristics. He is the paragon of the clueless and an idol of the Ku Kluxers. Already, people feel deluged by a never-ending flood of national damage and despair. But Americans are not prone to suffering in silence. America\u2019s period of mourning has ended; the time of anger and active opposition has dawned. The greatest two motivators of electoral activism in this country are a desire for change and durable fear: In Trump, those two are wed.", "authors": ["Charles M.
