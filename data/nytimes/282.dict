The gunman reportedly yelled \u201cget out of my country\u201d before killing Ms. Dumala\u2019s husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, as he was having a glass of whiskey after work with a friend, who was wounded.\n\nPresident Trump and his administration have not only tried to keep many immigrants and foreign visitors out of the country, they have done so by casting them as criminals, potential terrorists and trespassers, out to steal the jobs and threaten the lives of Americans.\n\nMs. Dumala and millions of other members of minorities are integral to the United States, which is almost entirely made up of immigrants and their descendants. But this history might not comfort marginalized groups who hear the administration\u2019s words and see what is happening in this country and wonder if it is safe to stay here, or come here.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Hate crimes and other incidents of bias have flared up, as documented by many news organizations. Mr. Kuchibhotla\u2019s murder is one end of a continuum of hate. Elsewhere, people have defiled or threatened violence at Jewish cemeteries and synagogues.", "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
