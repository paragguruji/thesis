His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today.\n\nWhile embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russian government backed the Kadyrov family\u2019s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say.\n\nStill, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia.\n\n\u201cPutin rules a multiconfessional country,\u201d Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. \u201cHe cannot say \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 for a simple reason. He doesn\u2019t want to alienate millions of Russians.\u201d\n\nThe term preferred in Russian political parlance is \u201cinternational terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn a phone call on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin discussed \u201creal cooperation\u201d in fighting terrorist groups in Syria. They could agree on an enemy. But the Kremlin statement described a \u201cpriority placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat \u2014 international terrorism.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Andrew E.
