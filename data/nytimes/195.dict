We need to fight back. We need to demand different policies. Together, we can prove that it\u2019s not about the power of the government, but the power of the people that can make a change.\n\nJENAN A. MATARI\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is co-founder and editor in chief of the website MissMuslim.\n\nReaders React\n\nThe letter by Ms. Matari will convince few if any of her detractors that a broad-based distrust of Islam as a religion is wrong and should be separated from a fear of Islamist-inspired terrorism. She never seems to admit that there is any basis for that fear, or that aspects of her religion as increasingly practiced in many Muslim-majority countries, and occasionally called for by some in Islamic communities here, represent a frightening step backward in human history and our respect for basic human rights.\n\nI distrust all of the major religions when practiced to an extreme and when they attempt to meddle in politics, but adherents of no other religion attacked this country in the name of their religion in order to provoke a holy war. While it remains a fact that a citizen of this country is many more times likely to be killed violently by other non-Muslim citizens, or even by being run over by a cab, the constant threat of violence from Islamist extremists is real, and not likely to end any time soon.\n\nWe absolutely have a long, shameful and continuing history of prejudice; as the offspring of Czarist Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, during the Cold War I experienced the ridiculous distrust of many here toward people perceived as a threat. I also recognize that the vast majority of Muslim-Americans simply want to be left in peace. But while non-Muslims need to look at ourselves, Muslims do, too. To counter prejudice there must be wider acknowledgment within your community that the threat is real, and there must be a more visible attempt to make it clear that Muslim-Americans do not adhere to the worst practices of their religion.\n\nVALENTIN K. GRIBKOFF\n\nWatertown, Mass.\n\nI don\u2019t think much about my Muslim self. I occupy my life thinking about myself as a doctor, husband, father, son, friend and neighbor. Nonetheless, I am thoroughly Muslim. That is my identity. Society wants to hate the Muslim part of me. Not because it knows it, but rather because it doesn\u2019t understand it.\n\nThe stories in recent days are so heartbreaking: green cards surrendered, visas revoked, little children separated from their parents, abandoned Syrian refugees. Is the false sense of security worth imposing such suffering? I wish the thousands of patients I took care of in Louisiana for many years and who get their view of Muslims from Fox News knew that their doctor was Muslim. Maybe then, they wouldn\u2019t be so quick to judge. Once the labels fade into the background, most human beings realize they are not all that different from one another.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These are things of much more serious public health import. These do threaten the lives of Americans in a serious and meaningful way. We don\u2019t need a prejudiced ban. We just need Americans to talk to one another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUMER AHMAD\n\nBasking Ridge, N.J.\n\nNo doubt because I am old enough to have experienced \u2014 and participated in \u2014 civil rights and marriage equality struggles, I am confident that we can defeat Ms. Matari\u2019s enemies as long as we are patient, persistent and polite. Patience because it will take a while before Donald Trump\u2019s supporters realize that his policies will not fulfill his extravagant promises of safer and better times. Persistence because it will take repeated efforts to break through the like-minded friendships, Fox News and Twitter insults that Trump supporters use to create a self-defined world. Politeness because anger and insults from us liberals only reinforce the belief of Mr. Trump\u2019s base that he must be doing something right. Millions of us are with you, Ms. Matari. We will overcome.\n\nPETER K. FROST\n\nWilliamstown, Mass.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure I know what \u201cidentity politics\u201d means. As an adopted Asian-American who grew up in rural part of a mostly white state (Maine), I can\u2019t say I identify with anything other than myself. The way I vote is based on my convictions, not because I am Asian or grew up in a white family. This term gets thrown around so much by partisans on both sides that it has become meaningless. It is both a call to action and an accusation, a source of unity and a slur. So if someone could adequately define what \u201cidentity politics\u201d that encompasses all the ways that it gets used, I would be greatly appreciate it.\n\nSTEPHANIE HARRELL\n\nHillsborough, N.C.\n\nNo person should be subject to the harassment that Ms. Matari has described. But Ms. Matari should also realize that she, as a Muslim, is treated far better in the United States than Jews or Christians are in any Muslim-majority country. Perhaps, just perhaps, if Muslim countries practiced the toleration for other faiths that we have here and that Ms. Matari would want, Muslim-Americans would find themselves more courteously treated.\n\nALAN PEKELNER\n\nNew York\n\nDear Ms. Matari: I am one old woman who is ashamed to call myself an American since Donald Trump assumed the presidency. My heart hurts for what you are needlessly enduring. The blatant prejudice that has crawled out of the woodwork since his run for office has been horrifying. I thought maybe we had begun to evolve past such horrors.\n\nAll I can promise you is that this one little old lady will do everything I can to make it better. I will write letters, donate to causes, make calls, lobby, march in the streets. I will volunteer in any way I can to make America really great, which can happen only when we realize the beauty of diversity.\n\nI am so horrified and disgusted by the prejudice of former immigrants to our newer immigrants. We are all immigrants here \u2014 except Native Americans, and, ironically, they have dealt with horrific prejudice as well. So sad. So senseless.\n\nI wish that one old lady could make more of a difference.\n\nDALE KATZEN\n\nNew York\n\nThe Writer Responds\n\nThe chances of an American citizen falling victim to a terrorist attack on American soil by a foreigner is infinitesimal. Americans are much more likely to become victims of violence by white men with guns than by ISIS and its sympathizers. Mr. Gribkoff acknowledges the irrational fear of Muslims; if people would properly inform themselves about the true threats to American lives \u2014 which include our own health issues, as Dr. Ahmad stated \u2014 rather than play into the fear-mongering media, they would understand just how irrational their fear of Muslims is. Religion is not at fault; people who misinterpret its teachings are.\n\nWhile I, and many others like me, acknowledge the very real fear of Islamic extremists, fearing Islam in its entirety only perpetuates \u201cotherizing\u201d those who look, speak and pray differently than ourselves and causes more division among our citizens. We must acknowledge the \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims (true Muslims) who are speaking out against this violence and understand that we are risking our safety and our lives to do so.\n\nWe need to remain persistent and patient, as Mr. Frost says. We must instill in our children compassion, understanding and a genuine curiosity to learn. While the writers\u2019 responses have been enlightening and encouraging, I come out of this wonderful dialogue just wanting to give Ms. Katzen a big hug.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJENAN A.
