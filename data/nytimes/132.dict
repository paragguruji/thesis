The University of British Columbia announced the establishment of a task force, with an initial budget of 250,000 Canadian dollars (about $190,000), \u201cto determine what assistance the university can offer those affected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince the restrictions, some institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California system, have advised students or faculty members from Iran, Iraq and the other affected countries not to travel overseas until further notice.\n\nThe order could prevent many foreign researchers from making short-term trips to attend conferences and other scientific meetings overseas for fear of not being able to return. The restrictions could also affect meetings in the United States, as some foreign scientists would not be allowed to travel here.\n\nThe country\u2019s largest general scientific organization, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said it was worried that the restrictions might reduce attendance at its annual meeting in two weeks in Boston. Hundreds of foreigners normally attend the conference. \u201cWe are of course concerned that this issue may affect scientists and students traveling to Boston,\u201d said Tiffany Lohwater, an official with the association. She said the organization was considering alternative measures, including free live-streaming of sessions, for those who could not attend.\n\nJennifer Golbeck, a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, said her department had a number of Iranian students and researchers. Using social media, Dr. Golbeck in recent days has organized a database of people willing to shelter scientists and others who were in transit to the United States and were halted by the order.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people from these seven countries,\u201d Dr. Golbeck said. \u201cAnd suddenly there\u2019s this possibility that faculty members, students, postdocs and others who are outside the country for one reason or another suddenly can\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nSolmaz Shariat Torbaghan, an Iranian neuroscience researcher at New York University who was awaiting a green card, said the order would force her to soon make a decision: stay and take her chances, or move to Canada. \u201cMy partner and I just moved into a new place here, we are waiting for our furniture, and were hoping to have our parents visit us in a couple of months, which is not a possibility anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty, she added, is not good for her research colleagues, either. \u201cPeople in my lab are very supportive,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in an experimental lab, people need to know they can count on you, that you\u2019re not going to be suddenly gone and leave the project.\u201d\n\nThe order may also affect work at some of the country\u2019s most prestigious medical institutions.\n\nEleven patients from the seven affected countries, which also include Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, were planning to travel to Johns Hopkins University for medical treatment within the next 90 days, said Pamela Paulk, the president of Johns Hopkins Medicine International. All have visas, she said, but now it is not clear whether or when they may come.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\n\n\u201cWe are taking steps to see what the ban means for them,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now the ban is vague, and we don\u2019t know if there will be health exceptions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe said that patients who travel from the Middle East to the United States for treatment generally have severe illnesses that cannot be treated in their home countries, and need complex treatments like neurosurgery, heart operations or bone marrow transplants for cancer or blood diseases. Some cannot afford, medically, to wait.\n\nJohns Hopkins may also lose at least one graduate student. Omid Zobeiri, 28, is an Iranian citizen who began working on his doctorate in biomedical engineering in September 2015 at McGill University in Montreal. His mentor and supervisor at McGill moved to Johns Hopkins last summer and hoped to take Mr. Zobeiri with her so he could continue the research he had begun in her laboratory.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
