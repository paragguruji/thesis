An openly lesbian Protestant chaplain from the Fire Department helped to open the gathering along with an imam from the Police Department.\n\nMr. de Blasio spoke from a lectern adorned with a hashtag \u2014 #AlwaysNewYork \u2014 meant to inspire tales of solidarity and pride in New York values. He reminded the audience that Mr. Trump defended those values in abstract on the campaign trail during the Republican primary contests.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t changing,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, before listing his promises to defend New Yorkers from deportation, unconstitutional police practices and any cuts to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe will ensure women receive the health care they need.\u201d\n\nFormer city lawyers said the mayor could rely on the federalism of the Constitution as well as established case law to challenge undesired programs from Washington. It could be many more months, if not years, before the issues would be resolved in court.\n\n\u201cThere is important value in reassuring people that the city and the state maintain considerable sovereignty over its own policy,\u201d said Victor A. Kovner, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine and a former city corporation counsel.\n\nThe federal government may have broad authority over immigration, said Michael A. Cardozo, a partner at Proskauer who served as the corporation counsel under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican turned political independent. \u201cBut those laws do not give the federal government carte blanche to do whatever it wants with an immigrant.\u201d\n\nSince the presidential election provided a shock to residents in the city and in many areas of the state, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have offered similar messages, appealing to Mr. Trump\u2019s New York roots while also presenting themselves as defenders of their constituents who are worried about a new administration that neither of them supported during the campaign.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party, in a statement accused both of a \u201cnaked and unseemly fight\u201d to position themselves for a future presidential run.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese two scorpions in a bottle are each trying to outdo one another with slanderous fear-mongering hyperbole,\" he said.\n\nAsked about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s attempt to calm fearful New Yorkers, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, mocked the mayor to reporters outside Trump Tower: \u201cFearful of the jobs he\u2019s killed? Fearful of the bike lanes?\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was repeated in the response to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s hashtag, which for much of Monday provided a forum on Twitter for those opposed to his handling of the city to vent frustrations, as well as for supporters.\n\n\u201cMayor de Blasio rolled over for the N.Y.P.D. after they did a back-turning protest,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cYou think he won\u2019t roll over for Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud to be a New Yorker,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThey should both be impeached,\u201d another said of the mayor and the governor.\n\nEven with a shared antagonist in Mr. Trump, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have not been able to bridge the gap between them that, those close to both men say, has seemingly widened beyond repair. They have not held an event together since the election and have appeared content to go their own way in assuaging the concerns of New Yorkers, even as they end up finding very similar ways of doing so.\n\n\u201cWe will stand up and say, \u2018Yes we are black, white and brown \u2014 but we are one,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in his speech.\n\nMr. de Blasio said in his remarks the next day, \u201cTo all Latinos who heard their culture denigrated \u2014 we stand by you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes we are Christian, Muslim and Jews, but we are one,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cTo all the Muslims who have heard their faith belittled \u2014 we stand by you,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAnd that is the New York way,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cWe are always New York,\u201d Mr. de Blasio ended.", "authors": ["J.
