The American president, a prolific \u2014 and often contentious \u2014 user of Twitter, will also deliver the keynote address at a conference about social media, under the auspices of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king\u2019s powerful son.\n\nElsewhere in the city, there is to be an international counterterrorism conference, a forum for chief executives, an art exhibition inside the Royal Court and a concert featuring the American country musician Toby Keith. (In a kingdom where alcohol is banned, he is unlikely to entertain the all-male crowd with his song \u201cBeer for My Horses.\u201d)\n\n\u201cHistoric Summit. Brighter Future,\u201d an official website for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit declares.\n\nThe exuberant reception reflects the sharp contrast with how Persian Gulf leaders perceived Mr. Obama and his policies. He angered the Saudis for what they saw as his abandonment of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a longtime American ally, during the Arab Spring protests; his hesitation to intervene directly in the Syria conflict; and his pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cAny new president has to be better than President Obama, because no one was worse for us than Obama,\u201d said Salman al-Dossary, a writer for the Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They hope he will increase support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen against rebels aligned with Iran. And they see a role for American investment in efforts to shift the Saudi economy from its dependence on oil.\n\n\u201cThis administration is very clear, not just with Saudi Arabia but also with Turkey and other traditional allies, that the idea is to double down on existing relationships and to put allies first,\u201d said Mohammed Khalid Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a policy research organization.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also pitched itself as a Muslim ally against Islamic State militants, and Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to moderate his stance on Islam was among the reasons he chose Riyadh as his first stop overseas as president, according to administration officials.\n\nMr. Trump also hopes Arab states can play a role in brokering a deal between Israel and the Palestinians \u2014 an idea that some Persian Gulf leaders have privately entertained, if Israel were to offer certain concessions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure that have caused criticism in the United States do not seem to bother the Saudis.\n\nHis reliance on his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner \u2014 both of whom will join him in Riyadh \u2014 for policy advice is business as usual in a monarchy where princes run the government and the king has appointed one son as defense minister and another as ambassador to Washington.\n\nAnd worries that Mr. Trump could use his presidency to benefit Trump hotels and golf courses get little traction in a country that is named after its royal family, and where the line between public and private wealth is vague.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s apparent lack of interest in human rights also suggests that he is unlikely to complain about the justice system or the limited rights of Saudi women.\n\nBecause of their decades-old alliance, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for security and other issues. To maintain that alliance, Saudi leaders have studiously ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam while emphasizing what their kingdom provides, including intelligence cooperation and billions of dollars in arms purchases.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Trump has not always returned the love.\n\nLast month, he told Reuters that protecting Saudi Arabia cost too much. \u201cFrankly, Saudi Arabia has not treated us fairly, because we are losing a tremendous amount of money in defending Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile such comments made some Saudis uncomfortable, they took heart from his ordering the strike in Syria \u2014 a step that Mr. Obama had declined to take \u2014 and they hope his tough talk on Iran will lead to action.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the visit will result in concrete initiatives or will remain symbolic. But some caution that what Mr. Trump will ultimately give Persian Gulf states may fall short of the expectations.\n\n\u201cYou have a Trump administration that has a banner of \u2018America first\u2019 and is preparing a counterterrorism strategy that seeks to place the burden more so on the shoulders of our partners,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington research organization, who has recently met with senior Persian Gulf officials. \u201cTherein lies a potential for a mismatch of expectations.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-18", "authors": "Ben Hubbard", "type": "article"}
