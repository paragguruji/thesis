Mr. Aslan, an Iranian-American writer and religion scholar who hosts a weekly show about faith and society for CNN, also described Mr. Trump as \u201can embarrassment to humankind.\u201d\n\nThat prompted expressions of outrage from right-wing news outlets like Breitbart News and the hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Sunday morning, who lamented his comment. CNN was already mired in an uproar over the comedian Kathy Griffin, a co-host of the network\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve coverage, who posted a photograph in which she held a fake severed head meant to look like the president\u2019s; CNN severed ties with Ms. Griffin last week.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Critics pointed to the president\u2019s criticism of London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, noting that Mr. Trump had taken a quote from the mayor out of context to suggest that he was unconcerned about terrorism.\n\nThere was also some disbelief in online comments that the president, who has access to up-to-the-minute national intelligence, chose to send a speculative item from The Drudge Report to his 31.5 million Twitter followers on an issue of international import. The Drudge Report, which is hugely popular with conservatives, counts Mr. Trump among its devotees: @Drudge_Report is just one of 45 Twitter accounts that he follows.\n\nOn \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d a reliably Trump-friendly morning show, there was little concern over the president\u2019s tweets, but some criticism of Mr. Aslan\u2019s remark, which the hosts described as evidence of an explicit bias against Mr. Trump in some quarters of the news media.\n\nIt was not long until the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d crew was coping with its own troubles.\n\nOne of the show\u2019s guest commentators, Katie Hopkins of The Daily Mail, raised the prospect of rounding up Muslims on the terrror watch list in the United Kingdom and placing them in internment camps as a way of preventing future attacks. Another guest \u2014 Nigel Farage, the British political figure and \u201cBrexit\u201d advocate who is now a Fox News contributor \u2014 also mentioned the idea of internment.\n\nLater in the broadcast, the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d anchors paused for a formal denunciation of the statements, lest viewers be left with the impression that Fox was endorsing the idea.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the network, I think all of us here find that idea reprehensible here at Fox News Channel, just to be clear,\u201d a co-host, Clayton Morris, told viewers.\n\nMs. Huntsman added, \u201cIt\u2019s important to be said.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael M.
