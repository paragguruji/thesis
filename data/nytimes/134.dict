These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen.\u201d\n\nAmazon said it was aware of 49 employees out of its United States work force of 180,000 who are from one of the countries identified in the executive order, nearly all of whom hold citizenship in another country.\n\nSeven job candidates, all of them originally from Iran but citizens of other countries, have received employment offers from Amazon. The company is considering jobs for the candidates in other countries.\n\nIn an email to Amazon employees, the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company had expressed its opposition to the order to senior administration officials and congressional leaders. He said the company was exploring \u201cother legal options as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor tech leaders, it\u2019s a work force issue,\u201d said Michael Schutzler, the chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Association, a trade group representing the state\u2019s technology companies. \u201cWe have a huge shortage of talent. We create jobs 10 times faster than the state can produce talent. Reducing our ability to recruit talent to the state essentially concedes the field to our international competitors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTechnology companies are bracing for another executive order, expected to be signed by Mr. Trump soon, that could affect them further with changes to the system for issuing visas to foreign workers. Technology companies are big users of H-1Bs and other forms of visas for hiring engineers from overseas.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

Employees carried signs like \u201cTrump, Don\u2019t Be Evil\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley: Built by Immigrants,\u201d while others chanted \u201cNo Ban, No Wall\u201d into a megaphone.\n\nIt was a scene more fitting for a college campus than a gathering of employees at one of America\u2019s most valuable companies. Google offices in other cities like Seattle, San Francisco and New York held similar rallies. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, told employees at the rally that immigration was \u201ccore to the founding of this company.\u201d\n\nWhen the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who attended the protests at the San Francisco airport on Saturday, was introduced, the crowd broke into chants of \u201cSergey, Sergey, Sergey.\u201d Mr. Brin noted that he came to the United States as a 6-year-old refugee from the Soviet Union when nuclear tensions between the two countries were at their peak.\n\n\u201cEven then, the U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today or have any kind of life I have today if this wasn\u2019t a great country that stood up and spoke for liberty,\u201d Mr. Brin added.\n\nSoufi Esmaeilzadeh, a Google product manager who is an Iranian national with Canadian citizenship who resides in the United States with a green card, said that Google\u2019s immigration team initially recommended that she not return home from a business trip in Switzerland after the order was signed on Friday.\n\n\u201cMy life is in the U.S. I felt angry, scared, and honestly rejected,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel free or at peace.\u201d\n\nBut after the stay won by the American Civil Liberties Union, Google told her that she might have a small window to return but needed to leave immediately. Flying through Dublin, she said four immigration officers pored over her paperwork. She eventually arrived in San Francisco on Sunday.", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Nick Wingfield and Daisuke Wakabayashi", "type": "article"}
