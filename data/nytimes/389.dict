It has surpassed the U.S. as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. (The U.S. remains the biggest emitter over time.)\n\nHe notes that China has been investing in renewable energy and limiting coal use in the east to combat air pollution. And President Xi Jinping has promised that 20 percent of China\u2019s energy will come from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030.\n\nGovernment cleanup efforts, Mr. Wong says, are partly a result of growing public concern, occasionally expressed through angry online commentary.\n\nMr. Wong says the big question is how proactive China will be in setting ambitious climate commitments and pushing other nations to do the same.\n\n_____\n\nThis briefing was prepared for the European morning.
