Tillerson, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be secretary of state, parted ways with the president-elect on a range of issues this week, calling President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a regional and international threat who should be countered with \u201ca proportional show of force.\u201d Mr. Tillerson rejected a ban on Muslim immigrants, called the United States\u2019 commitment to NATO \u201cinviolable\u201d \u2014 again contradicting Mr. Trump \u2014 and said he did not agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s previous comments that Japan should perhaps obtain nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to head the C.I.A., Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, vigorously defended the intelligence agencies, which Mr. Trump has derided.\n\nTransition officials said they were unconcerned by the differences. Sean Spicer, who will be the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump had chosen people for their expertise, not their ability to parrot his own positions.\n\nStill, all signs indicate that the last word on policy will be Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cAt the end of the day, each one of them is going to pursue a Trump agenda and a Trump vision,\u201d Mr. Spicer told reporters Thursday morning.\n\nBut Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said the broad gulf between Mr. Trump and the nominees was unusual. \u201cIt suggests to me that Donald Trump wants advisers who will bring him different views,\u201d said Ms. Collins, a member of the Senate intelligence panel that grilled Mr. Pompeo on Thursday. \u201cThat would be very healthy. Or it could lead to confused messages both to our allies and our adversaries.\u201d\n\nDemocrats took a harsher view. \u201cA number of the nominees have tried to sprint away from the president-elect\u2019s out-of-the-mainstream positions to try to show the public they\u2019re reasonable,\u201d said Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The Trump team also recognizes that the president-elect\u2019s most unorthodox and belligerent stances \u2014 while helpful in a populist campaign for the White House \u2014 would be unlikely to pass muster with many members of the Senate, even fellow Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe nominees seem to be determined to create the impression that they could prevail in crucial policy discussions. \u201cI find it a strength that the president-elect has nominated people that have different views from the ones he has previously expressed,\u201d said John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees are being meticulously prepared for their meetings with senators and for confirmation hearings, several senators said. In those preparation sessions, the appointees are often questioned on issues they know could snag them.\n\nMost notably, the nominees have taken strong positions against Russia in the confirmation hearings. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has spent a year defending his desire to have strong relationships with Russia and Mr. Putin, and only this week seemed to acknowledge what the intelligence agencies agree on: that Russia interfered with the election.\n\nMr. Tillerson, in particular, was grilled on his views by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, given Mr. Tillerson\u2019s longstanding relationship with Mr. Putin as the head of Exxon Mobil, and his advocacy for dropping sanctions against the nation. On Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson said that Russia had been involved in the election hacking, though he did not go as far as Mr. Rubio seemed to want, by declaring Russia a rogue nation.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nMr. Mattis was uncompromising on the topic. \u201cSince Yalta, we have a long list of times we\u2019ve tried to engage positively with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a relatively short list of successes in that regard. And I think right now, the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with, with Mr. Putin, and we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and that we take the steps, the integrated steps, diplomatic, economic and military and the alliance steps, the working with our allies, to defend ourselves where we must.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillerson told lawmakers that he favored remaining a party to the global climate accord reached in Paris in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table with the conversations around how to deal with the threats of climate change,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\n\nIt is not clear whether he will get that chance. Though Mr. Trump told The New York Times last month that he had an \u201copen mind\u201d on the Paris Agreement, he promised in a speech last May that \u201cwe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\u201d\n\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s central campaign promises \u2014 to build \u201ca big, fat beautiful wall\u201d between the United States and Mexico \u2014 also fell flat this week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJohn F. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who is the nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, told Senate committee members that \u201ca physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job,\u201d adding, \u201cit has to be really a layered defense.\u201d\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, did not go as far on torture as Mr. Pompeo, who, when asked if he would allow the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d if ordered to do so by Mr. Trump, replied, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d But Mr. Sessions did say that waterboarding was illegal.\n\nOn Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants, Mr. Sessions said, \u201cI have no belief, and I do not support the idea that Muslims, as a religious group, should be denied admission to the United States.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-12", "authors": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "type": "article"}
