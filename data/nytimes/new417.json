Quoting from the decision that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage \u2014 Obergefell v. Hodges, decided two years earlier to the day \u2014 the justices\u2019 unsigned opinion declared that \u201cthe Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage \u2018on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples,\u2019 \u201d and noted that the Obergefell decision itself named birth and death certificates as among the rights and benefits of marriage \u201cto which same-sex couples, no less than opposite-sex couples, must have access.\u201d\n\nMost often these days, the Supreme Court uses the device of the unsigned \u201cper curiam\u201d opinion, meaning \u201cby the court,\u201d when a lower court grants habeas corpus to a criminal defendant and a majority of justices finds the error so clear as to warrant summary reversal without the need for full briefing and argument. The decision in the Arkansas case was a per curiam ruling that Chief Justice Roberts, a vigorous dissenter from the Obergefell decision, may or may not have joined; as Joshua Matz pointed out on the Take Care blog, it\u2019s not always the case that justices who dissent from an anonymous per curiam ruling identify themselves.\n\nThree dissenting justices did identify themselves: Justice Thomas, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Justice Gorsuch, who wrote for the three. What the majority found to have been obvious in the Obergefell decision \u2014 in which all current members of the court but Justice Gorsuch participated \u2014 he found lacking. \u201cNothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question,\u201d he wrote. The parenthetical \u201c(let alone clearly)\u201d either was or was not a sly dig at Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion in the marriage case: It has been widely criticized, and not only on the right, for grandiloquence that outstripped rigorous constitutional analysis. In any event, Justice Gorsuch\u2019s five-paragraph opinion addressed itself solely to the way the court dealt with the Arkansas case. \u201cIt seems far from clear what here warrants the strong medicine of summary reversal,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBy sticking to the procedural issue, his opinion skirted, albeit barely, a declaration of his own view of the merits. This raises the question: Why write at all? If he wasn\u2019t willing to argue or even engage with the majority on the merits of what the right to same-sex marriage entails, why bother to dissent? It was, I think, an odd judicial game of show-and-don\u2019t-tell, a way to demonstrate his alliance with the court\u2019s right flank without speaking quotably to the hot-button social issue at hand.\n\nJustice Gorsuch showed no such diffidence in expressing his views on a case the court decided on the merits on the term\u2019s last day: Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, in which the court held that a state could not make churches ineligible for certain public grant programs (in this instance, a grant for using recycled tires as playground surfaces). Justice Gorsuch joined the majority opinion by Chief Justice Roberts except for one important footnote that appeared to limit significantly the scope of the decision. The chief justice\u2019s footnote said: \u201cThis case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Assuming Justice Gorsuch realizes that compromises of this sort are the stuff of life on a multi-member court, did he really need to call the chief justice out on it with his patronizing public reminder about how the Supreme Court articulates \u201cgeneral principles\u201d? Did he think the chief justice didn\u2019t know that already? Or perhaps he just wanted to underscore the strong suggestion in his separate opinion that he interprets the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise clause as the Supreme Court never has, to entitle churches to public money on the same basis as secular institutions, even if the money will be put directly to religious uses (read, parochial school support).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was also on the receiving end of a public lecture by her new colleague. The case was a particularly obscure one, concerning how particular rulings of a federal agency are to be appealed by federal Civil Service employees. Six justices agreed with Justice Ginsburg that the proper venue was Federal District Court. That\u2019s not precisely how the statute reads, Justice Ginsburg acknowledged, but it was \u201cthe more sensible reading\u201d that avoided making courts wrestle with an \u201cunworkable\u201d distinction between the two types of cases at issue.\n\nOh, no, said Justice Gorsuch in dissent. \u201cIf a statute needs repair, there\u2019s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it. It\u2019s called legislation.\u201d He went on: \u201cTo be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real and the process can be protracted. But the difficulty of making new laws isn\u2019t some bug in the constitutional design: it\u2019s the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.\u201d\n\nReally? The effort by seven Supreme Court justices to make sense of an impossibly complex statute rather than throw up their hands is a threat to \u201cliberty\u201d? Those same justices, including the chief justice of the United States, needed a lesson in how a bill becomes a law? This case, argued on the morning of April 17, happened to be the very first case Neil Gorsuch heard as a Supreme Court justice. He dominated the first half of the argument, pounding away at Christopher Landau, an experienced member of the Supreme Court bar who eventually won the case. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking the court to break any new ground,\u201d Mr. Landau said at one point. \u201cNo, just to continue to make it up,\u201d was Justice Gorsuch\u2019s response from the bench.\n\nJustice Thomas joined Justice Gorsuch\u2019s dissenting opinion. And Justice Gorsuch joined an opinion by Justice Thomas, dissenting from the court\u2019s refusal to hear a challenge to California\u2019s restrictions on the concealed carrying of firearms. In their dissenting opinion, the two called \u201cindefensible\u201d the lower court\u2019s decision to uphold the statute, and they said the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to take up any gun cases for the past seven years was \u201cinexcusable.\u201d\n\nMore consequential was Justice Gorsuch\u2019s vote with Justice Thomas\u2019s separate opinion in dissent from the court\u2019s interim ruling on the Trump administration\u2019s Muslim travel ban. The majority, in an unsigned opinion, allowed the ban to apply for the time being only to people from the six affected Muslim-majority countries who lack a \u201cbona fide connection\u201d to the United States. Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch would have lifted a lower court\u2019s injunction in its entirety, permitting the travel ban to apply to all residents of the six countries.\n\nThe opinion that Justice Gorsuch signed contained an odd line: \u201cI agree with the court\u2019s implication that the government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d In fact, the implication from the majority\u2019s refusal to leave the injunction in place only for those who were most unlikely to get visas to enter the United States even without the travel ban is exactly the opposite.\n\nAnd there was a further oddity. Typically when a dissenting opinion refers to something in the majority opinion, the dissenting justice includes a citation to the point at issue. But in the Thomas opinion, there was no citation to a place in the majority opinion where the pro-government \u201cimplication\u201d could be found. Indeed, there could not have been a citation because there was no such implication. Although the majority opinion was unsigned, it\u2019s safe to assume that Chief Justice Roberts joined it; certainly, he would have spoken if he thought the court was set on the wrong course.\n\nAfter the term ended, voices on the right predictably cheered Justice Gorsuch\u2019s performance. \u201cGorsuch proves a solid conservative on court\u2019s final day,\u201d read a statement from the Committee for Justice, a strong supporter of his nomination. The right has reason to cheer, of course, but also reason to be wary when the new kid on the block overplays his hand. Early in Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s tenure, he lashed out at Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor for refusing to join him in voting to overturn Roe v. Wade when the opportunity presented itself in the 1989 Webster case. In his opinion in that case, he called his senior colleague\u2019s position \u201cirrational\u201d and said she \u201ccannot be taken seriously.\u201d If Justice Scalia thought that he would persuade Justice O\u2019Connor by belittling her, he placed a bad bet; three years later, she voted with the 5 to 4 majority to uphold the right to abortion.\n\nAnd while liberals have every reason to gnash their teeth over the justice who holds the seat that should have been Merrick Garland\u2019s, they can perhaps take some comfort in the unexpected daylight that has opened between him and two of the court\u2019s other conservatives, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy. My concern when Justice Gorsuch joined the court was how like Chief Justice Roberts he seemed in demeanor and professional trajectory. I could see him as a natural ally who would bolster the chief justice\u2019s most conservative instincts. It now seems just as likely that Neil Gorsuch\u2019s main effect on John Roberts will be to get on his nerves.", "authors": ["Linda Greenhouse"], "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["avatar", "case", "courts", "judicial", "majority", "supreme", "court", "opinion", "trumps", "gorsuch", "chief", "justice", "lifetenured", "justices"], "summary": "A majority of the Supreme Court agreed, overturning a contrary ruling by the Arkansas Supreme Court.\nThree dissenting justices did identify themselves: Justice Thomas, Justice Samuel A.
