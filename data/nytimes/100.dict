{"title": "In Canada, Justin Trudeau Says Refugees Are Welcome", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/world/canada/justin-trudeau-trump-refugee-ban.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cThe prime minister is looking forward to discussing the success of Canada\u2019s immigration and refugee policies with the president when they next speak,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said.\n\nAny move by Canada to quickly offer asylum to refugees frozen out of the United States would certainly pose logistical problems. And it seems unlikely that the government would put such refugees ahead of a long line of claimants who have already been told they will be allowed into Canada.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order is not only at odds with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s policies, but it also does not reflect the general sentiment in Canada, where the Syrian refugee program enjoys widespread support. About 16,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived since November have been wholly or partly sponsored by individual Canadians or groups that have come together to raise sponsorship funds. During Mr. Trudeau\u2019s current cross-country tour, the chief complaint about immigration has been that refugees are not arriving as quickly as would-be sponsors would like.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s social media posts may have been primarily aimed at a Canadian audience. He has been taken to task by some Canadians on social media and during his road show for not strongly attacking Mr. Trump\u2019s past remarks on women and his policies, both proposed or already implemented, that conflict with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political agenda.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He offers instead only pat answers about the importance of Canada\u2019s relationship to the United States and his government\u2019s desire to have a constructive relationship with the American administration. While attacking the president might be popular among Mr. Trudeau\u2019s supporters, the government believes it could have harmful and unproductive consequences.\n\nTwo members of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet came to Canada as refugees and were born in the predominately Muslim countries now targeted in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. They include Ahmed Hussen, the immigration minister, who was born in Somalia.\n\nThe immediate effect of the executive order within Canada was muted. Major Canadian airlines are not allowing people holding citizenship from the seven countries covered by the presidential action to board flights to the United States. But WestJet, a major carrier with several flights to America, said that by Saturday afternoon it had turned away only one passenger.\n\nIt is unknown, however, how many people tried to enter the United States by automobile, only to be turned away, or who simply abandoned such travel plans.", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Ian Austen", "type": "article"}
