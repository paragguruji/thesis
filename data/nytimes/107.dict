One woman, a visual artist from Yemen who is working in the United States on a green card, held a sign that read, \u201cI spit in Trump\u2019s hummus\u201d and wore a red, white and blue scarf around her head. \u2014 NICHOLAS FANDOS\n\n\u2022 Boston: A young woman in Copley Square held a sign that read: \u201cDear Donald. Me again. Marching for my immigrant husband and my Muslim friends. Back off! Claire.\u201d Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, issued a statement saying that he was discussing with members of the academic, medical and research sectors here how to minimize the risks that a ban on immigrants and refugees posed to their institutions. \u2014 KATHARINE Q. SEELYE\n\n\u2022 San Francisco: Lawyers stood in the international arrivals terminal of the airport offering free assistance to those awaiting detained family members. Several thousand protesters accompanied by a brass band and drummers paraded past check-in counters, chanting, \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!\u201d \u2013 THOMAS FULLER\n\n\u2022 Dallas: Hundreds of protesters at a Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport terminal passed around pizza and cookies, while children bent over poster boards and markers on the floor, making signs. Lawyers said that nine people from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria were still detained at midday, and that those being held had immigrant or tourist visas. \u2014 PATRICK McGEE\n\n\u2022 Phoenix: Outside Terminal 4, the busiest at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Syma Hamidi and Seemee Siddiqi, Muslim immigrants from Pakistan who work as doctors in Phoenix, wore a hijab to make a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually use this,\u201d Dr. Hamidi said, tugging at a black-and-white scarf. \u201cWe have it on because we want to make clear that we\u2019re here, and that the country we love is a country that accepts us all.\u201d They joined a few hundred protesters at the airport in Arizona. \u2014 FERNANDA SANTOS\n\n\u2022 Detroit: At least 2,000 people rallied outside of Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Sunday, according to some crowd estimates. Many could be heard chanting, \u201cNo ban no wall,\u201d \u201cNo hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here\u201d and \u201cU.S.A.\u201d Some said they were children of refugees, while others said they wanted to support their Muslim neighbors and friends. \u2014 SHABINA KHATRI\n\nVideo\n\nTrump: Ban is \u2018not about religion,\u2019 but safety\n\nPresident Trump issued a statement defending the travel ban at 4:30 p.m., saying that it was not a ban on Muslims and was not about religion, but was about \u201cterror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\nThe ban, he said, was similar to action taken by President Obama in 2011 when visas for Iraqi refugees \u2014 even those who risked their lives to help the American war effort \u2014 were all but halted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere is full text of President Trump\u2019s statement:\n\nAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\n\nPriebus says those with green cards will not be turned away\n\nReince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, seemed to soften the president\u2019s immigration order on Sunday, saying that people who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States, even if they are from one of the seven mostly Muslim countries covered by the new travel ban.\n\nEven so, Mr. Priebus said that border agents had \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries.\n\nOn Sunday, many travelers remained detained. Federal judges in four states have issued orders halting provisions of the ban.\n\nTrump calls McCain and Graham \u2018sadly weak\u2019 for criticizing ban\n\nPresident Trump struck back on Twitter at two leading Republican Senators who criticized the travel ban.\n\n\u201cSadly weak on immigration,\u201d the president said of Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had written that they feared the ban \u201cwill become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe senators expressed concern that the executive order \u201cmay do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d The president countered that they should focus on fighting ISIS \u201cinstead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats to protest on Monday\n\nDemocratic members of the House and the Senate will gather on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday evening to protest the travel ban, Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s action is not only unconstitutional but immoral,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nNew York governor vows legal assistance for detainees\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that his office would offer legal help to those detained at airports in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have directed the Port Authority and my counsel\u2019s office to make sure we are protecting the legal rights of any person detained at any of our airports, period,\u201d the governor, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cWe will serve as counsel for any detainee who needs legal assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates Kennedy and La Guardia Airports.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome detainees at airports are released\n\nTravelers being held at airports around the country continued to be released on Sunday, while some had already been sent back and others were not allowed onto their flights to the United States.\n\nThe number of people still in custody at Kennedy Airport was a floating target on Sunday night. Rep. Joe Crowley, a Queens Democrat, said that based on his meeting with a Customs and Border Protection agent that concluded at around 8 p.m., six people were still being held at the airport\u2019s Terminal 1.\n\nAll six have green cards, he said, and will be processed and released under terms of the judicial stay within a few hours. Five of the six are from a single flight from Turkey. Crowley said he did not know the flight on which the sixth arrived.\n\nCrowley called the executive order \u201chorrible and immoral.\u201d\n\nBut a lawyer organizing aid for detainees and their families said that as many as 52 people had been detained at the airport over the weekend, based on contact with families and other sources. As many as 20 were still detained and two had been deported as of Sunday evening, she said. \u2014 SEAN PICCOLI\n\nYassin Abdelrhman, 76, was embraced by his son, Mohammed Suliman, 37, at Kennedy Airport to cheers from onlookers that included a scrum of pro bono lawyers on Sunday. Mr. Suliman, a British citizen, had traveled to Sudan to bring his father to the United States. But while Mr. Suliman was allowed to enter the country, his father had been detained since 8 a.m. on Saturday. \u201cI am so tired,\u201d Mr. Suliman said. \u201cIt has been a long journey.\u201d His father did not speak. \u2014 RUTH BASHINSKY\n\nSamira Asgari, 30, an Iranian citizen who was scheduled to fly to Boston on Saturday morning to start a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School, was told in Frankfurt on Saturday that she could not board the plane. \u201cI was pretty excited to join @soumya_boston\u2019s lab but denied boarding due to my Iranian nationality,\u201d she posted on Twitter. \u201cFeeling safer?\u201d Dr. Asgari had recently completed her Ph.D. in Switzerland and was planning to study the genetic roots of why people respond differently to tuberculosis infections. \u2013 AMY HARMON\n\nIman Hussain, 50, was reunited with her two daughters, Elaf, 25, and Anfal, 23, at Kennedy Airport after being detained for more than 30 hours. Elaf Hussain said her mother, who lived in Baghdad, had applied for a green card two years ago and it finally came though on Jan. 16. \u2014 RUTH BASHINSKY\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVahideh Rasekhi, a Ph.D. student studying linguistics at Stony Brook University, hugged friends who greeted her as she walked out of Terminal 4 after being detained since flying into Kennedy Airport at 1:45 p.m. on Saturday from Iran. When asked if she felt angry being detained she said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel angry right now. I am so happy it\u2019s done.\u201d \u2014 RUTH BASHINSKY\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

He lived in Stockholm for more than a year while waiting for approval to come to America and join his wife, son and other relatives in the Houston area. \u2014 MANNY FERNANDEZ\n\nWitnesses say some airport detainees were handcuffed\n\nDetainees at Kennedy Airport were handcuffed as they were moved from one terminal to another and were essentially denied sustenance, a lawyer said.\n\nThe lawyer, Justin Orr, said the detainees were given only chocolate and caffeine on Saturday. Some groups supporting the detainees tried to send sandwiches and water, but the authorities refused to take them, Mr. Orr said.\n\nBut Ms. Rasekhi, the graduate student at Stony Brook University, said that food and water were provided. \u201cEven someone wanted lemon, just lemon water,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went and grabbed lemon. I don\u2019t know where they got the lemon from but they got it in like in two minutes.\u201d\n\nWitnesses described seeing detainees handcuffed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Seifollah Moradi, 34, an Iranian-American student from Columbia, Md., who has a green card and was held for six hours, said that he saw another Iranian man who had won a lottery visa handcuffed and taken away by customs officers who were moving people to an off-site detention center.\n\n\u201cThis is not the America that I have lived in,\u201d Mr. Moradi said. \u2013 RUTH BASHINSKY and MATTHEW ROSENBERG\n\nIn Georgia and New York, support for the ban\n\nNotwithstanding the protests across the country, many Americans strongly support the president\u2019s travel ban.\n\nBilly Bearden, who works in an auto-part factory in Carrollton, Ga., said he was \u201cglad and thankful\u201d that President Trump was making a \u201cserious effort to vet these individuals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bearden, 52, said on Sunday that he was sympathetic to the circumstances of people living in war-torn countries, but that he couldn\u2019t shake the fear of another terrorist attack, like those in Boston, Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif..\n\n\u201cSadly, for whatever reason, it seems that the majority of terrorists worldwide seem to be of the Muslim faith,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe mad rush to bring them in at all costs actually is not a good thing. If it turns out that they are decent, peace loving individuals, then certainly I got no problem with them, even living on my street.\u201d\n\nOn Long Island, Kathleen Ganci, the widow of the highest ranking New York City Fire Department official killed on Sept. 11, held a similar view.\n\n\u201cDo I want them banned forever? Of course not,\u201d said Ms. Ganci, whose husband, Chief of Department Peter J. Ganci Jr., was crushed in the collapse of 1 World Trade Center. \u201cThere\u2019s many, many fine Muslim people in this world, but there\u2019s many many people who want to kill us, and we need to vet them, and we need to find out.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe should be wiser and smarter, and I think we haven\u2019t been over the last eight years \u2014 we\u2019re so idealistic \u2014 not necessarily the people affected, but the people who aren\u2019t affected. Walk in my shoes, is my point. You can\u2019t just let people into this country because you have a big heart.\u201d \u2014 CAITLIN DICKERSON and ANDY NEWMAN\n\nDallas mayor apologizes to detainees\n\nDallas\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mike Rawlings, apologized \u201con behalf of the citizens of Dallas\u201d to the dozens detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\u201cThe tide is turning, the sun is rising and these important visitors to our city are here,\u201d Mr. Rawlings said at a news conference at the airport on Sunday alongside four released detainees. \u201cWe have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart.\u201d\n\nMr. Rawlings said he was \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d at the ongoing situation at the airport, where 50 travelers had been detained at one point, according to The Dallas Observer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mayor said he was proud of the protesters who had gathered at the airport, the airport staff and those who had expressed their support on social media. \u2013 LIAM STACK\n\nOlympic gold medalist opposes Trump order\n\nMo Farah, the Olympic gold medal runner who was born in Somalia, grew up in Britain and has lived in the United States for six years, took to Facebook to criticize the president\u2019s ban:\n\n\u201cOn 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.\u201d\n\nMr. Farah, who won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, and who lives in Oregon, continued:\n\nI am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years \u2014 working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home \u2014 to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. I was welcomed into Britain from Somalia at eight years old and given the chance to succeed and realise my dreams. I have been proud to represent my country, win medals for the British people and receive the greatest honour of a knighthood. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order bars visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Somalia. It is unclear whether the travel ban applies to Mr. Farah.\n\nThe ban could have a major effect on international sports.\n\nUber is drawn into conflict\n\nThe ride-hailing app Uber on Saturday was drawn into the conflict over Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order after the company told its customers that surge pricing had been turned off at Kennedy Airport, where protesters had gathered.\n\nSome interpreted the alert, which was issued over the company\u2019s Twitter account, as an attempt to attract business after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance announced a one-hour work stoppage to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nUber quickly clarified, saying that the announcement was not meant to affect the strike. In a statement, the company\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, said that drivers outside the United States affected by the ban would be compensated by Uber for three months. The statement did not specify what that compensation would be.\n\nDespite Mr. Kalanick\u2019s efforts, however, the battle lines had already been drawn. A social media campaign calling for users to delete the Uber app from their cellphones was soon underway.\n\nUsing the hashtag #deleteuber, Twitter users posted screenshots of their phones as they deleted their apps. By Sunday, Uber\u2019s competitor Lyft, perhaps sensing an opportunity, announced in a letter to customers that it had donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd even as Uber said it was not responding to the move by taxi drivers, some came to the company\u2019s defense. Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and a political adviser to Mr. Trump, posted on Twitter in support of Uber, calling the protests \u201cmanufactured outrage.\u201d\n\n\u2014 JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH\n\nNew York congressman praises ban\n\nWhile several members of New York\u2019s congressional delegation have been involved in helping travelers detained at Kennedy Airport, one Republican representative, Lee Zeldin, said he supported Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cEvery American has sympathy for the innocent person who is looking to come to America for a better life, but the process must without exception prioritize America\u2019s national security first,\u201d Mr. Zeldin, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who represents parts of Long Island, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow someone entry until we know for sure they will not pose a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ultimate humanitarian victory is to assist with efforts to stabilize these nations and eliminate the threats there to peace.\u201d \u2014 DIEGO RIBADENEIRA\n\n\n\nTrump on execution of Middle East Christians: \u2018Cannot allow this horror\u2019\n\nThe president took to Twitter on Sunday morning to justify his order giving priority to Christian refugees from mostly Muslim countries. That provision has been criticized across the religious spectrum, including by Christian leaders.", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Andy Newman", "type": "article"}
