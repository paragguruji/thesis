The Levant denotes an area larger than Syria.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ethics policy also has provisions that will affect officials while they are working in the government. As part of the order he signed, executive branch employees will be barred for two years from working on any \u201cparticular matter\u201d that they had been involved in while in the private sector. That is the same amount of time that Mr. Obama imposed on officials who worked for him.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s measure would prohibit Rex W. Tillerson, who has been nominated to serve as secretary of state, from playing any role in matters related to Exxon Mobil, where until recently he had served as chief executive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, has repeatedly sued the agency.\n\nNorman L. Eisen, the ethics lawyer when Mr. Obama arrived in the White House and the chief author of the rules that Mr. Trump is now replacing, commended much of Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nBut Mr. Eisen and other ethics experts noted that rules banning lobbyists from taking any job with an agency they had tried to influence in the past two years had been removed. Also, the new rules allow departing executive branch employees to take private sector jobs and then informally lobby the administration, as long as they are not registered as a lobbyist, a type of activity previously prohibited for two years. Registration is required once a person does a certain amount of work for a client.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is much to like,\u201d Mr. Eisen said of the new executive order. \u201cBut it gives nonlobbyists too much leeway when they leave. That is where the biggest problem in the system is: unregistered, shadow lobbyists. They should be getting more regulation, not less.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cTrump kept the Obama limits on the revolving door coming into government, but eliminated Obama\u2019s revolving door protections for nonlobbyists leaving government.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State directive calls on Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to devise a more aggressive plan to destroy the group. During the campaign, Mr. Trump widely criticized the handling of the operations by the Obama administration and the military. At one point, he said that he knew \u201cmore about ISIS than the generals do.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said during the campaign that he would ask for the 30-day review. He claimed that he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS.\n\nBecause Mr. Trump had been explicit about his intention to ask for the review, military planners have been drafting classified options to provide to Mr. Trump.\n\nAmong the measures that Mr. Mattis may ultimately recommend are using American artillery on the ground in Syria and using Army attack helicopters to help with the invasion of the group\u2019s de facto capital, Raqqa.", "authors": ["Michael S.
