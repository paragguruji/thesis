While Turks were not subject to the ban, most interviewed at Trump Towers were nevertheless offended by its principle and expressed solidarity with those from the affected countries.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether Turkey is included or not \u2014 I\u2019m against it,\u201d the younger Ms. Sumeli said while gathering her things. If \u201cmy government banned Christians,\u201d she added, \u201cI\u2019d be against that, too.\u201d\n\nTrump Towers Istanbul is a two-pronged construct: an office block and an apartment complex that jut skyward from a multistory mall at the bottom.\n\nThough it stands in a country increasingly blighted by terrorism, and though it is named for a man increasingly at odds with the Muslim world, security is light. As at most malls in this city, there is just a single airport-style X-ray machine at each entrance. The local municipality says it has no plans to increase security, and visitors themselves displayed few signs of concern.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Trump\u2019s or not,\u201d said Ozan Tung, a 23-year-old actor who was finishing off a chicken curry. \u201cWhat else am I going to do if I don\u2019t come here?\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Trump has received his fair share of bad publicity in Turkey. In June, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even called for the towers to be renamed, in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s Islamophobic remarks during the campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince Mr. Trump announced his travel ban, Mr. Erdogan has avoided directly condemning Mr. Trump, leaving criticism to colleagues in his government. Analysts speculate that Mr. Erdogan is waiting to see how Mr. Trump approaches Turkey before voicing his disapproval too openly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForeign visitors to the mall would recognize many of the shops; Benetton, Burger King, Mango and Lacoste all have a home there. In the basement is a playground and a carousel, among other attractions for children.\n\nAnd at the very top of the escalators is the most familiar name of all: Trump Cadde, or Trump Avenue. It\u2019s a string of upscale cafes clustered around the mall\u2019s main attraction, a restaurant called Trumpet.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They were wary of giving their full names because of the purge of government employees that followed the failed coup last year, but the question of the mall\u2019s eponym nevertheless set off a lively discussion.\n\nAyten B., 45, won\u2019t be coming again, she declared, to nods of approval from her friends. If their children didn\u2019t like the playground in the basement so much, they said, they wouldn\u2019t have come in the first place. But, Ayten said, there\u2019s something to Mr. Trump\u2019s thought process: Look at all those bad things happening in the seven banned countries.\n\nHatice E., 43, agreed. Iran is a law unto itself, and there\u2019s chaos across Iraq, Somalia and Yemen. Who would want that?\n\nAyse G., 40, gently constructed a counterargument. Why should Mr. Trump punish a whole religion, she asked, rather than just the few people responsible?\n\nThen the coffees arrived and Hacer N., 43, spoke up. If Mr. Trump is against Muslims, she wondered, why has he built a mall in a Muslim country? He shouldn\u2019t be erecting buildings here, Ayse chimed in, if he doesn\u2019t like Muslims.\n\nThe Sumeli sisters said they were mystified by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s approach to Mr. Trump, and by his other recent diplomatic moves, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cActually I can\u2019t understand it,\u201d Evin said. \u201cHe has good relations with someone, and then he breaks that relationship. He has bad relations with Russia, and then he fixes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mizgin added.\n\nBut elsewhere in the building, not everyone was so concerned. Deep in the bowels of the mall, Umit Basalan, a 29-year-old shopkeeper, said there was little wrong with Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban.\n\n\u201cHis decision was right \u2014 it\u2019s not about Muslims, it\u2019s about terror,\u201d said Mr. Basalan, suggesting that Turkey should copy Mr. Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cAt first he spoke about Muslims, but then he just referred to these seven countries.\u201d\n\nMr. Basalan fondly remembered a 2012 visit by Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump. \u201cMaybe,\u201d Mr. Basalan concluded, \u201cshe brings business.\u201d\n\nTwo floors above, the Sumeli sisters had just made their exit. \u201cWe were going to tour around,\u201d the elder sister said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re just going to leave.\u201d", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley"], "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["main", "trump", "visitors", "sumeli", "turkey", "towers", "complex", "trumps", "sisters", "istanbul", "mall", "basalan", "linked", "mr", "surprise"], "summary": "In June, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even called for the towers to be renamed, in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s Islamophobic remarks during the campaign.\nPhotoSince Mr. Trump announced his travel ban, Mr. Erdogan has avoided directly condemning Mr. Trump, leaving criticism to colleagues in his government.\nAnalysts speculate that Mr. Erdogan is waiting to see how Mr. Trump approaches Turkey before voicing his disapproval too openly.\nWhy should Mr. Trump punish a whole religion, she asked, rather than just the few people responsible?\nThe Sumeli sisters said they were mystified by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s approach to Mr. Trump, and by his other recent diplomatic moves, too."}
