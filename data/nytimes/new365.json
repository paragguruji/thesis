Violators face a fine of 150 euros. A woman with a full facial veil was spotted in the audience at Op\u00e9ra Bastille in Paris in 2014 and some of the performers refused to sing. After she was asked to uncover her face or leave, she and her husband left.\n\nA similar ban in Belgium went into effect in 2011.\n\nGermany\u2019s Parliament this year approved a draft law banning women working in the judiciary, the civil service or the military from wearing face-covering veils, and will come into effect soon.\n\nIn December, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced her support for the ban, arguing that full facial veils were \u201cnot acceptable in Germany.\u201d She called for them to be prohibited \u201cwherever it is legally possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Union\u2019s highest court entered into the politically explosive debate in March, ruling that private employers can prohibit female workers from wearing head scarves on the job as long as it applies to religious garb from all faiths.", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky", "Victor Homola"], "publish_date": "2017-05-17", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["values", "women", "veils", "ban", "party", "come", "public", "freedom", "parliament", "austrian", "religious", "wearing", "facial", "bans", "york"], "summary": "That could create an opportunity for the far-right Freedom Party to enter government for the second time since it was formed by former Nazis in the 1950s.\nThe Freedom Party\u2019s nominee for president of Austria lost to a moderate in May and December of last year.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nIn 2010, the French Parliament voted to ban the wearing of face-concealing veils in public places, making France the first country to do so.\nGermany\u2019s Parliament this year approved a draft law banning women working in the judiciary, the civil service or the military from wearing face-covering veils, and will come into effect soon."}
