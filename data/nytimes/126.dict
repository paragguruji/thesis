But there was a counterpunch. For every tweet about plans to boycott, someone else tweeted something like this: \u201cThere is a #boycottStarbucks going around because they\u2019re pledging to hire refugees, you know what that means? Time to get some Starbucks.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola didn\u2019t say anything until late Monday, when the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said the company opposed the travel ban. Many other large companies have so far remained silent on the issue. Among them are Blackstone Group, Disney, General Motors and Pepsico.\n\nAnd while the criticism (although limited) was real, few took shots directly at Mr. Trump, for fear of retribution. The harshest comment from a C.E.O. of a large, public company appeared to come from Reed Hastings of Netflix, who directly named the president: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all.\u201d\n\n(It\u2019s easy to surmise that Netflix could soon be on the losing end of Mr. Trump\u2019s possible plan to upend net-neutrality laws.)\n\nBut most top executives took a more circuitous route. The wording was purposely dripping with politeness: \u201cThis executive order is one we do not support,\u201d became the language almost universally adopted by C.E.O.s.\n\nOf course, the business community, up until this past weekend, has largely cheered many of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to lower taxes, remove regulations and invest in infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral dozen chief executives have found their ways onto a variety of councils to meet with Mr. Trump and advise him on business issues, making it even thornier to criticize him in public.\n\nTake Elon Musk, for example. The mogul and man behind Tesla and SpaceX now has a seat at the table in the White House to help advise the president on manufacturing, a role that this column supported.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy all accounts, people close to Mr. Musk say he was upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but offered a somewhat tepid rebuke on Twitter: \u201cThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d\n\nHe quickly found himself as the target of criticism from fans who wanted him to go further. \u201cExpected a much more forceful condemnation from someone like Elon,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\nA lot of the discussion among C.E.O.s, which they shared with me anonymously for fear of retribution for even discussing the subject, said that in the Venn diagram they made about how to deal with public issues like this, they came back to the word \u201ctrade-off.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One executive explained that he could offer a morally righteous argument that would feel good in the moment and probably cause a series of cheering \u2014 and booing \u2014 from his various constituents, while potentially losing whatever influence he might have on the president to guide him to make sensible policy in other areas. Or he could offer a Milquetoast response that appeased his employees and nodded at the issue without upsetting his relationship with the president.\n\nMr. Musk used his Twitter account to solicit suggestions to take to Mr. Trump. \u201cPlease read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President.\u201d\n\nGiven that Mr. Musk has been willing to bring up contentious subjects with Mr. Trump in the past \u2014 like introducing a carbon tax \u2014 perhaps making the point in person will do more than doing so in an email or on Twitter.\n\nWhatever the case, the first shots between the business world and the White House have been fired. And more are likely to come.\n\nAaron Levie, chief executive of the electronic storage company Box, was publicly critical of the executive order and wrote on Twitter that maybe there is too much overthinking of what a public company can say.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some strange mythology that when you go public you can\u2019t speak up,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from plenty of investors appreciating our stance.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Andrew Ross Sorkin", "type": "article"}
