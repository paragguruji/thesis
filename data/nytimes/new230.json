But the Normandie, a French ship that burned and capsized in New York City on this day 75 years ago, was nearly as remarkable.\n\nLaunched in 1932, it was the first liner to exceed 1,000 feet in length. The Normandie was lauded as the biggest, fastest luxury ship afloat, featuring a first-class dining room with a sumptuous Art Deco interior.\n\nAfter World War II started, though, the ocean liner never again sailed. It was held and eventually taken over by the U.S. military, which renamed it the U.S.S. Lafayette, after the French general who helped America during the Revolutionary War.\n\nDuring its conversion to a troopship in 1942, the Normandie caught fire and tipped over. Sabotage was suspected but never proven. The official cause was listed as life preservers set ablaze by a welder\u2019s torch.\n\nA year later, the ship was salvaged, and then scrapped.\n\nBut the Normandie was not forgotten. Its steam whistle blew again in 2010 to commemorate the anniversary of its first arrival in New York.\n\nDes Shoe contributed reporting.\n\n_____\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.\n\nWhat would you like to see here?
