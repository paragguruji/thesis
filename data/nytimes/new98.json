Politicians who have called for restricting Muslim immigration have gained support in a number of European countries, and one of them, Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, praised Mr. Trump on Twitter: \u201cI would do the same. Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201d\n\nStill, some immigration policy experts in the United States questioned the logic behind the action. They noted that terrorists who had carried out attacks in the United States had not entered as refugees, and that Muslim attackers had been born here or came from countries like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia \u2014 which were not on the list of seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration has singled out for a halt to entry.\n\n\u201cForeigners from those seven nations have killed zero Americans in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and the end of 2015,\u201d Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote on the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president\u2019s more narrowly tailored order as common sense. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-American. I think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201d\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is?

Ganci Jr., the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want other Americans to go through what I did \u2014 because we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.\u201d\n\nAnd Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to restrict immigration, said it makes sense to suspend the refugee program temporarily, examine it, \u201cand at least begin to initiate some changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what form those changes will take, and I\u2019m not sure the administration knows yet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive order put an indefinite halt to citizens of Syria, a country racked by civil war and an immense refugee crisis, entering the United States. It suspended immigration for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended the nation\u2019s program for admitting refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, while the government comes up with a stricter process for vetting them, but allowed for exceptions for persecuted religious minorities, like Christians in Muslim countries.\n\nMr. Trump said the moves were needed to protect the United States from infiltration by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Mr. Ryan released a statement saying, \u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\u201d\n\nMany other leading congressional Republicans did not make statements on the matter, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.\n\nVideo\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, members of Congress were hearing from constituents whose friends or relatives were detained at airports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo Republicans who did not support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s order. Mr. Sasse called it overly broad, saying that it risks playing into the hands of jihadist groups that portray the United States as anti-Muslim.\n\nMr. Dent said he was awakened by his college-aged son, whose Syrian-American friend had six family members being held at Philadelphia\u2019s airport on Saturday morning, though they had valid documents to enter the country. The congressman said that despite his attempts to intervene with government officials, the family was placed on a flight bound for Qatar.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe order was rushed through without any nuances toward immigration policy, and this can be life or death for some people.\u201d\n\nThe response from Democrats was scathing. \u201cThis administration has mistaken cruelty for strength and prejudice for strategy,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader. On Twitter, Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote, \u201cTo my colleagues: don\u2019t ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today.\u201d\n\nThe reaction was also largely negative from leaders of Silicon Valley, which relies heavily on employees from abroad, and has many companies founded by immigrants or their children. A Google representative said, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in India, sent a memo to the company\u2019s workers saying that as many as 187 of its employees were affected.\n\nIn a note to his employees, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, \u201cApple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order, he said, \u201cis not a policy we support.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFacebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote on the site that the nation should \u201ckeep our doors open to refugees and those who need help.\u201d\n\nSome colleges and universities had urged students who might be affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to return to the United States before Inauguration Day if they were abroad, or to remain in the country if they were already here.\n\nThe seven countries covered by the temporary ban have about 13,000 citizens who are college or graduate students in the United States, said the American Council on Education. The group said it was unclear how many were stuck abroad. \u201cIt is clearly up to the federal government to decide how to safeguard our nation, but at the same time, it is in America\u2019s interest to remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s students and scholars,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, the group\u2019s executive vice president.\n\nThe president\u2019s action poses a particular challenge to Christian leaders whose followers have largely supported Mr. Trump, but whose organizations are among the most active on behalf of refugees.\n\nJen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, said that the executive order was \u201cakin to President Trump taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty.\u201d\n\nAs reports circulated about travelers being stopped upon arrival, protests broke out at several airports, including San Francisco International, O\u2019Hare in Chicago, Dulles outside Washington and Kennedy in New York.\n\nBy sundown the boisterous crowd shouting \u201cLet them in!\u201d at Kennedy\u2019s Terminal 4 had spread along the parking apron, the ramp to the elevator and on three floors of the adjoining parking deck. Airport officials briefly closed the shuttle train to Kennedy before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, in a show of solidarity with protesters, ordered it reopened.\n\nOne of the protesters, Jacki Esposito, an immigration lawyer from Brooklyn, said of the officials deciding the refugees\u2019 fate: \u201cWe want to let them know we are watching.\u201d", "authors": ["Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "trump", "ban", "immigration", "policy", "anger", "refugees", "muted", "united", "states", "trumps", "draws", "praise", "order", "mr", "deep"], "summary": "Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201dStill, some immigration policy experts in the United States questioned the logic behind the action.\nThe president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if muted, reaction from some Republicans, and could prove popular politically.\nI think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201dAffected by Trump\u2019s order?\nAre you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is?\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyTwo Republicans who did not support Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s order."}
