It\u2019s not hard to see why. The Muslim Ban Lite is an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration stumbled spectacularly in its first major attempt to deliver on a campaign promise.\n\nAnd yet, as administration officials made the case on Monday for the revised measures, there was no hint of contrition and plenty of reckless fearmongering. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the president was exercising his \u201crightful authority to keep our people safe.\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned, without providing context or evidence, that more than 300 people admitted to the United States as refugees had been investigated by the F.B.I. for possible terrorism links. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, meanwhile, lamented that \u201cour enemies often use our own freedoms and generosity against us.\u201d\n\nThe administration has failed to make a reasonable \u2014 let alone persuasive \u2014 case for barring people from the six nations.

That plan remains a mystery.", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
