Executive orders that go after specific groups under the guise of protecting the American people are not only unconstitutional, but morally wrong. My father, and so many other Americans of Japanese descent, were targets of just such an order during World War II.\n\nSeventy-five years ago on Sunday, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Executive Order 9066, all people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast were forced to leave their homes and report to incarceration camps. Two-thirds were American citizens. Fred Korematsu, my father, then 23, refused to go. A proud and loyal citizen, he had tried to enlist in the National Guard but was rejected and was wrongly fired from his job as a welder in an Oakland, Calif., shipyard. He was arrested and tried for defying the executive order. Upon conviction, he was held in a horse stall at a hastily converted racetrack until he and his family were moved to a desolate camp in Topaz, Utah. My father told me later that jail was better than the camp.\n\nHe appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In his case, and in cases brought by Minoru Yasui and Gordon Hirabayashi \u2014 among the most infamous cases in American legal history \u2014 the court in 1944 upheld the executive order. Justice Frank Murphy vehemently opposed the majority decision, writing in a dissenting opinion, \u201cRacial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life.\u201d In the hysteria of war and racialized propaganda, my father\u2019s citizenship did not protect him. For him and the 120,000 other Japanese-Americans incarcerated during World War II, there was no attempt to sort the loyal from the disloyal.\n\nIn 1982, almost 40 years after my father\u2019s conviction, evidence was discovered proving that the wartime government suppressed, altered and destroyed material evidence while arguing my father\u2019s, Yasui\u2019s and Hirabayashi\u2019s cases before the Supreme Court. The government\u2019s claims that people of Japanese descent had engaged in espionage and that mass incarceration was necessary to protect the country were not only false, but had even been refuted by the government\u2019s own agencies, including the Office of Naval Intelligence, the F.B.I. and the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith that evidence, my father reopened his case. In November 1983, he stood before a Federal District Court judge, Marilyn Hall Patel, and said, \u201cAs long as my record stands in federal court, any American citizen can be held in prison or concentration camps without a trial or a hearing.\u201d Judge Patel overturned my father\u2019s conviction, declaring that his case \u201cstands as a caution that in times of distress the shield of military necessity and national security must not be used to protect governmental actions from close scrutiny and accountability.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
