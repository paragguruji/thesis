In the current fiscal year, New York City expects to receive $8.8 billion in federal funding for a variety of programs, including education and transportation, to fill out its $84.8 billion annual budget. But the administration\u2019s ability to turn off the federal funds is limited, legal advisers to Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nAccording to Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, the federal grants that might be vulnerable include $9 million from the Department of Justice and $156 million from the Department of Homeland Security. But because that money is for counterterrorism efforts, it would seem unlikely that it would be cut.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric doesn\u2019t match the legal authority,\u201d said Peter L. Markowitz, the director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. \u201cIn fact, the president has very limited power to exercise any kind of significant defunding.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2012 Supreme Court decision, Mr. Markowitz said, Congress is not permitted to set conditions on spending to coerce states or localities to participate in a federal program against their will. Any conditions, at a minimum, must be directly related to the punitive action.\n\nIn other words, Mr. Markowitz said: \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018if you don\u2019t use your police officers to go after unauthorized immigrants, you don\u2019t get any money for your hospitals.\u2019 They can\u2019t impose conditions that are totally unrelated.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national group, at least 39 cities and 364 counties nationwide count themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions, but they vary in how limited they are in restricting cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n\nCalifornia has been one of the leaders in offering sanctuary, and reaction there was strong.\n\nAn hour after the president signed the order, a group of California state senators said they planned to fight it in court, with help from Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general, whom the Legislature has retained to take on what the senators said they expected would be continued fights with the Trump administration. They said Mr. Trump\u2019s order violated the 10th Amendment by forcing local governments to enforce federal statutes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, who counts his city among the ranks of sanctuaries without using the term, said that, on matters of public safety, \u201dour police chief is the best person to decide how to use the scarce resources we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not simply an ideological decision,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Police Department, like most, doesn\u2019t engage in federal tax laws, federal environmental laws or federal immigration laws.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco featured prominently in the debate over sanctuary city policies after the killing of Kathryn Steinle, a resident of the city, in July 2015.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Steinle was 32 when she was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an immigrant from Mexico who was in the United States illegally. He had a long criminal record, a history of heroin abuse and had been deported to Mexico at least five times.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump seized on Ms. Steinle\u2019s death as \u201cyet another example of why we must secure our border immediately.\u201d\n\nA case brought by the Steinle family in federal court in May blames the San Francisco county sheriff at the time, Ross Mirkarimi, for issuing a memo that ordered his staff to cut off all communication with federal immigration authorities, according to court documents.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Walsh. \u201cTo anyone who feels threatened today, or vulnerable, you are safe in Boston,\u201d Mr. Walsh said at a news conference. \u201cWe will do everything lawful in our powerful to protect you. If necessary, we will use City Hall itself to shelter and protect anyone who\u2019s targeted unjustly.\u201d\n\nMr. Walsh said he would allow people to effectively take up residence inside City Hall, evoking the \u201csanctuary church\u201d movement, in which religious groups have offered shelter to undocumented immigrants who fear deportation.\n\n\u201cThey can use my office, they can use any office in this building,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to use this building as a safe space.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "authors": "Liz Robbins", "type": "article"}
