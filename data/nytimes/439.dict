Pick, Dara Khosrowshahi, Steps Into Brighter Spotlight", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/technology/dara-khosrowshahi-uber-ceo.html?mcubz=0", "text": "At the same moment in June that Mr. Kalanick was noisily being ejected from his company, Mr. Khosrowshahi had a little problem of his own. Glassdoor, a site where employees rank their companies, released its 2017 list of the top chief executives. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s score, for whatever reason, had dropped.\n\nHis parents weighed in with that combination of celebration and criticism that many immigrant children know well. As Mr. Khosrowshahi reported on Twitter, his mother said, \u201cNice! You made the top 100!\u201d But his father pointed out: \u201c#39 is good but you were #11 in 2015.\u201d\n\nLili and Gary (short for Asghar) Khosrowshahi were prosperous members of the Iranian elite in the 1960s and 1970s. Gary was an executive at an industrial conglomerate, where he worked with relatives. They all had to flee Iran in 1978 as the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed.\n\nThey made it to Tarrytown, N.Y., and lived with relatives. \u201cFor the grown-ups, it was a difficult transition,\u201d Dara Khosrowshahi told Bloomberg Businessweek this year. \u201cThe kids were able to party together, so it was fun.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Gary went back to Iran to take care of his ailing father, and he was detained for six years before he could return. Lili had to bring up three children by herself.\n\nHadi Partovi, Dara\u2019s cousin, said in an interview that \u201chis mom raised him to be direct with people. By far the biggest challenge he faced, which is what all of us faced, was having to come to a new country and assimilate. Being an Iranian in America in the 1980s was not pleasant. People were singing \u2018Bomb bomb bomb Iran.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut the tense environment also pushed them to succeed. \u201cEvery one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\u201d Mr. Partovi said. \u201cWe had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd they did. Mr. Partovi is an investor in Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb and, as it happens, Uber; Dara\u2019s brother, Kaveh Khosrowshahi, is a managing director at the investment firm of Allen & Company; another cousin, Farzad \u201cFuzzy\u201d Khosrowshahi, played a major role in the creation of Google Docs; yet another cousin, Avid Larizadeh Duggan, is a general partner at Google Ventures.\n\nMr. Khosrowshahi, in fact, did so well that in 2015, he was the highest-paid executive in America as calculated by Equilar. Thanks to a large stock option grant, he made $94.6 million. In 2016, without the grant, his pay was $2.5 million.\n\nMr. Khosrowshahi, in addition to running Expedia, has been on the board of The New York Times Company since 2015.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Barry Diller was a client, and Mr. Khosrowshahi decided he wanted to work for the media mogul. So he did.\n\nIn 2001, Mr. Diller acquired Expedia, a travel booking site founded by Microsoft. Four years later, Mr. Khosrowshahi became Expedia\u2019s chief executive. The site has flourished, acquiring three major competitors in 2015 alone. Shares in the company, which is now publicly traded, have risen 35 percent over the last year, despite competition from Priceline on one flank and Airbnb on another.\n\n\u201cIf Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing \u2014 he\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a note to Expedia employees on Monday.\n\nUber, like Expedia a decade ago, has enormous promise but also faces enormous peril. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s supporters believe he can fix the underlying problems.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a global travel executive \u2014 he understands competitive dynamics, geopolitical challenges, and the operating challenges of running a sprawling global travel company,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, an investor in Uber as well as Expedia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder Mr. Kalanick, some Uber executives were considered untouchable, which contributed to a poisonous atmosphere. Shana Fisher, who worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi at Mr. Diller\u2019s IAC and is now a venture capitalist, said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t get an excuse with Dara. They have to be good and good. Good and good. He doesn\u2019t have tolerance for less than that.\u201d\n\nOne immediate problem for Mr. Khosrowshahi: The lawsuit filed by Google\u2019s self-driving car spinoff, Waymo. Uber is accused of stealing Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.\n\nMr. Khosrowshahi has clashed with Google before. In 2013, Expedia was one of the companies that filed an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe. Last month, Mr. Khosrowshahi acknowledged that Google was a significant adversary for Expedia.\n\n\u201cThey are a competitor for the consumers\u2019 hearts and minds when they have a travel question,\u201d he told The Financial Times.\n\nMr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s experiences as an immigrant gave him a personal perspective on the executive order that President Trump signed restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries this year.\n\nExpedia, along with Amazon, became one of two technology companies to contribute early declarations to a lawsuit filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general objecting to the travel ban. Mr. Khosrowshahi described his early experience as an immigrant in an email to employees.\n\n\u201cWe sure didn\u2019t feel like refugees, but in hindsight I guess we were \u2014 my father and mother left everything behind to come here \u2014 to be safe and give their boys a chance to rebuild a life,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe has expressed other pointed concerns in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. In February, he concluded a conference call with Wall Street analysts by saying, \u201cHopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.\u201d In March, Chelsea Clinton was named to the board of Expedia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Aug. 15, Mr. Khosrowshahi tweeted: \u201cI keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly.\u201d\n\nLili and Gary are clearly watching their son rise to their own expectations. After he was interviewed by Jim Cramer, the host of the financial TV show \u201cMad Money,\u201d in May, Dara tweeted: \u201cdidnt screw it up (according to mom).\u201d\n\nFrom now on, not only will his parents be watching, but just about everyone else as well.", "publish_date": "2017-08-28", "authors": "David Streitfeld and Nellie Bowles", "type": "article"}
