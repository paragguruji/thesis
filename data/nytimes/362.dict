Detainee", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/nyregion/muslim-police-officer-combat-vet-and-detained-without-explanation.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Officer Ali is one of a number of Muslim Americans who have complained that since the start of the Trump administration they have been subjected to additional scrutiny when returning from abroad, facing hours in airport custody and what they described as hostile questioning. A retired North Carolina police chief, Hassan Aden, recounted an experience similar to Officer Ali\u2019s, also at J.F.K., in March.\n\nPhoto\n\nForeigners with valid travel documents have similar complaints: Among the first people caught up in President Trump\u2019s travel ban was an Iraqi interpreter who had worked for American forces and the American government in his homeland. He was among those detained at J.F.K. An Afghan family was detained at Los Angeles International Airport in March when it arrived on the same kind of Special Immigrant Visas for resettlement that the interpreter had.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one who you would think should be able to sail through immigration at the airport more than Syed,\u201d said Justin Cox, a staff lawyer at the National Immigration Law Center, who spoke with Officer Ali after the incident and is following the treatment of Muslim immigrants at airports. \u201cNone of that mattered because he\u2019s brown and Muslim. That\u2019s what his case underlines.\u201d\n\nAt the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, apartment Officer Ali shares with his sister, a \u201cwelcome home\u201d sign in large multicolored letters still hung on his bedroom wall, and a slightly shriveled red-white-and-blue balloon clung to its last gasp of buoyancy. Their apartment was filled with mementos from Officer Ali\u2019s military career: a plaque for \u201coutstanding service\u201d in the fight against the Islamic State, a collage of photographs from his deployment to Afghanistan in 2013 and his Combat Action Badge, awarded to soldiers engaged in ground combat, which he earned while deployed to Iraq during the surge in 2008.\n\nAt the moment, he was preoccupied with passing the Police Department\u2019s sergeant\u2019s exam, having fallen behind in his studies during his long deployment to Kuwait. As an officer in the Army Reserve, Officer Ali was granted a leave of absence from the department for the duration of his mobilization.\n\nHe spoke earnestly about how much he enjoyed making people feel safe while patrolling the subway. In one case, he said, he chased down a thief who had stolen a smartphone from a mute woman who communicated using hand gestures.\n\n\u201cAll I cared about was that we were able to help this girl,\u201d Officer Ali said. \u201cIt\u2019s a true euphoric feeling of doing what I signed up to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficer Ali\u2019s detention that night in late April was not the first time he was sent to secondary inspection. Officers took him aside and checked his identity on a previous trip. He said he had no problem with the polite and expeditious way they had handled him then.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

He enlisted in the Navy before he turned 18 and, after graduating from college, was commissioned in the Army.\n\nOfficer Ali underscored that he was speaking as a private citizen and not on behalf of the United States military or the Police Department.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned with, what is the average citizen going through?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening to other people and it\u2019s probably a lot worse.\u201d\n\nOn the night of April 26, Officer Ali was returning from a trip to Britain to visit his fianc\u00e9e, with a side trip to Istanbul. At J.F.K., the officer checking passports led him to a holding area with two officers at the door. Another officer instructed Officer Ali to give her his passport, which he did.\n\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Hey, you know, I\u2019m a veteran.\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018I should be in the system. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe search for this particular Syed Ali should have been easier than most, he said, because he is all over the federal record system. He said the Army knew everything down to his cholesterol level and how many times he had been vaccinated against anthrax.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has my DNA on record,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government, they know every little nook and cranny about me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter an hour and a half of waiting, Officer Ali began to wonder what the holdup was. \u201cI do identity checks all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m digging hard and digging deep, I might spend at most 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was when he asked the officer who had taken his passport what his status was. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, no, ma\u2019am,\u2019 when I spoke to her because that\u2019s what I was taught,\u201d Officer Ali said. She responded with the threat to lock him up, he said.\n\nAfter that, half a dozen officers surrounded him \u201cas if they\u2019re going to intimidate me or take me down,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly I think the only reason they didn\u2019t stick me in a cell is it wouldn\u2019t look good to stick a major and a cop in a cell.\u201d\n\nDaniel Hetlage, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said privacy laws prevented the agency from discussing individual cases. \u201cOfficers strive to treat all people arriving in the country with dignity and respect,\u201d he said.\n\nMany policies that privacy advocates and immigration lawyers have opposed, including searching phones and laptops and requiring visitors to divulge their social media passwords, predate Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. And complaints about the added scrutiny and even mistreatment of Muslims at airports date to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nOfficer Ali said his feeling of powerlessness in airport custody \u201cwas one of the lowest points in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated my life to public service,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my country to treat me fairly, too.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "authors": "Nicholas Kulish", "type": "article"}
