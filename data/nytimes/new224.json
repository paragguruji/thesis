Friedland asked a few minutes later.\n\nMr. Flentje paused. Then he said yes.\n\n\u201cThere are obviously constitutional limitations, but we\u2019re discussing the risk assessment,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Friedland asked what those limitations were, and Mr. Flentje did not provide a direct answer.\n\nSeveral courts around the nation have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, but the broadest ruling was the one at issue in Tuesday\u2019s arguments in front of the Ninth Circuit. The panel was considering an earlier ruling by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, which allowed previously barred travelers and immigrants to enter the country.\n\nJudge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter, asked Mr. Flentje a hypothetical question meant to probe the limits of his position. \u201cCould the president simply say in the order, \u2018We\u2019re not going to let any Muslims in?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Flentje said the two states that have sued over Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, Washington and Minnesota, would be powerless to challenge that scenario. He said other plaintiffs might be able to sue on religious discrimination grounds.\n\nNoah G. Purcell, Washington State\u2019s solicitor general, fared little better in fending off questions from Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. Judge Clifton said the states\u2019 evidence of religious discrimination was thin, adding that \u201cthe concern for terrorism with those connected with radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJudge Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, did not seem persuaded that immediate suspension of travel from the seven countries was necessary.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHas the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?\u201d she asked Mr. Flentje.\n\nHe responded that the government had not had an opportunity to present evidence in court given the pace of the litigation. \u201cThese proceedings have been moving quite fast, and we\u2019re doing the best we can,\u201d Mr. Flentje said.\n\nWith that, Judge Friedland said, the government\u2019s appeal may be premature.\n\nThe case, State of Washington v. Trump, is in its earliest stages, and the question for the appeals court on Tuesday was a narrow one: Should it stay Judge Robart\u2019s temporary restraining order and reinstate the travel ban while the case proceeds?\n\nThe argument, which lasted about an hour, was conducted over the telephone and was streamed live on the appeals court\u2019s website. In a media advisory issued before the argument, the court said that \u201ca ruling was not expected to come down today, but probably this week.\u201d\n\nMr. Flentje said the travel ban was well within Mr. Trump\u2019s legal authority. A federal statute specifically gave presidents the power to deny entry to people whose presence would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the court should not question Mr. Trump\u2019s motives, and should confine itself instead to \u201cthe four corners of the document.\u201d He said the executive order did not, on its face, discriminate on the basis of religion.\n\nMr. Purcell, the lawyer for Washington State, responded that the underlying purpose of the executive order was religious discrimination. As a candidate, Mr. Purcell said, Mr. Trump had \u201ccalled for a complete ban on the entry of Muslims.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He asked, at a minimum, for the court to reinstate a part of the ban against people who have never been in the United States, calling this a \u201creally key point.\u201d\n\nReading from a brief, he conceded that those who could be allowed entry are \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d\n\nJudge Clifton said that the administration might be in a better position to narrow its executive order. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we look to the executive branch to more clearly define what the order means?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr. Purcell also said that it was hard to tell precisely what distinctions the government meant to draw. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed their mind about five times\u201d since the executive order was issued, he said.\n\nJudge Friedland said that if the executive order violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, the court could block it completely.\n\nBut Judge Clifton said that only a small fraction of the world\u2019s Muslims were affected by the order, suggesting that he was unconvinced that its effect was religious discrimination.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Purcell responded that \u201cwe do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims, or that it harms every Muslim.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe just need to prove that it was motivated in part by a desire to harm Muslims,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judges also questioned whether the two states that brought the challenge had suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gave them standing to sue.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that states suing the federal government to defend their interests are entitled to \u201cspecial solicitude in our standing analysis.\u201d In 2015, an appeals court ruled that Texas had standing to sue the Obama administration to challenge an immigration initiative.\n\nBut the case did not seem likely to stall on the threshold issue of standing. Judge Canby appeared to indicate that the harm to state universities was enough to establish standing.\n\nNor were the judges much interested in another technical question pressed by Mr. Purcell.\n\nJudge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, an interim measure, and Mr. Purcell argued that it was not subject to appeal. In court papers, the Justice Department argued that the order amounted to a preliminary injunction, which can be appealed.\n\nProceedings before Judge Robart are continuing. On Tuesday, he asked for briefs on the question of whether he should issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nAt the close of the appeals court argument, Judge Friedland said she and her colleagues \u201cappreciate the importance and the time-sensitive nature of this matter.\u201d She said the court would rule \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "skeptical", "travel", "mr", "friedland", "ban", "appeals", "judge", "court", "purcell", "states", "trumps", "flentje", "asked", "appears", "order", "panel"], "summary": "\u201cThis is a traditional national security judgment that is assigned to the political branches,\u201d Mr. Flentje said.\nJudge Friedland asked what those limitations were, and Mr. Flentje did not provide a direct answer.\nPhoto\u201cHas the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?\u201d she asked Mr. Flentje.\nMr. Purcell also said that it was hard to tell precisely what distinctions the government meant to draw.\nJudge Friedland said that if the executive order violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, the court could block it completely."}
