{"title": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Order Tests Limits of Law and Executive Power", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-immigration-muslim-ban.html?mcubz=0", "text": "On Sunday, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, appeared to reverse that, but the order still appears to affect foreign students, workers and other visa holders from the targeted countries.\n\nHow is the order being carried out?\n\nThe order clarifies little on enforcement, leaving customs and border officials appearing to improvise.\n\nSeveral federal courts have already prohibited deportations under the ban and have ordered that individuals detained at airports or at the border have access to lawyers. But there have been reports of customs and border officials refusing to comply.\n\nThis appears to set up a potential conflict between the branches of government \u2014 a worrying possibility, as the separation of powers is a cornerstone of American democracy. Should the judicial branch be blocked from performing its role as a check on the executive, it would lead to a constitutional crisis. It is unclear how Mr. Trump would respond to such a crisis or how it would resolve.\n\nCan the president do this unilaterally?\n\nThe president has broad powers to regulate and restrict immigration without congressional approval, though this is limited by certain constitutional protections that could apply.\n\nMr. Trump broke radically in this case with long-held norms of how executive power is exercised. Ordinarily, a president drafts policy changes by consulting, over a period of weeks or months, with federal agencies and other stakeholders in and outside the government.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose practices are meant to vet a policy for its legality and ability to be enforced, as well as for unforeseen consequences. The process also lets agencies begin planning how they will execute the policy and allows those affected to prepare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration appears to have largely skipped that process, drafting this and other recent orders within a small circle of political advisers. Relevant agencies and the National Security Council were granted little or no review over the immigration order before it was signed.\n\nThere is no law mandating such an internal review. But, by forgoing it, the administration circumvented an important internal check on executive power, while creating the impression that it is making critical national policy in slapdash fashion.\n\nThe result has been to leave the vast federal bureaucracy badly prepared to interpret and enforce the sweeping proscriptions. The outcome was confusion at the borders, as Customs and Border Protection officials struggled to enforce the order.\n\nBut internal vetting is about more than practicalities and legalities; it is also meant to protect the core values and interests of the United States. More voices are emerging to challenge the order on those grounds, a concern that will probably remain even if the administration amends the order to pass legal muster.\n\nIs the order legal?\n\nFor judges to issue emergency stays, like those that have already emerged, they must determine that there is a high likelihood that the legal challenge will succeed \u2014 meaning that they think the ban is probably legally deficient, at least when applied to people who have already reached the United States and are holding valid papers.\n\nT. Alexander Aleinikoff, a former general counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a former deputy commissioner of the United Nations refugee agency, said that the ban could conflict with both federal and constitutional law.\n\nThe refugee convention, a United Nations treaty that is incorporated into United States law, prohibits discrimination against refugees on the basis of religion. The Immigration and Nationality Act also prohibits such discrimination in the issuance of visas.\n\n\u201cThere is also the constitutional argument that this is religious discrimination,\u201d Professor Aleinikoff added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe executive order\u2019s vague, confusing language \u2014 which Professor Aleinikoff, a leading expert in immigration law, struggled to interpret with any certainty \u2014 could also leave the order open to arguments that it violates constitutional due process protections.\n\n\u201cThere really are no instructions in here to the officers,\u201d he said, adding that the order\u2019s lack of clarity made it \u201carbitrary\u201d and, in more practical terms, \u201cunworkable.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president has broad legal authority to restrict immigration. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, he can restrict any class of aliens he deems \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d without needing legislation or congressional approval.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

They may be more willing to limit the ban or to strike it down on narrower grounds, such as a lack of regulations to put it into effect.\n\nNarrower challenges could lead the White House to introduce a new order that is more carefully tailored to pass legal muster. Overturning the order outright would most likely require establishing that it is a ban on Muslims, which the White House has denied.\n\nIs this a Muslim ban?\n\nThe order does not explicitly target Muslims but rather nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries, which also contain non-Muslim minorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, there is growing suspicion that the order grew out of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise of, as he put it in a December 2015 statement, \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nCritics have pointed out that, since 2001, no foreign-born citizens from the countries targeted by the order have committed terrorist attacks in the United States. The Sept. 11 hijackers originated from countries not covered by the ban. And Mr. Trump has promised exceptions for Christians from the targeted countries.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Fox News on Saturday that he had helped modify Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign proposal to temporarily bar Muslims into the current order as \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d\n\nThe question of legality matters for civic and political reasons, too. Critics across faith communities, rights groups and legal groups have charged that the order effectively targets Muslims and is therefore both illegal and fundamentally un-American.\n\nThe order and its component parts could eventually be tweaked to withstand judicial review. But it has already stirred debate about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to immigration breaks from long-held American values of pluralism and tolerance.\n\nEven the potential appearance of enforcing federal discrimination against minorities evokes memories of some of the darkest points in American history, such as the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that barred Chinese laborers as racially undesirable and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump first proposed a Muslim ban in 2015, it was condemned almost universally, including by fellow Republicans. Mike Pence, who is now the vice president, wrote on Twitter at the time, \u201cCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNow that Mr. Trump is president, a number of Republican leaders are supporting the order, and many others have declined to challenge it. That, in turn, raises questions about whether American political norms could shift \u2014 or already have \u2014 to allow for policies that were considered unthinkable only a year ago.", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Amanda Taub and Max Fisher", "type": "article"}
