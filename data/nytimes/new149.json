The election of Mr. Trump, whose harsh talk about immigration was central to his campaign, left the deal in doubt, and its future was considered an early test for relations between the United States and Australia.\n\n\u201cI thank President Trump for his commitment to honor that existing agreement,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said during a news conference on Monday in Canberra, the Australian capital. Mr. Turnbull did not provide details on how many refugees, who have been banished to Nauru and Manus by Australia after being intercepted at sea trying to reach its shores, would be going to the United States under the one-time agreement or when they were likely to be resettled. Hundreds of people are housed in offshore detention facilities on the islands in what rights groups describe as inhumane conditions.\n\nThe deal had been under negotiation for months before being announced in mid-November, shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. As a presidential candidate, he pressed for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration, though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants from \u201cterror-prone regions.\u201d His executive order on immigration, enacted on Friday, banned immediate entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries, and it further fueled speculation that the deal with Australia might be derailed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDougal Robinson, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney, estimated that fewer than 2,000 detainees would be sent to the United States. \u201cThey\u2019ve already had significant vetting by Australian authorities and any refugees that will be settled in the U.S. will be subject to \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 by Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cIf the Trump administration at any point is going to accept refugees then these refugees are probably better placed than most others.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The majority of refugees on Manus and Nauru are from Iran and Iraq, and it is unclear whether a proven refugee on Nauru and Manus who is from those countries and had been successfully vetted by the Homeland Security Department would receive the same treatment as a refugee not from those countries. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear indication of the mechanics of the deal and how it will work,\u201d Mr. Robinson said.\n\nThe Australian government has pledged never to accept migrants who attempt to come to the country by boat. Those who are intercepted at sea are housed indefinitely on offshore islands, which the government says is necessary to deter human traffickers who often pack migrants into boats for the long journeys.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Williams"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["australia", "accept", "trump", "nauru", "deal", "onetime", "manus", "united", "states", "migrants", "refugees", "honor", "mr", "australian"], "summary": "VideoSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 President Trump confirmed that his administration would honor a refugee resettlement deal for the United States to accept migrants Australia has detained on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus, the Australian prime minister said on Monday.\nMr. Trump agreed to maintain the agreement, reached under the Obama administration, during a 25-minute telephone call on Sunday, said the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.\nThe election of Mr. Trump, whose harsh talk about immigration was central to his campaign, left the deal in doubt, and its future was considered an early test for relations between the United States and Australia.\nThe deal had been under negotiation for months before being announced in mid-November, shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyDougal Robinson, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney, estimated that fewer than 2,000 detainees would be sent to the United States."}
