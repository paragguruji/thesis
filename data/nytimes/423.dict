(Only recently have we recognized same-sex spouses.) But the nuclear family is not the normative family unit in much of the world \u2014 or for many in the United States, for that matter. In addition, the government has used an arbitrary distinction between citizens and permanent residents to make the rules narrower still. Those definitions have effectively served only one purpose: to constrain the volume of immigration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur most family-friendly immigration era was before World War I. At a time when there were hardly any restrictions on European immigration, there were no rules defining who was a family member. Some Europeans came as nuclear household units. Many others sent an adult male first, to scope out work opportunities and communities, and later sent for relatives \u2014 a nephew, say, or a cousin. Families determined their migration strategies according to their needs, aspirations and means.\n\nThose flexible practices became constrained, if not impossible, after Congress imposed numerical quotas on immigration in the 1920s. Under pressure from Americans who argued that, as citizens, they had the right to bring relatives from abroad, Congress exempted the wives and children of citizens from immigration quotas. The disqualification of relatives of noncitizens especially hurt those from the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe, which suffered from extremely low quotas. Worse, Chinese-Americans found that the law of racial exclusion overrode their rights as citizens to bring wives and children.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Only in 1965, when Congress overhauled the immigration law, were parents of citizens added as non-quota immigrants. The law also established preferences within the quotas for spouses and children of permanent residents and for adult children and adult siblings of citizens. Those expansions aimed to accommodate Europeans, who made up a vast majority of the foreign-born. Some members of Congress cynically believed the system of family preferences would preserve the white racial majority of the population.\n\nIn the decades since, restrictionists have called for eliminating some of the family preferences, especially the \u201cbrother and sister\u201d category, which is heavily used by immigrants from Mexico, India, the Philippines and China.\n\nWhat would a more family-friendly immigration policy look like? First, we should loosen the numerical restrictions on immigration to allow for a greater number of relatives to immigrate. Proposals to eliminate various family preferences often assume a zero-sum calculation \u2014 adult siblings are deemed dispensable so more visas can go to spouses \u2014 but why can\u2019t we increase the overall number of relatives eligible for immigration?\n\nSecond, we should expand the definition of family to include grandparents, aunts and uncles and other close relations. In many cultures, extended families provide support for their members by pooling resources, whether income or cross-generational care. They generate close emotional and practical ties beyond the nuclear family unit. \u201cTio\u201d and \u201ctia\u201d may want to immigrate to pursue a business opportunity, which might in turn provide resources for nieces and nephews and other family members in both the United States and the home country. \u201cNai-nai\u201d may wish to join her grandchildren in America after becoming widowed. Those are reasonable interests and wishes that we should accommodate.\n\nIn the Federal District Court ruling that expanded the scope of exemptions, Judge Derrick Watson stated that the Trump administration\u2019s exclusion of grandparents defied \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Indeed it did. But such policies have seldom been a matter of common sense. The battle over who is a \u201cclose family relation\u201d highlights an uncomfortable truth about American immigration policy: It limits family unification in the service of restrictionist and, at times, discriminatory goals.", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "authors": "Mae Ngai", "type": "article"}
