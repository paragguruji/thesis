Refugees from those countries and elsewhere who were rushing to reach the United States had likewise already been vetted, even more extensively, in a process that involves dozens of checks and can take more than two years.\n\nBut it was unclear whether a court order blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s policy from taking effect, issued by a federal judge in Seattle, would remain in place for long, creating a sense of urgency among those trying to reach the United States.\n\nThe back and forth had sown confusion, anxiety, fear and disbelief, but the court order created \u201ca temporary window that we wish to take advantage of,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental agency that facilitates refugee resettlement. \u201cOur staff are being told to move like crazy.\u201d\n\nFamilies and immigration advocacy groups were buoyed twice over the weekend \u2014 first when the Seattle judge temporarily blocked the executive order, and again when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco denied the government\u2019s attempt to gain an emergency stay. But a mood of uncertainty persisted after a week in which thousands of travelers bound for the United States were halted in transit and turned away at airports, and courts across the country issued conflicting rulings over whether and how the executive order should be carried out.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump reacted angrily on Sunday. In a Twitter post, he seemed to give immigration lawyers and advocates reason to fear that the country may not remain open for long to refugees, or to visa holders from the seven nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\u201cI have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Doyle said that between Monday and Feb. 17, about 2,000 refugees would be rebooked on flights to the United States. Those who were expected to leave first had moved out of their apartments or refugee camps, sold their belongings and turned in their food ration cards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Kenya, dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were waiting on Sunday in the refugee camp, where they were told that they might be able to travel in the next few days. But they were no longer sure who \u2014 or what \u2014 to believe.\n\n\u201cI feel completely ruined,\u201d said Ahmed Hassan, a Somali refugee heading for Rhode Island. In the past few weeks, Mr. Hassan was bused out of the camp; sent to a transit center in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, several hundred miles away; given travel documents; told he was about to fly to America; told he was not about to fly to America; bused back to the camp; and then told he might actually fly to America after all. He boarded a bus in Nairobi to return to the camp just hours before the federal judge lifted the travel ban.\n\nMr. Hassan had sold his home and feared that he could be targeted as an American sympathizer by the Islamist and anti-American militants known to move in and out of the camps. He had arrived back at the refugee camp on Saturday afternoon, retreated from the crowds shouting questions at him and hid inside a room.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Dr. Fadlalla is a second-year resident at Interfaith Medical Center in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and had been on vacation visiting his mother in Sudan, his first time home in three years.\n\nWhen Dr. Fadlalla appeared, the boy went running across the arrivals hall, leapt and wrapped himself around the doctor, crushing the tiny sign.\n\nDr. Fadlalla was ebullient but fatigued. Though he holds a visa for people in specialty professions, he had been turned away at the airport, and spent a week marooned in Sudan. Around him, members of his union, Committee of Interns and Residents, wearing white lab coats, cheered.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad justice won,\u201d he said, adding that he was happy to return to his family and patients. \u201cI need to get back to my work.\u201d\n\nAcross the country on Sunday, the nongovernmental agencies that place refugees into homes and help them find jobs were gearing up to resettle as many as possible, while recovering from the whiplash of last week. Before Friday, their work had begun to trickle off, as they could resettle only refugees who were already in transit when the president\u2019s order was signed. They had been preparing for their activities to come to a halt for four months in accordance with the order.\n\nLeslie Aizenman, of Jewish Family and Children\u2019s Services, a resettlement agency in Pittsburgh, had already put back on the market an apartment prepared for a family from Homs, Syria, who had been scheduled to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The State Department canceled their trip last week, and Ms. Aizenman was unsure when it would be rescheduled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer staff had already returned the backpacks filled with school supplies and stuffed animals they had prepared for the family\u2019s 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. They had also told another Syrian family in Pittsburgh, who had volunteered to make a warm meal to welcome their new neighbors, not to bother.\n\nBecause of the last-minute change, Ms. Aizenman said that refugee family may have to live briefly in temporary housing, and settle for a restaurant meal rather than something homemade.\n\n\u201cWe had stopped the process, but no matter what, we\u2019ll accommodate them when they get here,\u201d she said.\n\nAn interim ruling on whether the executive order may be enforced is likely to come quickly from the appeals court. But the ultimate decision on whether the order is lawful will take much longer, and is likely to come from the Supreme Court. That means people seeking to travel or settle here may be in limbo until the case is finally resolved. Over the weekend, lawyers were telling clients to take advantage of the precarious window.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging people to come in as soon as possible,\u201d said Mary McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center, a Chicago-based organization that provides legal services and advocacy to immigrants. \u201cIf you need to be back in this country, you should do it now.\u201d\n\nMs. McCarthy said her organization had been in regular contact throughout the weekend with a network of roughly 1,500 lawyers who had volunteered to help travelers pro bono. They were just some of the lawyers stationed in shifts at airports across the country, observing customs officials to ensure that the Seattle judge\u2019s ruling was being carried out.\n\n\u201cWe are being very vigilant,\u201d she said.", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": "Caitlin Dickerson and Jeffrey Gettleman", "type": "article"}
