But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on American-Iraqi relations at a critical stage in the fighting.\n\n\u201cMy brothers in Iraq\u2019s Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,\u201d Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?\u201d\n\nThe order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects.\n\nDuring the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \u201cIt is totally inconsistent.\u201d\n\nIraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada al-Sadr, the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of \u201carrogance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSo get out U.S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U.S.,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nTo contain the political damage, officials said a long-planned call between Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order.\n\nIraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it.\n\nYet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.\n\n\u201cThe people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,\u201d said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq.\n\nSenators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training.\n\n\u201cThis executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,\u201d they wrote in a statement issued Sunday.\n\nThe more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,\u201d said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \u201cThe policies validate the terrorists\u2019 claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael R.
