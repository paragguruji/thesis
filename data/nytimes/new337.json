But it is unclear who, exactly, will be targeted for the extra scrutiny since Mr. Tillerson\u2019s cables leave that decision up to security officers at each embassy.\n\nStill, taken together, consular officials and immigration advocates said the administration\u2019s moves will increase the likelihood of denial for those seeking to come to America, and will further slow down a bureaucratic approval process that can already take months or even years for those flagged for extra investigation. In 2016, the United States issued more than 10 million visas.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons someone might be targeted, such as evidence of a connection to terrorism or crime. But advocates also said they worry about people being profiled for extra scrutiny because of their name or nationality.\n\n\u201cThis will certainly slow down the screening process and impose a substantial burden on these applicants,\u201d said Greg Chen, the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt will make it much harder and create substantial delays.\u201d\n\nThe cables from Mr. Tillerson, which were reported by Reuters, make clear that the Trump administration wants a more intense focus on the potential for a serious threat when making decisions about who should receive a visa.\n\n\u201cConsular officers should not hesitate to refuse any case presenting security concerns,\u201d Mr. Tillerson wrote in the cables, titled \u201cImplementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of Visa Applications.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAll visa decisions are national security decisions,\u201d the secretary of state added.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to properly screen people coming into the United States, a claim former officials in that administration reject. As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to ban all incoming Muslims until leaders could \u201cfigure out what the hell is going on.\u201d Later, he backed away from a total ban on Muslims but promised \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of those trying to come to the United States.\n\nThe president\u2019s first attempt to put tougher screening in place was the executive order aimed at temporarily blocking refugees and people whom Mr. Trump called \u201cbad dudes\u201d from predominantly Muslim countries. Courts blocked the first version of the president\u2019s order after a chaotic rollout just days into his term. A second order was blocked this month.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said the steps aim \u201cto more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nMost people seeking entry to the United States, for family, business or tourism reasons, must apply for a visa. Embassy officials can deny a visa for anyone suspected of being a threat, conducting fraud or planning to stay longer than allowed.\n\nThe seven-page unclassified cable that Mr. Tillerson sent on March 15, which was provided to The New York Times, makes clear that the process of securing an entry visa is about to get harder and longer at diplomatic posts around the globe.\n\n\u201cConsular chiefs must immediately convene post\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence community partners\u201d to develop what Mr. Tillerson described in the cable as \u201csets of post-applicant populations warranting increased scrutiny.\u201d\n\nPeople targeted for increased scrutiny, Mr. Tillerson said in his cable, may be subject to a decision made only after more rigorous screening.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe March 15 cable suggests areas of inquiry during a required interview, including: the applicant\u2019s travel history, addresses and work history for 15 years; and all phone numbers, email addresses and social media handles used by the applicant in the past five years.\n\nAnother cable, sent two days later, indicated that consular officers should not begin asking for the 15-year travel and work histories until the State Department received authorization for those questions from the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear why that permission had not been granted.\n\nThe State Department also urged its embassy officials to delay or reschedule interviews if an applicant was unable to provide all of the information demanded. And Mr. Tillerson acknowledged in the cables that the extra scrutiny would cause \u201cbacklogs to rise,\u201d even as he recommended that officials should each interview no more than 120 visa applicants each day.\n\nMr. Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, questioned how a single interviewer who conducts 120 interviews per day \u2014 at about five minutes per interview \u2014 could improve security for the visa process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely they could obtain information that demonstrates whether someone is a national security threat in such a brief interview process,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the new security protocols for embassies, the four diplomatic cables sent last week offer a view into how the administration hopes to enact the travel ban if the president ever gets the chance.\n\nThe March 15 cable, which was sent before federal courts blocked the revised travel ban, increases scrutiny on people from the six countries in the president\u2019s executive order: Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Libya. It also includes a section calling for increased scrutiny for Iraqi nationals.\n\nFor those from the six countries covered in the ban, the cable envisions a process for potentially granting a limited number of exemptions from the ban by issuing a waiver, but only after vigorous screening. Those people would be questioned about their past 15 years of travel and occupational history, as well as whether they have visited territory controlled by the Islamic State.\n\nA March 16 cable suspended \u201call enforcement\u201d regarding the tougher scrutiny on the countries from Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.", "authors": ["Michael D.
