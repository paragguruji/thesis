A 4-to-4 tie would leave the appeals court ruling in place. It would take five votes to overturn the ruling, and it is unlikely that Mr. Trump could obtain the vote of any of the court\u2019s four more liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump could also try to file a more conventional petition seeking review of the appeals court\u2019s ruling. That would be more orderly, and it would allow the parties to file detailed briefs attacking and defending the appeals court\u2019s reasoning.\n\nIt takes only four votes for the Supreme Court to agree to hear a case this way. Under its ordinary practices, though, a decision on whether to hear the case would probably not come until April, and arguments would not be scheduled until October.\n\nBy then, the Supreme Court may be back at full strength if Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, is confirmed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The administration could urge the court to do that.\n\nWere the Ninth Circuit to agree, the case would ordinarily be heard by an 11-member panel, including the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. The court has a liberal reputation, but its judges have a wide variety of ideological leanings, and it is at least possible that such a panel would rule for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut this strategy also requires time, and the case would still probably end up in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe administration has a second option in the Ninth Circuit. It could continue to litigate the case before the three-judge panel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe panel on Thursday set a schedule for submitting briefs in the underlying appeal. (Recall that the question decided on Thursday was whether to stay the trial court order and not whether it was correct.) The last of those briefs is due March 29.\n\nMore proceedings in the trial court\n\nJudge James L. Robart, who entered the temporary restraining order, has also set a briefing schedule, on whether he should make his ruling more permanent by issuing a preliminary injunction. The last of those briefs is due Feb. 17.\n\nIf the administration were inclined to submit additional evidence justifying the ban, the trial court would be the place to do it. But it is not clear whether there will be further proceedings before Judge Robart on whether he should issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn Thursday, just after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, a lawyer for Washington State wrote a letter to Judge Robart saying the appeals court had effectively entered the preliminary injunction.\n\n\u201cIn light of the court of appeals decision,\u201d Noah G. Purcell, Washington State\u2019s solicitor general, wrote, \u201cthe states assume the district court briefing schedule is no longer applicable. The states will not be filing a preliminary injunction motion and brief in the district court tonight, unless we receive contrary guidance from the district court.\u201d\n\nMany federal trial judges around the country have also addressed aspects of the travel ban, and Mr. Trump won a notable victory in Boston last week. But unless the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling is overturned or modified, the nationwide injunction issued by Judge Robart will stay in place.\n\nStarting from scratch\n\nFinally, the administration could issue a narrower executive order on a travel ban. It would probably be promptly challenged in court.", "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
