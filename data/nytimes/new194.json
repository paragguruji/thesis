It was actually Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, who signed a 2015 law imposing tighter visa restrictions on foreigners who have traveled to Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan within the last five years.\n\nBut the policy, which took effect in January 2016, includes exceptions for people who have visited those countries for business, government, humanitarian or journalistic reasons, so it is not clear why Mr. Bondevik was stopped.\n\nMr. Bondevik said he could understand the need for safety precautions, but he was dismayed at the length of his wait. He notified the Norwegian ambassador in Washington of his concerns.\n\n\u201cThe explanation alone should be more than enough to let me pass,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely they can\u2019t seriously believe that a former prime minister of Norway has sinister intentions\u201d or is \u201cplanning to perform misdeeds in the U.S.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Oslo confirmed that Mr. Bondevik holds a diplomatic passport and that Mr. Bondevik had been in touch with the ministry about this matter, but he declined to comment further on the incident.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In an interview with Norwegian television, he urged the American government not to damage the image of the United States, and he described Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban as overly broad and as frightening.\n\nNorway, the home of the Nobel Peace Prize, has a long history of protecting refugees, and Mr. Trump\u2019s 120-day ban on refugee admissions \u2014 and an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees \u2014 has been widely criticized in Norway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the signals from the Trump administration,\u201d the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, Borge Brende, told the newspaper VG this week. \u201cNorway\u2019s position is clear, refugees must be treated equal regardless of religion, nationality and the color of their skin.\u201d\n\nIn comments on the website of the newspaper VG, Norwegians expressed shock at the treatment of Mr. Bondevik.\n\n\u201cHow can it take an hour to ask some questions?\u201d asked Morten Milsem. Henning Kilseth said it was \u201ctotally ridiculous to be suspicious of a former Norwegian prime minister.\u201d\n\nOle Edvard Antonsen noted Mr. Bondevik\u2019s work as a Christian minister and asked whether the United States had become \u201ca nation built on fear.\u201d\n\nMr. Bondevik was prime minister from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2001 to 2005. Along with the conference associated with the National Prayer Breakfast, he was in Washington for other meetings. As a result of the questioning, he said, he ran late.", "authors": ["Henrik Pryser Libell"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["stopped", "iran", "dulles", "expremier", "airport", "bondevik", "ban", "visit", "refugees", "united", "trumps", "prime", "states", "norwegian", "mr", "minister"], "summary": "Mr. Bondevik\u2019s wait at the airport, which was first reported by the Washington-area news outlet WJLA, has gotten widespread attention in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel policy.\nIt was actually Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, who signed a 2015 law imposing tighter visa restrictions on foreigners who have traveled to Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan within the last five years.\nMr. Bondevik said he could understand the need for safety precautions, but he was dismayed at the length of his wait.\nMr. Bondevik, in the interview, said he had traveled to the United States in January 2016, with the Iranian visa in his passport, without incident.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cI am concerned about the signals from the Trump administration,\u201d the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, Borge Brende, told the newspaper VG this week."}
