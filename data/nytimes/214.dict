Bush could take vigorous, perhaps extreme, measures to protect the nation after the Sept. 11 attacks, including invading Afghanistan, opening the Guant\u00e1namo detention center and conducting military trials and enhanced interrogation of terrorist leaders. Likewise, I supported President Barack Obama when he drew on this source of constitutional power for drone attacks and foreign electronic surveillance.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

(Judge Neil M. Gorsuch will not see this as part of his job description.) In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump did not acknowledge that his highest responsibility, as demanded by his oath of office, is to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\u201d Instead, he declared his duty to represent the wishes of the people and end \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d seemingly without any constitutional restraint.\n\nWhile my robust vision of the presidency supports some of Mr. Trump\u2019s early executive acts \u2014 presidents have the power to terminate international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example \u2014 others are more dubious. Take his order to build a wall along the border with Mexico, and his suggestion that he will tax Mexican imports or currency transfers to pay for it. The president has no constitutional authority over border control, which the Supreme Court has long found rests in the hands of Congress. Under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress can fund the construction of a wall, a fence or even a walking path along the border. And the president cannot slap a tax or tariff on Mexican imports without Congress.\n\nNor can Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, because Congress made the deal with Mexico and Canada by statute. Presidents have no authority to cancel tariff and trade laws unilaterally.\n\nImmigration has driven Mr. Trump even deeper into the constitutional thickets. Even though his executive order halting immigration from seven Muslim nations makes for bad policy, I believe it falls within the law. But after the order was issued, his adviser Rudolph Giuliani disclosed that Mr. Trump had initially asked for \u201ca Muslim ban,\u201d which would most likely violate the Constitution\u2019s protection for freedom of religion or its prohibition on the state establishment of religion, or both \u2014 no mean feat. Had Mr. Trump taken advantage of the resources of the executive branch as a whole, not just a few White House advisers, he would not have rushed out an ill-conceived policy made vulnerable to judicial challenge.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, for her stated intention not to defend his immigration policy, also raises concerns. Even though the constitutional text is silent on the issue, long historical practice and Supreme Court precedent have recognized a presidential power of removal. Mr. Trump was thus on solid footing, because attorneys general have a duty to defend laws and executive orders, so long as they have a plausible legal grounding. But the White House undermined its valid use of the removal power by accusing Ms. Yates of being \u201cweak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d Such irrelevant ad hominem accusations suggest a misconception of the president\u2019s authority of removal.\n\nA successful president need not have a degree in constitutional law. But he should understand the Constitution\u2019s grant of executive power. He should share Hamilton\u2019s vision of an energetic president leading the executive branch in a unified direction, rather than viewing the government as the enemy. He should realize that the Constitution channels the president toward protecting the nation from foreign threats, while cooperating with Congress on matters at home.\n\nOtherwise, our new president will spend his days overreacting to the latest events, dissipating his political capital and haphazardly wasting the executive\u2019s powers.", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "John Yoo", "type": "article"}
