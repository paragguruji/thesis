But the executive order \u2014 which this week was struck down by a second federal court and seems headed to the Supreme Court this summer \u2014 has another important part: a reduction, by more than half, of refugee admissions, to 50,000 from 110,000. This provision is bad for the country for security and economic reasons. As discussed in a forthcoming report by the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, it also potentially violates international commitments and American laws.\n\nYears ago, United States refugee admissions were based on geographic and ideological preferences \u2014 specifically, for refugees from Communist countries and repressive regimes in the Middle East. The Refugee Act of 1980, first introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, was intended to create a more systematic and equitable process for admitting refugees. The act changed the definition of refugee to a person with a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d \u2014 and in that way, conformed United States law to United Nations conventions and protocols.\n\nThe act affirms that it is \u201cthe historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands,\u201d including caring for them in asylum areas and promoting opportunities for resettlement. While a previous shutdown of all Syrian refugees resettlement was dropped from Mr. Trump\u2019s revised executive order, a 120-day moratorium on all refugee admissions remains. This leaves vetted refugees in dangerous and uncertain conditions \u2014 seemingly in violation of the opening declaration of the Refugee Act.\n\nThe law also requires presidents to consult with Congress in setting annual targets for refugee admissions. This consultation must take place before the start of the fiscal year. The only exception to changing this determination is to increase admissions in the face of a refugee emergency, also with appropriate congressional consultation. Given that the fiscal year 2017 quotas were set at 110,000 by President Obama, in consultation with Congress, it exceeds President Trump\u2019s authority to unilaterally change the number set by his predecessor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe process of setting admissions has now begun for fiscal year 2018, which begins in October, with the recent submission to Congress of the president\u2019s budget. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires this process to include a comprehensive proposal and report from the president regarding refugee and resettlement activity, and in-person discussions with the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress this fall. As the Harvard report explains, the president\u2019s executive order would seem to violate the immigration law by prematurely and unilaterally reducing the refugee cap. It also disregards the law\u2019s call for extending \u201cspecial humanitarian concerns\u201d to refugee populations \u2014 language that would support enhancing emergency allocations for Syrian refugees rather than decreasing the number of admissions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees are the precursors to the Refugee Act. They eliminated criteria that limited refugee status to people from certain locations and to events predating 1951. As a signatory to these acts, the United States is bound by their key principles: to not discriminate based on country of origin; to not penalize refugees for illegally entering or staying in the country; and to not expel refugees against their will to a territory where they may be threatened.", "authors": ["Georgette F.
