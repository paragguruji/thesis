So he was predictably quick to sound off in triumph after the Supreme Court announced on Monday morning that in October it would consider the legality of his revised travel ban and will allow the ban to take partial effect in the meantime. The justices\u2019 decision, he said, was \u201ca clear victory for our national security.\u201d\n\nIn reality, \u201cvictory\u201d for anyone in this case is far from clear.\n\nMr. Trump, who had called during the campaign for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d issued his first travel ban in January, but it was quickly blocked by the courts.\n\nA revised version, issued in March, barred visitors from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days and suspended the refugee program for 120 days. Key parts of it were again struck down by two federal appeals courts. One of the two courts, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, recalled Mr. Trump\u2019s own incendiary campaign statements in ruling that the order violated the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion and that it \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the justices agreed to review both appellate decisions, but their unsigned opinion did not address the merits of those cases. They ruled that until they hear the case in early fall, the ban will apply only to foreigners with no connections to America and not to those \u201cwho have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d here.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship? It\u2019s a good question, and one that will be litigated aggressively over the summer. The court provided general guidelines \u2014 say, a family member of someone living in the country, a student admitted to a university or a worker with an employment offer in hand. Relationships that exist only to get around the ban are not acceptable \u2014 for example, between refugees and the immigrant-rights groups that reach out to them as potential clients.\n\nThat approach did not satisfy Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who argued in partial dissent that the \u201cbona fide\u201d standard was \u201cunworkable\u201d and will result in a \u201cflood of litigation\u201d in the lower federal courts. The dissenters would have allowed the ban to take effect in its entirety.\n\nAll the legal jockeying shouldn\u2019t obscure the fundamental foolishness of the policy itself. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s groundless claim that the ban is necessary to protect national security, no one from the affected countries has been responsible for a fatal terror attack in the United States in the past two decades. This includes the past five months, during which the White House has repeatedly insisted on the ban\u2019s importance even as it has shown little urgency in filing its appeals.\n\nNow the administration has the summer to conduct its vetting review, which was the original rationale for the travel ban \u2014 the government needed time to \u201cfigure out what is going on,\u201d as Mr. Trump once put it. By October, the ban will have expired and the review should be complete. And by then Mr. Trump might conceivably have developed a factual basis for a policy that continues to bar people from certain countries, which would trigger a whole new round of litigation.\n\nRelated Coverage Supreme Court Takes Up Travel Ban Case, and Allows Parts to Go Ahead Image\n\nSign up for the Opinion Today newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.
