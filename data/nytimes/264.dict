In the process of doing their jobs, they sometimes have to check the authority of another branch.\n\nFor this activity, students, working in pairs, should look through a recent print edition of The Times or scan nytimes.com to find examples of articles (not Opinion pieces) reporting on the three branches of the federal government and the various ways they provide a check and balance to each other. Students can use this activity sheet to record what they find.\n\nHere are some examples of articles related to checks and balances just from the first few weeks of the new Trump administration:\n\n\u2022 Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court\n\n\u2022 Two G.O.P. Senators to Oppose DeVos as Education Secretary, Imperiling Her Confirmation\n\n\u2022 Trump Says \u2018Go Nuclear\u2019 as Democrats Gird for Gorsuch Fight\n\n\u2022 Trump Clashes Early With Courts, Portending Years of Legal Battles\n\n\u2022 Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump\u2019s Travel Ban\n\nOnce they find an article, students should take notes on the following:\n\n\u2022 What is the article\u2019s headline?\n\n\u2022 Write a brief summary of the article.\n\n\u2022 What example(s) of checks and balances does this article report? What branch is currently being checked, or might be checked in the future, and why?\n\nThen, the class can share the various examples cited and discuss what each example reveals about how well our system of checks and balances works.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStudents can also look at the relationship between the White House and Congress, now that both the executive and legislative branches are controlled by the same party. How much should the American people expect a Republican Congress to hold a Republican president accountable if his actions or policies cross the line?\n\nFor example this editorial argues that it\u2019s time for Congress to investigate, based on currently breaking news stories about the relationship between members of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian officials. What do you think Congress\u2019s role should be?\n\nAdditional questions students can consider about the U.S.\u2019s system of checks and balances include:\n\n\u2022 To what extent is it clouded by politics?\n\n\u2022 Is it effective at stopping overreaches of power?\n\n\u2022 Is it fair and reliable?\n\nPart II: Consider the Value of a Free Press as a \u201cFourth Branch\u201d of Government\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the federal government only includes three branches, students can consider the role a free press plays in our system of checks and balances. In fact, the press is sometimes referred to as the \u201cfourth branch\u201d of government. Ask students: Why is the news media so important in helping to maintain the balance of power in the American political system?\n\nTo emphasize the value of the press, you might invite students to work in pairs or groups with a recent New York Times front page. Ask them, what articles or images from that day\u2019s front page would probably not be published in a country without a law guaranteeing freedom of the press? Then, invite them to take a marker and draw an X over each of those.\n\nTo push the discussions a bit further, students might use our \u201cCensoring the Press\u201d handout before small groups share their ideas. You could even do this activity over the course of a week and create a gallery of such pages.\n\nOr, use this 63-page New York Times Curriculum Guide on Checks and Balances (PDF), which includes three lesson plans on the importance of a free press, as well as additional lessons and student handouts relating to our system of checks and balances.\n\nThen, invite students to investigate President Trump\u2019s relationship with the role of the free press.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his first full day in office, Mr. Trump called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth.\u201d His chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, stated, \u201cThe media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhat other evidence of the relationship between the press and the president can students find? For instance, why does the Mr. Trump call CNN and other mainstream news outlets, \u201cfake news\u201d?\n\nRead the Op-Ed \u201cDon\u2019t Expect the First Amendment to Protect the Media\u201d by the law professors RonNell Andersen Jones and Sonja R. West. Why do they think Americans should be worried about the power of the news media during the Trump administration? Do you agree? Have actions by the Trump White House supported or undermined their central claim?\n\n_________\n\nPart III: Investigate President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile students might be familiar with the concept that Congress makes the laws and the president enforces them, they might be confused by the concept of an executive order. It\u2019s not a presidential power typically emphasized in school textbooks.\n\nWith President Trump\u2019s executive orders making headlines at the start of his new administration, students may want to know, how does this action fit into the system of separation of powers?\n\nThe American Bar Association defines an executive order as:\n\nAn executive order is a signed, written, and published directive from the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.\n\nIn other words, the president is defining the details of how he will enforce the law as already written. To give one example, Congress might declare war on another nation, but the president as Commander in Chief has broad authority in determining how to wage that war. The same principle is true for Congressional laws on anything else \u2014 for example, education, energy policy or immigration.\n\nThe bar association\u2019s explanation continues:\n\nExecutive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect.\n\nPresident Trump is not unique in issuing a flurry of executive orders in his first days in office. President Obama acted similarly. And neither is it unique for an opposition party to criticize a president\u2019s use of executive orders to make policy. Republicans continually criticized President Obama for his use of executive orders, calling him a dictator who abused his power. In 2012, Donald Trump even scolded Mr. Obama for using executive orders to make \u201cmajor power grabs of authority.\u201d\n\nEven though the president has the power to issue executive orders that have the force of law, the president must always cite what specific laws \u2014 or the Constitution itself \u2014 grant him the authority to issue his order. In addition, these orders are reviewable by the federal courts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo learn more about how the president sets policy using executive orders, students can visit the Federal Register. All executive orders, by law, must be published in the Federal Register (the list includes presidential memorandums and proclamations as well). Working in pairs, students can pick an executive action Mr. Trump has taken and determine the following:\n\n\u2022 What policy change is the president ordering the federal government to make? (Students might find some of the legal jargon challenging, but they can still try to figure out what policy change the president is making.)\n\n\u2022 What authority does the president cite for issuing this executive order? (President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order in 1962 that requires all executive orders to contain a citation of the authority under which it is issued. Executive orders generally begin with the phrase \u201cBy the authority vested in me as President of the United States by\u2026\u201d)\n\n\u2022 By searching in The New York Times, Google News and other sources what can you find out about how the public and the media reacted to the executive order? Did it make headlines? What has been the reception? Is it being challenged in any way via the system of checks and balances?\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s your personal reaction to the executive order? Does it seem important? Does it seem like good public policy?\n\nPairs can share what they learned through their research and discuss their opinions of these presidential actions.\n\n_________\n\nPart IV: Evaluating the Relationship Between the President and the Judiciary\n\nVideo\n\nOne of the most important checks on a president\u2019s authority is the judicial branch\u2019s power to review the constitutionality of executive actions. The power of judicial review, affirmed by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison in 1803, came into full public view in early February when first a federal district judge, and then a federal appeals court, suspended Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven largely-Muslim nations and halting the immigration of all refugees to the U.S.\n\nStudents can watch Judge James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle deliver his opinion in the five-minute video above, and then discuss what they noticed about his justification for suspending the president\u2019s executive order, including how he described his role within our system of checks and balances.\n\nPresident Trump is not the first president to have his policy actions stymied by the courts. President Obama was publicly disappointed when the courts blocked his executive order aiming to shield as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt criticized the Supreme Court when it blocked parts of his New Deal program during the Great Depression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut President Trump\u2019s public contempt for the judicial branch and his denigration of specific judges who hand down rulings unfavorable to him seem to be breaking new ground in the relationship between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nPeter Baker reports in The Times:\n\nPresident Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power.\n\nThe article continues:\n\nLawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances. Late in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to pre-emptively blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack.\n\nStudents should take notes while listening to this NPR story (the \u201cplay\u201d button is on the top left of the article) pointing out that Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of judges and the judiciary is out of line with past presidents. Then they should consider the following questions:\n\n\u2022 Is President Trump promoting a lack of respect for the court system with his comments?\n\n\u2022 Are Mr. Trump\u2019s public statements about judges and the judiciary branch weakening our system of checks and balances? Why or why not?\n\n\u2022 Or, should his statements not be taken so seriously?\n\n\u2022 Has more recent news continued Mr. Trump\u2019s strained relationship with the judicial branch? Explain.\n\nAfter writing about or discussing the above questions, students can imagine they are a legal adviser to President Trump. What advice would they give the president about how our system of checks and balances is supposed to work, and what role he as president should have within that system.\n\nPhoto\n\nFinally, students can create their own editorial cartoons, like the one above by Patrick Chappatte, about any of the topics discussed in this lesson. They can even submit it to our annual editorial cartoon contest (see our contest calendar for details).\n\n_________\n\nRelated Teaching Materials from The New York Times\n\nEvaluating Trump\u2019s Nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: A Lesson Plan\n\nAnalyzing Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban: A Lesson Plan\n\nEvaluating Sources in a \u2018Post-Truth\u2019 World: Ideas for Teaching and Learning About Fake News\n\nThe Inauguration of a New President: A Lesson Plan on Predicting and Evaluating the First 100 Days of a Trump White House\n\nChecks and Balances: Teaching American Government and Law With The New York Times", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "authors": "Michael Gonchar", "type": "article"}
