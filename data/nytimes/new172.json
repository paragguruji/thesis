Leader Says Trump Visa Bans \u2018Violate Our Basic Principles\u2019", "text": "Mr. Guterres is under enormous pressure. On the one hand, he must speak out against discrimination, in keeping with the rules enshrined in international conventions. On the other, he needs to avoid alienating the president of the United States, which is the United Nations\u2019 biggest financial backer.\n\nMr. Guterres declined to comment about the White House\u2019s reported threats to cut financial support to the United Nations, saying he did not want to prejudge what has not yet been announced. \u201cWhen you talk too much about things that have not happened, you trigger the happening of those things,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he had held \u201ca very constructive discussion\u201d with the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R.

The organization\u2019s top human rights official, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, said in a Twitter post this week that Mr. Trump\u2019s order flouted international law.\n\nOn Wednesday, five independent human rights experts for the United Nations also criticized the Trump administration in a statement that described the new American policy as a discriminatory action that had stigmatized Muslim communities.\n\nThe countries affected by Mr. Trump\u2019s order are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Guterres, in his comments on Wednesday, also warned of a backlash.\n\n\u201cWhen we adopt measures that spread anxiety and anger,\u201d he said, \u201cwe help trigger the kind of recruitment mechanism that these organizations are doing everywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nLegal experts say the executive order could collide with international law. It is already facing numerous legal challenges in American courts.\n\nNo country is legally obliged to provide resettlement to refugees, and every country has the sovereign right to decide who is admitted into its territory. But the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty that came into force in 1976, prohibits a country from passing laws that discriminate on the basis of religion or national origin. James C. Hathaway, a University of Michigan law professor, argued that the United States therefore cannot limit resettlement based on religion or national origin.\n\nAdditionally, laws governing the rights of refugees prohibit sending people back to countries where they could face persecution.\n\nIn a post on the legal site Just Security, Mr. Hathaway called Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cwillfully blind\u201d to the United States\u2019 obligation under that law.", "authors": ["Somini Sengupta"], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["principles", "international", "trump", "violate", "order", "united", "states", "nations", "trumps", "rights", "law", "leader", "bans", "guterres", "basic", "mr", "visa"], "summary": "On the other, he needs to avoid alienating the president of the United States, which is the United Nations\u2019 biggest financial backer.\nHe said he had held \u201ca very constructive discussion\u201d with the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R.
