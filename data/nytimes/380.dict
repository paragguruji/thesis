The Florida Republican supported the measure and has played an influential role in shaping the new Cuba policy.\n\n\u201cIt is my duty to advocate for the issues that are important to my constituents, and I will not apologize for using every available avenue to effectively resolve them,\u201d Mr. Diaz-Balart said in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Such a restriction could have far-reaching consequences for existing deals, such as the one struck by Starwood Hotels and Resorts last year to manage hotels in Cuba \u2014 one of which is owned by the military conglomerate Gaviota \u2014 and effectively freeze future ones, since the military in Cuba has a hand in virtually every element of the economy.\n\n\u201cThis is a return to the old playbook of creating ambiguity and uncertainty so that nobody knows what is permissible and what isn\u2019t, and it would add another level of legal exposure to doing business in Cuba,\u201d said Robert L. Muse, a Washington lawyer who specializes in American law regarding Cuba. \u201cIt would add one more obstacle to the obstacle course, which is already pretty complex.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, according to people close to the discussions, is also considering tightening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba that were eased last year on the eve of Mr. Obama\u2019s historic trip to Havana. The new policy allows Americans who are making educational or cultural trips to Cuba to initiate their own travel there without special permission from the United States government and without a licensed tour company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReversing it, or intensifying enforcement to require travelers to show evidence that their trips are legal, would probably slow the recent influx of American tourism to Cuba to a trickle, leaving airlines that have started direct flights there with fewer customers to serve.\n\nAnd the president is weighing an increase in funding for the United States Agency for International Development for programs that promote democracy in Cuba, initiatives that the Castro government has long condemned as covert efforts to overthrow it.\n\nThe changes are far more limited than those sought by Cuba hard-liners, who have pressed Mr. Trump to reimpose all the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration and cut off diplomatic relations unless Cuba, a military dictatorship, quickly schedules democratic elections, institutes an independent judiciary and shows progress on settling American financial claims and returning American fugitives to the United States.\n\nForged in secret by Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides along with senior officials in the government of President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba during more than a year of clandestine talks, the official thaw between the United States and Cuba began with a surprise announcement in December 2014 and was then followed by a series of diplomatic and regulatory changes designed to be difficult to unravel.\n\nAt a high-level meeting on the policy changes led by the National Security Council in May, officials from a wide array of agencies said they supported continuing the aspects of the policy that pertained to their departments, people familiar with the discussion said, as Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative affairs operation, which tracks the president\u2019s private commitments to lawmakers, made the case for changes.\n\nWithout a consensus, an announcement that had initially been anticipated on May 20, Cuban Independence Day, never materialized. A White House official said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has yet to receive any recommendations for how to move forward, and while he would like to announce his new policy in June, there is no guarantee that he will do so, and no milestone date driving the process.\n\nIn seeking to justify his changes on human rights grounds, Mr. Trump would be taking an approach far different from the one he has applied to other parts of the world, where he and his advisers have viewed human rights considerations as an impediment to trade and partnerships that create jobs in the United States.\n\n\u201cGiven their complete lack of concern for human rights around the world, it would be a tragic irony if the Trump administration uses that to justify policies that harm the Cuban people and restrict the freedom of Americans to travel and do business where they please,\u201d said Benjamin Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama who negotiated the 2014 announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Cuban and American people want to move forward, and nothing can change that reality.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-31", "authors": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "type": "article"}
