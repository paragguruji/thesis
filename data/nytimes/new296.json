Reaction to the new restrictions seems destined to reprise that to Mr. Trump\u2019s original order in January, and it echoes the Butcher\u2019s oft-quoted line from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry VI, Part 2.\u201d There is a crucial one-word change, though. This version goes: \u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s call all the lawyers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what opponents of the travel ban did in January. In short order, legal teams formed to represent immigrants who were suddenly detained at airports, with nowhere to go. Their challenge to presidential authority was sustained by federal judges, and their motivation underpins this short video from Retro Report, a documentary series that mines the past for guidance as to what may lie ahead. The focus is on a network of current and former students at Yale Law School who helped draft a legal petition that became part of the pushback that stopped the first Trump order in its tracks.\n\nFor Michael J. Wishnie, a Yale law professor involved in that effort, what happened in January was familiar. \u201cIt was very much a replay of what I had seen,\u201d he told Retro Report.\n\nAs a Yale law student in 1991, Professor Wishnie was part of a team that worked on behalf of Haitians who had fled their country by boat after a coup there. They sought asylum in the United States, but instead were sent to the American naval base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and held behind barbed wire. Ultimately, a federal judge ordered that more than 150 Haitians be released and allowed to enter the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, as now, there were fears in this country that the migrants presented a threat. Nonetheless, \u201cthere have to be rules, and there have to be limits,\u201d said Lisa Daugaard, a 1992 graduate of Yale Law School who is the director of the Public Defender Association, a nonprofit group based in Seattle. And \u201cif the executive agencies are not willing to observe the limits themselves,\u201d Ms. Daugaard said, it falls to the courts to sort things out.\n\nFrom statements issued on Monday after the president\u2019s new order was announced, it appeared that various groups were prepared to call all the lawyers once again. The members of the Yale group said they were ready. They have support from one of their more prominent professors, Harold Hongju Koh, who was involved in the 1990s effort to help Haitian refugees and who was the State Department\u2019s legal adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.", "authors": ["Clyde Haberman", "Retro Report"], "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "yale", "trump", "fighting", "ban", "retro", "1991", "echoes", "wishnie", "united", "trumps", "group", "school", "order", "law", "short", "legal"], "summary": "This version goes: \u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s call all the lawyers.\u201dThat\u2019s what opponents of the travel ban did in January.\nIn short order, legal teams formed to represent immigrants who were suddenly detained at airports, with nowhere to go.\nFor Michael J.
