Ms. Damond, 40, who was from Sydney and who also went by the name Justine Ruszczyk, was engaged to be married to an American man, according to Australian news reports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey were so in love,\u201d said Matt Omo, a close friend and a founder of his own wellness practice in Australia, who often collaborated with Ms. Damond on meditation and personal development workshops. He called her death a tragedy. \u201cHow could such a beautiful soul with only the desire to help people be shot dead by the police?\u201d he asked.\n\nHere\u2019s our coverage of the incident.\n\n[1:34 p.m.]\n\n\u2018I Wonder if She Could Say the Same of Him\u2019\n\nEvery so often, even the most steeled, line-toeing politicians will have a moment of authenticity crack through carefully crafted rhetoric.\n\nOn the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s \u201cInsiders\u201d on Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was asked how she would react if President Trump told her, as he told the wife of President Emmanuel Macron of France, that she was in \u201cgood shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be taken aback, I think. It\u2019s a rather interesting comment to make,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder if she could say the same of him.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As foreign minister, she has consistently made statements supporting Mr. Trump. \u201cWe share a common view on many issues, so we will continue to work very closely with the Trump administration,\u201d Ms. Bishop said in January.\n\nMr. Trump has regularly commented on the appearances of women while president. Last month, speaking on the phone with the new prime minister of Ireland, he interrupted his conversation to remark that a female Irish journalist \u201chas a nice smile on her face.\u201d\n\nHis comments about France\u2019s first lady were met with concern and ridicule over the weekend, especially on American late-night television.\n\n\u201cOnly Donald Trump,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel said, \u201cwould treat a meeting with a world leader like it\u2019s a swingers\u2019 key party or something.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has not yet responded to the criticism \u2014 or to Ms. Bishop\u2019s retort.\n\n[9:40 a.m.]", "publish_date": "2017-07-16", "authors": "Adam Baidawi and Isabella Kwai", "type": "article"}
