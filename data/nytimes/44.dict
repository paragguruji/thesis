She said strangers had begun taunting her to speak English or leave.\n\nClaudia Martinez, who is Mexican-American, Catholic and a devoted Republican, said she had wept in anguish after voting for Mrs. Clinton. But choosing Mr. Trump was not an option.\n\n\u201cIf he said those things as a candidate, what will he say as president?\u201d she asked.\n\nDemocrats had seen Latinos as a path to victory in states like Nevada and Florida, where they grew this year to 19 percent of the electorate, from 17 percent in 2012. But while turnout swelled in Miami and in the central Florida counties where Puerto Ricans have settled, and Latinos supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by 63 percent to 34 percent, the mainly white voters in Florida who flocked to Mr. Trump surpassed the Latino numbers for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDown ballot, there were some small victories for anti-Trump Latinos. In Arizona, activists like Ms. Gomez succeeded in ousting Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, the enduring face of the state\u2019s unforgiving stance against illegal immigration.\n\nAnd in Nevada, where Latino turnout also surged, months of intensive turnout efforts by labor unions helped elect Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, to fill the Senate seat of Harry Reid, who is retiring, making her the first Latina in the Senate. They also elected the first Latino congressman from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen, another Democrat. And Mrs. Clinton took that state.\n\nSome Hispanic voters were proud to say they had voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nJohn Santamaria, a Cuban-American real estate agent from Miami, said he thought the Republican candidate\u2019s tough immigration proposals were just talk. \u201cI felt it was red meat for the vote,\u201d Mr. Santamaria said. \u201cThe man is an egotistical maniac, but I hope he can bring the success he had in business to this country.\u201d\n\nBut Claudia Ramos, a Nevada hotel worker from Mexico who has been an American citizen for 10 years, seemed dazed by the results. \u201cWe are scared, and we don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do,\u201d Ms. Ramos said.\n\nBan Worries Muslims\n\nWhen election results on Tuesday night started pointing to a Trump victory, Ibrahim Rashid, a sophomore at Boston University, began getting nervous.\n\nGiven Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to bar Muslims from entering the United States in an attempt to curb terrorism, Mr. Rashid, an American citizen who is Muslim, worried that his family \u2014 Pakistani nationals who live in Dubai \u2014 could never visit him here again. And he ached for a young cousin in Michigan whose classmates were mean to her after Mr. Trump won a mock election at school, prompting her to cry all day.\n\n\u201cAll of us are just scared,\u201d Mr. Rashid said on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk on Facebook about getting ready for the next four years because people are going to question you, and your point of view won\u2019t matter. The feeling is, we\u2019re not accepted any more.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, he did not want his fear to show. And so he boldly dressed in Pakistani clothes and clipped a sign to his shirt that declared, \u201cI\u2019m not Scared.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMuslims across the country were suddenly grappling with the reality of a Trump presidency and trying to calibrate their responses to it \u2014 including worries that Mr. Trump would keep mosques under surveillance and establish a database for all Muslims living in the United States. A recent study puts the number of Muslim Americans at 3.3 million, just over 1 percent of the United States population.\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Rashid\u2019s personal response reflects that of the nation\u2019s organized Muslim groups.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As one person wrote on Twitter: \u201cAs I\u2019m stopped at a gas station this morning, a group of guys yell over: \u2018Time to get out of this country, Apu!\u2019 Day 1.\u201d\n\nAnd another: \u201cMy mom literally just texted me \u2018don\u2019t wear the Hijab please\u2019 and she\u2019s the most religious person in our family. ... \u201d\n\nAt a community advocacy center in Brooklyn, older women in hijabs sat in an English class and shared their fears in a mixture of English, Urdu, Arabic and Bengali.\n\n\u201cThey said to me, \u2018How can America elect such a person who is so openly about hate of others?\u2019 \u201d said Mohammad Razvi, the executive director of the Council of Peoples Organization.\n\nNadeem Mazen, a member of the City Council in Cambridge, Mass., who is deeply involved in Muslim matters, said that local Muslim leaders were \u201cshocked by the outcome\u201d and unprepared to deal with it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all scrambling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take years for us to catch up when we have to spend all our time defending ourselves against hate speech.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018The #Whitelash\u2019\n\nMrs. Clinton spent considerable effort courting black voters. She formed bonds with the mothers of black men who had been killed by the police, giving them a prominent place on stage at the Democratic National Convention. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, served as her most powerful surrogates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. Although black voters overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 88 percent to 8 percent for Mr. Trump nationwide \u2014 the number of black voters who made it to the polls lagged behind the last two presidential elections. As the results came in, black voters reflected on what they meant.\n\n\u201cI just realize that people are more racist, sexist and misogynist than I ever realized,\u201d Johanne Blain, a Haitian-born graduate of Wellesley, said at an alumnae watch party at the college on election night. \u201cToday is kind of like the end of the world.\u201d\n\nNow, black voters are grappling with the idea of a president-elect whose tone, personal history and policy pronouncements fly in the face of so much of the social justice agenda many have fought decades for, including gains made under Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cWhen people say Trump\u2019s presidency will be bad, it\u2019s not theoretical,\u201d DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, said on Twitter. \u201cThis is real life.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Trump presented himself as the antidote to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has protested the killings of black men by the police over the past two years. While young black activists demanded that college campuses curb speech that could be considered offensive to minorities, Mr. Trump railed against \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d While black activists protested police killings and racial profiling, Mr. Trump promised to restore \u201claw and order\u201d and expand New York\u2019s contentious \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing policy nationwide.\n\nFar from ruining Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of being elected, his remarks lay at the heart of his appeal to white voters, who expressed resentment over what they consider political correctness gone overboard.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the #WhiteLash,\u201d Van Jones, a CNN political commentator, said on Twitter, a play on \u201cbacklash.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdding to the disappointment was Mr. Trump\u2019s own history. Once sued by President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s Justice Department for racial discrimination in his family\u2019s housing rentals, Mr. Trump had served as the loudest voice behind the so-called birther movement that spread the false claim that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya, and was thus ineligible for president.\n\nThe celebration of Mr. Trump\u2019s election by far-right groups sent a wave of fear through African-Americans across the country. Social media sites on Wednesday were full of reports of racial slurs that have been hurled by Trump supporters, and of fears of hard-won civil rights being rolled back.\n\n\u201cWe are scared,\u201d Yassir Lester, a black comedian from Los Angeles, said on Twitter.", "publish_date": "2016-11-10", "authors": "Julia Preston, Katharine Q.
