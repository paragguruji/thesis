Passengers, many of them with green cards that allow them to live and work in the United States, were barred from flights into the country. A number of people with visas were suddenly unsure if they would be allowed into the United States, and many were stopped when they arrived.\n\nNeither homeland security nor related agencies posted any information on their websites or social media accounts informing the public about Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban until Sunday.\n\nImmigration proponents and lawyers representing people stuck at airports because of the ban say they were unable to speak to anyone at Customs and Border Protection or at the headquarters of homeland security.\n\nThe first briefing on the order by homeland security officials for the news media was at 9 p.m. on Saturday, long after news reports raised questions about the effects of the order and after thousands of people had lined the sidewalks and terminals of international airports to protest the ban.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the Tuesday briefing, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin K. McAleenan, rejected criticism of the agency\u2019s efforts to enforce the order.\n\n\u201cWe worked quickly to implement, and I think the process has really smoothed out,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kelly also insisted that there was no chaos. \u201cOur officers who are at the counters, so to speak, the only chaos they saw was what was taking place in other parts of the airport,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, Mr. Kelly insisted the country remained open to visitors despite their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Ron Nixon", "type": "article"}
