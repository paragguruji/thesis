The Department of Homeland Security submitted such a rule change for public posting on Thursday morning, and it is set to be published in the federal register on Friday.\n\n\u201cD.H.S. ceased use of Nseers more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,\u201d Neema Hakim, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. The program is \u201cnot only obsolete\u201d and \u201coutdated,\u201d but diverts personnel and resources from other areas that are seen as more effective, the statement said.\n\nSome experts say there is no need for a registry.\n\nOfficials in the agency have long believed that the program has outlived its usefulness. A number of newer programs, developed in the years since the Nseers system was put into place, capture a vast amount of information that allows customs officers to flag for additional questioning people from certain countries or those with unusual travel itineraries.\n\nA 2012 report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said that since 2006, senior officials in the agency had been calling for the termination of the program, and in the report, the inspector general recommended that it be ended. \u201cInformation obtained from fingerprints, flight manifests, travel and identification documents and intelligence sources is more valuable in determining who poses a potential national security risk,\u201d the report said, citing customs and border control officers.\n\n\u201cLeaving the regulatory structure of the Nseers program in place provides no discernible public benefit,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe regulations that are being undone date to 1991, at the time of the first gulf war, when immigration authorities began requiring the registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrant travelers entering the United States from Iraq and Kuwait. The authorities removed the requirements for those countries two years later but retained provisions preserving the attorney general\u2019s power to compel the same information from nonimmigrants from specific countries.\n\nIn 2002, the federal government began the program and required special registration from those arriving from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Syria. By 2003, the list had expanded to 25 countries, most with majority Muslim populations and most in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the move left in place the regulations that allowed for it to be restarted.\n\nIn recent days, dozens of Democratic officials in Washington, as well as the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, have called for the regulations to be rescinded.\n\n\u201cNo known terrorism convictions have resulted from the program,\u201d read a joint letter, dated Dec. 1, from more than 50 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump, said the program was \u201can affront to our core American values of pluralism and equal justice under law.\u201d\n\nFacebook, Microsoft, Google and Apple are among several technology companies that have publicly stated that they would not assist the new administration in developing any program that would collect information that could be used by the government to track immigrants from Muslim countries.\n\nThe technology companies took action after thousands of Silicon Valley engineers signed a pledge saying they stood in solidarity with Muslim Americans and immigrants and would not use their skills for the \u201cnew administration\u2019s proposed data-collection policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe refuse to build a database of people based on their constitutionally protected religious beliefs,\u201d the engineers said in a statement.\n\nMr. Hakim, in his statement, said the regulations had long since been replaced by automated systems and programs that were not in place at the start of the registry program \u2014 which required in-person interviews by federal agents and targeted specific countries.\n\nThe new tools are \u201cfar better equipped to face the evolving landscape of international terrorism,\u201d he said. Those programs include an automated system for collecting and storing biometric data such as fingerprints from nearly all people entering the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe changes are set to take effect immediately after they are published on Friday.", "publish_date": "2016-12-22", "authors": "J.
