The visas were revoked \u201cprovisionally,\u201d according to the memo, and could be reinstated once a new policy is formulated.\n\nBut for now, the loss of their visas means that anyone from those countries who leaves the United States \u2014 even for funerals or family health emergencies \u2014 would be unable to return without getting a new visa, a lengthy process that cannot begin until the Trump administration has completed its review of the visa program.\n\nUnlike the refugee ban, which was announced with much fanfare, the canceled visas came to light only as a result of court filings by government lawyers defending the ban on travelers from the seven countries against litigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump administration officials said they had chosen those seven countries based on concerns expressed by Obama administration officials, who in 2016 required anyone passing through the seven countries to get a visa. But those involved in the Obama administration effort said that the countries had largely been chosen by Congress as part of immigration legislation passed in 2015 and that the visa reviews were intended to catch Islamic State fighters and not to ban or inconvenience all of those countries\u2019 citizens.\n\n\u201cMy parents still live in Iran,\u201d said Mahsa Rouhi, an Iranian who holds a green card and is a research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cMy dad is 82, and if my parents are in need of urgent care, I could face a choice of my job and my life here and caring for my parents. I was advised \u2014 most universities and institutions are advising people in my situation \u2014 not to travel, not to take the risk.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that legal permanent residents from the seven countries, also known as green card holders, would be able to enter the United States without getting special waivers. That was a change from the first days after the issuance of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, when even green card holders from the seven countries were detained at airports, told to leave the United States or forbidden to get on planes to the United States.\n\nYet even after the change, green card holders can be turned away at the border at the discretion of Customs and Border Protection officers, as only United States citizens have an irrevocable right to enter the country.\n\nJust last year, the State Department issued 31,804 immigrant visas to people from the seven countries, according to a State Department tally. Thousands more were granted student and other visas last year, and those have also been revoked. The letter excepted only a few classes of visa holders, mainly diplomats and NATO military personnel, leaving au pairs and businesspeople, athletes and artists, even victims of human trafficking without exemptions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A Canadian citizen born in Iraq, he said he had found so much contradictory information online that he felt his only option was to cancel his travel plans and stay put.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are layers of misinformation,\u201d Mr. Hamandi said. \u201cEmotionally it\u2019s quite devastating.\u201d\n\nIn the hours after the executive order was signed, border officials detained or turned away anyone who was born in or had a passport from one of the seven countries, even those who also had citizenship in countries other than the targeted seven. But after the intervention of British and Canadian diplomats, Trump administration officials agreed to exempt dual-passport holders who presented passports from other countries. Under the new rules, dual citizens can now legally re-enter the United States if they leave, officials said.\n\nAdding to the concern, several green card holders, including Ms. Rouhi, said they had received unexpected notification this week that their Global Entry Trusted Traveler Network status had been revoked.\n\nA spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to address the canceled Global Entry memberships but said that enrollees in the program, which allows approved, low-risk travelers expedited clearance into the United States when they arrive, can be kicked out for a number of reasons, including being inadmissible to the United States under immigration regulations.\n\nAli Vaez, a senior analyst for Iran at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization, said he had learned that his membership in Global Entry was abruptly cut off on Tuesday when he received a message stating, \u201cYou do not meet program eligibility requirements.\u201d Mr. Vaez said that although he had a green card, the sudden revocation of his Global Entry status had caused him to reconsider traveling outside the United States.\n\n\u201cI thought because permanent residents were exempted from this, it was fine, but because my Global Entry status was revoked, I have new concerns,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe rules and regulations are changing by the hour, by the day. There\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Vaez said. With a wife and a house in Washington, he added, \u201cI just can\u2019t risk it.\u201d\n\nMr. Vaez noted that his green card had been granted under the national-interest provision of immigration law and that he has been allowed inside the Pentagon and even the White House Situation Room as part of his work.\n\n\u201cWhat has not been vetted properly is not people like me, it\u2019s this new executive order,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the problem.\u201d", "authors": ["Nicholas Kulish", "Gardiner Harris", "Ron Nixon"], "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["foreigners", "seven", "visas", "state", "immigration", "trapped", "order", "officials", "united", "countries", "green", "states", "policy"], "summary": "That was a change from the first days after the issuance of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, when even green card holders from the seven countries were detained at airports, told to leave the United States or forbidden to get on planes to the United States.\nJust last year, the State Department issued 31,804 immigrant visas to people from the seven countries, according to a State Department tally.\n\u201cBasically, they are trapped without some other measures they would have to take, another application process they would have to go through,\u201d said Doris Meissner, senior fellow and director of the United States immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute and a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nUnder the new rules, dual citizens can now legally re-enter the United States if they leave, officials said.\nA spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to address the canceled Global Entry memberships but said that enrollees in the program, which allows approved, low-risk travelers expedited clearance into the United States when they arrive, can be kicked out for a number of reasons, including being inadmissible to the United States under immigration regulations."}
