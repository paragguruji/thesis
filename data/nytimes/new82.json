If the governments do not comply, they will be given 60 days to do so; failing that, their citizens will be barred from entering the United States.\n\nGovernment reaction to the order has been cautious. But there is little doubt that the demand for information will be a challenge for Iran, which sends far more people to the United States each year, around 35,000, than any other country on the list.\n\nWhile Iran willingly allows its citizens to travel to the United States, it is ideologically opposed to sharing information with Washington. But if it does not, many of its citizens will be cut off from visiting relatives who are among the estimated one million Iranian-Americans living in America.\n\nThe visa ban will provide an early indication of where relations between Tehran and the Trump administration are headed, one analyst said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTrump will regard the Iranian reaction as a test,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, who is close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. \u201cIf Iran doesn\u2019t comply, they won\u2019t do so either on other issues. We will see in 30 days.\u201d\n\nAnother analyst doubted the government would comply with the order.\n\n\u201cWe are not obliged to give information about our citizens to the Trump administration,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, considered a hard-liner. \u201cSuch a move would be unjustifiable.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Americans of Iranian descent expressed shock and dismay at news of Mr. Trump\u2019s impending policy change, and were particularly concerned about their relatives and friends in Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based advocacy group, said many Iranian citizens with valid green cards and American visas were distraught. Those outside the United States are fretting they will not be allowed in, and those already in the country fear they will not be able to leave, even temporarily, because they will be barred from returning.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of bewilderment, as well as a sense of injustice,\u201d over why Iran was even included on the list of targeted countries, Mr. Parsi said. No Iranian has been accused of an attack on the American homeland. By contrast, he said, the Sept. 11 attackers included citizens from countries which are not on the list \u2014 and \u201cthe United States has produced more ISIS fighters than Iran has.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s most popular actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, announced on Twitter that she was canceling her trip to the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Feb. 26, after reports that Mr. Trump was about to sign the sweeping executive order.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She almost certainly could have obtained a visa as a \u2018\u2018culturally unique artist,\u2019\u2019 but said she no longer felt like making the trip.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me or the Academy Awards, it\u2019s about having a discussion about this decision,\u201d Ms. Alidoosti said. \u201cThis is such a bizarre ban, it is uprooting people\u2019s lives in ways not imaginable.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, according to the Department of Homeland Security, a total of 35,266 nonimmigrant visas were granted to Iranians to enter the United States, compared with 21,381 for Iraq; 16,010 for Syria; 5,549 for Yemen; 4,792 for Sudan; 2,879 for Libya and 359 for Somalia.\n\nAs there is no American embassy or consulate in Iran, Iranians must travel to Ankara, Turkey, Dushanbe in Tajikistan or to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to apply for a visa. The State Department says that more than 40 percent of all applications are rejected. There are numerous agencies in Iran and other countries that mediate and assist Iranians seeking appointments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope this is fake news,\u201d said Ali Reza Falahati, who runs a mediation agency in Ankara. \u201cPeople are constantly calling to ask us if their appointments are canceled. They paid visa fees, $160, and booked tickets and hotels. I just hope this will be all right.\u201d\n\nOne woman in Tehran, a 28-year-old restaurant manager, nearly broke down in tears when hearing news of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe said she had been waiting for a green card and that she and her husband had been planning for years to move to Orlando, Fla., where her mother, father and brother live. They even postponed having a baby, she said, and now regretted having waited for so long.\n\nThe effects of the measure were felt in Africa, too.\n\nMany people in Mogadishu, Somalia, used the same word to describe Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a dabaal,\u201d said Guled Hassan, a Somali university student. \u201cDabaal\u201d is the Somali word for a fool.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Hussan and his friends, who were hanging out in a park near Mogadishu\u2019s crumbling seashore, slurping mango shakes, were paying extra close attention to the news streaming into their phones. Just about all of them had heard that Mr. Trump might ban visas for Somalis.\n\nJust about all of them said they wanted to go to the United States, and they mostly agreed the visa ban was \u201cstupid\u201d and \"unfair.\u201d\n\nNo Somalis doubt that their country has a terrorism problem. Just the day before, more than a dozen people were killed in a double bombing at a Mogadishu hotel. The Shabab, a Somali militant group, took credit for the attack and remains one of the world\u2019s most bloodthirsty and dangerous terrorist organizations, having killed thousands across several countries in eastern Africa.\n\nBut the consensus was that Mr. Trump was punishing all Somalis for the potential misdeeds of a few. \u201cHe won the election by saying he would chase away black people,\u201d said Bilal Guled Mohamed, a college student.\n\nAnother young man, Abdul Karim Hilowle, asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Somalis already in the U.S. and those who want to go now?\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas Erdbrink", "Jeffrey Gettleman"], "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["iran", "trump", "citizens", "visas", "information", "united", "iranian", "shock", "crackdown", "states", "mr", "bewilderment", "visa"], "summary": "While Iran willingly allows its citizens to travel to the United States, it is ideologically opposed to sharing information with Washington.\nThe visa ban will provide an early indication of where relations between Tehran and the Trump administration are headed, one analyst said.\nMany people in Mogadishu, Somalia, used the same word to describe Mr. Trump.\nJust about all of them had heard that Mr. Trump might ban visas for Somalis.\nBut the consensus was that Mr. Trump was punishing all Somalis for the potential misdeeds of a few."}
