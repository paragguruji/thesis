And a second action, which would designate the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political movement in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization, is now under discussion at the White House, administration officials say.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeyond the restrictions the order imposed on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, it declared that the United States should keep out those with \u201chostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles\u201d and \u201cthose who would place violent ideologies over American law,\u201d clearly a reference to Shariah.\n\nRejected by most serious scholars of religion and shunned by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, this dark view of Islam has nonetheless flourished on the fringes of the American right since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it has now moved to the center of American decision-making on security and law, alarming many Muslims.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted that the executive order is not a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d and his supporters say it is a sensible precaution to safeguard Americans. Asked about the seeming antipathy to Islam that appeared to inform the order, the White House pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in the August speech and on another occasion that signaled support for reform-minded Muslims. His administration, Mr. Trump said in August, \u201cwill be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voice.\u201d\n\nJames Jay Carafano, a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who advised the Trump transition at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, said the executive order was simply \u201ctrying to get ahead of the threat.\u201d As pressure increases on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, he said, \u201ctens of thousands of foreign fighters\u201d will flee. Some could try to reach America, perhaps posing as refugees, he said, so stronger vetting of those entering the country is crucial.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Flynn last February tweeted a link to an anti-Muslim video and wrote, \u201cFear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\u201d In an interview, he said that \u201cIslam is not necessarily a religion but a political system that has a religious doctrine behind it.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Bannon has spoken passionately about the economic and security dangers of immigration and took the lead role in shaping the immigration order. In a 2014 talk to a meeting at the Vatican, he said the \u201cJudeo-Christian West\u201d is at war with Islam.\n\n\u201cThere is a major war brewing, a war that\u2019s already global,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn\u2019t act.\u201d Elsewhere, on his radio show for Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cIslam is not a religion of peace \u2014 Islam is a religion of submission,\u201d and he warned of Muslim influence in Europe: \u201cTo be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise.\u201d\n\nOthers with similar views of Islam include Sebastian Gorka, who taught at the National Defense University and is a deputy national security adviser. Mr. Gorka\u2019s wife, Katharine, who headed think tanks that focused on the dangers of Islam, now works at the Department of Homeland Security. Tera Dahl, who was an aide to former Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is a National Security Council official. Walid Phares, a Lebanese American Christian who has advised politicians on counterterrorism, advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign but does not currently have a government post. All four have written for Breitbart News, the right-wing website previously run by Mr. Bannon.\n\nThey all reflect the hard-line opinions of what some have described as the Islamophobia industry, a network of researchers who have warned for many years of the dangers of Islam and were thrilled by Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey warn about the danger to American freedoms supposedly posed by Islamic law, and have persuaded several state legislatures to prohibit Shariah\u2019s use. It is a claim that draws eye rolls from most Muslims and scholars of Islam, since Muslims make up about 1 percent of the United States population and are hardly in a position to dictate to the other 99 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe majority of Muslims don\u2019t interpret the Quran literally,\u201d said Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution. \u201cYou can have five Muslims who all say we think this is God\u2019s exact words, but they all disagree with each other on what that means in practice.\u201d\n\nAmong the most outspoken of those warning about Islam are Pamela Geller, of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencer, of Jihad Watch, and Frank Gaffney Jr., of the Center for Security Policy.\n\nAll three were hosted by Mr. Bannon on his Breitbart radio program before he became chief executive of the Trump campaign in August. Mr. Gaffney appeared at least 34 times. His work has often been cited in speeches by Mr. Flynn. Kellyanne Conway, now counselor to Mr. Trump, did polling for Mr. Gaffney\u2019s center. Last year, the center gave Senator Jeff Sessions, who has warned of the \u201ctotalitarian threat\u201d posed by radical Islam and is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, its annual \u201cKeeper of the Flame\u201d award.", "authors": ["Scott Shane", "Matthew Rosenberg", "Eric Lipton"], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "trump", "pushes", "policymaking", "dark", "security", "trumps", "view", "islam", "order", "muslim", "muslims", "mr", "center"], "summary": "The executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump signed on Friday might be viewed as the first major victory for this geopolitical school.\nWith Mr. Trump\u2019s election, it has now moved to the center of American decision-making on security and law, alarming many Muslims.\nMr. Trump has insisted that the executive order is not a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d and his supporters say it is a sensible precaution to safeguard Americans.\nThe executive order, she said, will backfire by reinforcing the jihadist line that the United States is at war with Islam.\nKellyanne Conway, now counselor to Mr. Trump, did polling for Mr. Gaffney\u2019s center."}
