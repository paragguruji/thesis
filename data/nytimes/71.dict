It is an aggressive use of presidential power that follows through on the nationalistic vision Mr. Trump presented during his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cA nation without borders is not a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday at the Department of Homeland Security, where he signed the orders alongside the newly sworn-in secretary, John F. Kelly. \u201cBeginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.\u201d\n\nThe plans are a sharp break with former President Barack Obama\u2019s approach and what was once a bipartisan consensus to devise a path to citizenship for some of the nation\u2019s illegal immigrants. Mr. Obama, however, angered many immigrant groups by deporting millions of unauthorized workers, largely during his first term.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies were filled with chants from his supporters of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d has vowed to go much further. He has often described unauthorized immigrants as criminals who must be found and forcibly removed from the United States, as he did again on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are going to get the bad ones out \u2014 the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. We are going to get them out, and we are going to get them out fast.\u201d\n\nThe president had invited the families of people killed by unauthorized immigrants to watch him sign the orders alongside Homeland Security employees, and he asked each of them to stand in turn, telling of the deaths of their relatives, which he said had inspired his policies.\n\n\u201cWe hear you, we see you, and you will never, ever be ignored again,\u201d Mr. Trump said, contending that they had been \u201cvictimized by open borders.\u201d\n\nThe immigration orders drew furious condemnation from civil rights and religious groups as well as immigrant advocacy organizations. The groups described them as meanspirited, counterproductive and costly and said the new policies would raise constitutional concerns while undermining the American tradition of welcoming people from around the world.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re setting out to unleash this deportation force on steroids, and local police will be able to run wild, so we\u2019re tremendously concerned about the impact that could have on immigrants and families across the country,\u201d said Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cAfter today\u2019s announcement, the fear quotient is going to go up exponentially.\u201d\n\nLynn Tramonte, the deputy director of America\u2019s Voice Education Fund, an immigration advocacy group, said Mr. Trump was \u201cwasting no time taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty.\u201d She called the orders \u201ca dramatic, radical and extreme assault on immigrants and the values of our country.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, who had planned to travel to Washington next week to meet with Mr. Trump, let it be known that he was considering canceling his trip, senior Mexican officials said.\n\nMr. Trump has claimed that Mexico will ultimately pay for the wall, but officials there have repeatedly said they have no intention of doing so.\n\nConservative organizations in the United States and some Republican lawmakers praised Mr. Trump\u2019s moves, saying they would usher in overdue enforcement of crucial homeland security laws that Mr. Obama had refused to carry out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis looks like a return to enforcing the immigration laws, which is something that President Obama strayed from and has not been prioritized in a very long time,\u201d said Tommy Binion, the director of policy outreach at the conservative-aligned Heritage Foundation. \u201cTo have President Trump focus on the problems immigration is bringing us as a nation is a relief. Finally, we have a government that recognizes the tragedies that we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump will not be able to accomplish the goals laid out in the immigration orders by himself. Congress would have to appropriate new funding for the construction of a wall, which some have estimated could cost tens of billions of dollars. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump directed federal agencies to use existing funds as a start to the wall and formally called for the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 immigration officers.\n\ncalif. arizona United States Tijuana NEW MEXICO El Paso Texas Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Laredo Areas where there is fencing Mexico United States Mexico Areas where there is fencing\n\nThe order would threaten the nation\u2019s roughly three dozen sanctuary cities \u2014 jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities seeking to detain unauthorized immigrants \u2014 with losing federal grant money if they do not comply with such requests.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump is reviving a program called Secure Communities, ended by the Obama administration, in which federal officials use digital fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who commit crimes.\n\nThe provisions are chilling to many immigration advocates, who argued that they could sweep up unauthorized immigrants beyond the criminals Mr. Trump says he wants to target. Among those listed as priorities for removal are those who have \u201cengaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,\u201d which would essentially include any undocumented worker who has signed an employment agreement in the United States.\n\nThe order also includes a section that directs federal agencies to adjust their privacy policies to exclude unauthorized immigrants, in effect allowing the sharing of their personal identifying information, which could be used to track and apprehend them.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s sweeping and constitutionally suspect executive actions, the president is turning his back on both our history and our values as a proud nation of immigrants,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. \u201cWasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall Mexico will never pay for, and punishing cities that do not want their local police forces forced to serve as President Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet, does nothing to fix our immigration system or keep Americans safe.\u201d\n\nThe order on refugees is in line with a Muslim ban that Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign, though it does not single out any particular religion. It orders the secretary of state and the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize those who are persecuted members of religious minorities, essentially ensuring that Christians living in predominantly Muslim countries would be at the top of the list.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect Americans,\u201d the order states, \u201cwe must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt says that for the time being, admitting anyone from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "authors": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "type": "article"}
