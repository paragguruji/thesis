{"title": "Irish Premier Uses St. Patrick\u2019s Day Ritual to Lecture Trump on Immigration", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/us/politics/irish-st-patricks-enda-kenny-trump.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cWe would like this to be sorted,\u201d Mr. Kenny said, calling for these people to be given a path to citizenship. \u201cIt would remove a burden of so many that they could now stand in the light and say, \u2018Now I\u2019m free to contribute to America as I know I can.\u2019 That\u2019s what people want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll they want is the opportunity to be free,\u201d he added, choking up momentarily.\n\nIt was a somber moment during a ritual that is normally as convivial and rancor-free as any in Washington. The last seven such visits by Mr. Kenny featured good-natured gibes about former Vice President\u2019s Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s long-winded speeches or President Barack Obama\u2019s habit of toasting the taoiseach with water-filled glasses.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration has posed a dilemma for Mr. Kenny, who is expected to step down within weeks after six years in office. Mr. Trump is unpopular in Ireland, which has drifted to the left of most Irish-Americans, and there were calls at home for Mr. Kenny to skip the annual visit to Washington. During the presidential campaign, he referred to Mr. Trump\u2019s language as \u201cracist and dangerous.\u201d\n\nNigel Farage, the British populist leader who is a staunch ally of Mr. Trump, demanded in an interview on Wednesday with RTE, the Irish national broadcaster, that Mr. Kenny apologize to the president for his remarks.\n\nIn Washington, Mr. Kenny tried to modulate his criticism, saying it was not directed at Mr. Trump, but at his words. At the lunch Thursday, he straddled a line between being a polite guest and the bearer of a message.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A contingent of Irish-American advisers, he noted, had a strong hand in devising or enforcing the travel ban. The Irish leader, Mr. O\u2019Toole wrote, needed to stand up for all immigrants in the United States, not just Irish ones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther advocates for Irish immigrants noted that while Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban did not affect Ireland, it could eventually be expanded to target different groups.\n\n\u201cWhen you fire a stone to hit someone from Mexico, you\u2019re hitting someone from Mayo,\u201d said Ciaran Staunton, the co-founder of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, referring to a county in western Ireland.\n\nStill, Mr. Staunton said he opposed efforts to vilify Mr. Trump. A better strategy, he said, would be to lobby him to allow the 20 percent of the 11 million undocumented people in the United States who could easily obtain legal residency to do so without leaving the country.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump tried to keep things light. But in welcoming Mr. Kenny, he cited what he said was an Irish proverb that speaks to the fickleness of human relations. (The provenance of the phrase quickly came into dispute, with some on social media pointing out its similarity to a stanza in a poem by a Nigerian poet, Albashir Adam Alhassan.)\n\n\u201cAlways remember to forget the friends that proved untrue,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cBut never forget to remember those who have stuck by you.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Mark Landler", "type": "article"}
