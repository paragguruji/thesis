People are more confident because of him being president. The stock market\u2019s going up as well.\n\nI don\u2019t think that he\u2019s out for popular opinion. I think that he\u2019s going to do what he thinks is best. He doesn\u2019t care what you think. I\u2019m kind of that way, too, so I can respect that.\n\nThe \u2018Sell Talk\u2019\n\nVoter: Deb Alighire, 44. Engineer and program manager at Mopar, a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nHome: Clarkston, Mich.\n\nRight away he was meeting with the Big Three; I remember feeling like my heart warmed. Somebody cares about us. Then I see him getting on the helicopter with his grandkids and that\u2019s very endearing.\n\nI\u2019m happy with the H-1B visa reform. A friend got laid off, he was watching all his co-workers get laid off sequentially; they\u2019re being replaced by H-1B visa people.\n\nWe got to be able to get birth control if we don\u2019t have money. That was my love of Obama, my birth control was free. We need to care about 50 percent of the population and what they\u2019re going to do. Especially the group of women that don\u2019t have the means to pay for it. Jesus, say you\u2019re working at Walmart and then you have a baby, what are you going to do? You\u2019ve got to have the care.\n\nOn his tweeting, it\u2019s almost like the sell talk \u2014 we\u2019re going to win. Trying to rally the troops. I think that\u2019s why he acts the way he does, the phrases he repeats, that\u2019s how he managed his companies. It makes sense, it\u2019s more of a corporate thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRacism on Both Sides\n\nPhoto\n\nVoter: Taylor Davis, 28. Works in a small business.\n\nHome: Enfield, Conn.\n\nFeminism feels very exclusive \u2014 if you don\u2019t vote the same or feel the same on these platform issues like pro-choice, you can\u2019t be part of their club. We have to give women voice and weave them into politics. We can have equality with men, and it doesn\u2019t have to be equal balance. I\u2019m all for women getting ahead in politics or business. I\u2019m not a self-hating woman.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve become a Republican, I\u2019ve heard a lot of outrageously racist things, from both sides, and I\u2019m not happy about that. I am very disappointed that there is so much of a divide. He\u2019s focusing a lot on crimes and gangs, law and order, but that\u2019s not the only facet when it comes to minorities in this country, specifically African-Americans. I\u2019m worried about mass incarceration rates and so on. A huge reason I didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton: incarceration of minorities went up under Bill Clinton.\n\nPeace Through Strength\n\nVoter: Robin Mueller, 42 as of December. Preschool teacher.\n\nHome: Sterling Heights, Mich.\n\nI like how he\u2019s handling Syria, North Korea and China. I agree with the peace-through-strength idea. The gassing of innocent women and children is very disturbing to me.\n\nEspecially after seeing what is going on in Syria, to turn them away, especially the women and the children, we\u2019ve got to figure out something. This area has a lot of Syrian refugees. I met a little girl. She was just a sweet beautiful child, you could tell by her face, she did not have it good where she came from. She just kept hugging me and grabbing on to me.\n\nI\u2019m not delusional to think that terrorist groups won\u2019t send in people with these large groups of refugees here. You have to figure out a good way to fix this and keep America safe as well. Why wasn\u2019t Saudi Arabia on that list? I know why they weren\u2019t. We all know why. There are countries that we don\u2019t want to upset or make angry because we think we need them. I was not a fan of the executive order, the way it was done.\n\nTake Away the Twitter\n\nVoter: Katie Holder, 39. Owns a weight-loss business.\n\nHome: Gulf Shores, Ala.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been pretty pleased. Kind of disappointed that we haven\u2019t really come together as a country yet.\n\nIf they\u2019re sitting here spying on us in our homes, then why wouldn\u2019t they spy on a major candidate? They were spying on Hillary, why wouldn\u2019t they spy on him? I\u2019m saying it wouldn\u2019t shock me. Not one bit.\n\nI think, unfortunately, somebody needs to take away the Twitter. I like that he\u2019s able to talk to us, but for the love of God, somebody take away the phone. He would be a lot more effective that way. I don\u2019t have a filter, but I\u2019m not the president of the freaking United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI would like to see, as far as talking about Ivanka\u2019s business, cut that out. Talking about \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d that kind of stuff, you\u2019re done with that, at least for the next four years. Stop. You got much bigger fish to fry. It doesn\u2019t help your case any at all. Of course, he\u2019s new to being president and he\u2019s new to politics. That just comes with learning a job, any job.\n\nReach Out to Democrats\n\nPhoto\n\nVoter: Rebecca Gregory, 47. Nurse.\n\nHome: Roseville, Mich.\n\nHe\u2019s allowing the states to do what they want on Planned Parenthood, not defunding it on a federal level. I would like Planned Parenthood to be funded, and I\u2019m sure in some states it won\u2019t be because of that. Being a Republican candidate, I don\u2019t see he has much choice on that.\n\nIt\u2019s at least nice to see law enforcement given props during speeches and being supported \u2014 that\u2019s a nice change.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed in the fact that he\u2019s getting so much pushback on everything he tries to pass. He\u2019s good at wheeling and dealing and offering things, if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019d like to see him reach out to Democrats, and I\u2019d like to see them listening. There\u2019s got to be compromise on both sides. We don\u2019t have to like each other, but we have to work together. I\u2019d want to see something happen and quick with the A.C.A. \u2014 it\u2019s not going well. When that falters, people will be without insurance and without health care. I\u2019m concerned about that.\n\nWhat Is Congress Doing?\n\nPhoto\n\nVoter: Guzin Karides, 50. Former lawyer, homemaker.\n\nHome: Virginia Beach\n\nWhat is Congress doing? They have failed on the health care bill. And they couldn\u2019t get one voted on when they had a majority. It\u2019s a little disgusting.\n\nWhy people like me love Trump so much \u2014 he doesn\u2019t stand for it. We put someone in who\u2019s not necessarily so Republican, it was more that he was for common-sense government.\n\nI agree with what he did with the travel ban. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Muslim ban. He\u2019s fulfilling his promise to protect the border and build a wall. Hopefully he\u2019s learned who to count on, who not to count on in the last 100 days.\n\nI love his tweets. He\u2019s holding the media\u2019s feet to the fire. He has a way to get his point of view out. I think Trump sometimes exaggerates things, but I don\u2019t think he outright lies. Most rational people know what he means.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe wanted to prove he was different than Obama with one big mother bomb. But don\u2019t get us dragged into these wars. I hope he stays an American president, not trying to become a world president, just because McCain and neocons would praise him. I hope he\u2019s strong enough and stays thick-skinned enough. I imagine it\u2019s very difficult for him to stick true to what he promises. He doesn\u2019t always hear from us, the people.\n\nI really do want him to spend more time in the White House and not to go to Florida so much. The people that put him in office need him to be there, and not travel so much to where he\u2019s probably more comfortable. You\u2019ve got to suck it up. If that\u2019s my worst criticism, that\u2019s not so bad.\n\nI\u2019d give him an A-, B+, Congress a failing grade.", "publish_date": "2017-04-29", "authors": "Susan Chira", "type": "article"}
