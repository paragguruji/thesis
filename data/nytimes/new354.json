On top of that, influence peddlers pay him through his campaign. In the first three months of the Trump presidency, his 2020 campaign spent almost $500,000 on hotels, golf clubs and restaurants owned by the Trump family.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

After promising not to talk business with his father, Eric Trump admitted that he will discuss \u201cthe bottom line, profitability reports and stuff like that\u201d with Dad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also said, \u201cNepotism is kind of a factor of life.\u201d Well, yes \u2014 in kleptocracies, dictatorships and monarchies. For years, the United States has worked to eliminate nepotism in backwater regimes. Now it\u2019s the role model for inbred charlatans.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that taxpayers funnel money to the Trumps when the president brings his entourage to his for-profit club in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. But what about that Mar-a-Lago marketing piece that you and I paid for on an official government website?\n\nThe same administration that wants to zero-out public money for the arts used public money to inform people of Trump\u2019s exquisite taste in private property. The post has since been taken down.\n\nThis week Trump proposed a huge tax cut for himself and the businesses he and his family own. He would have saved $31 million, in the one year for which we have his tax return, under his plan. At the same time, he wants to take away college scholarships for the poor and gut funding for cancer research.\n\nHis associates take their cue from the top. Michael Flynn, the man who led the lock-her-up chants against Hillary Clinton, possibly broke the law by failing to disclose the big sums he got from foreign governments. And Kellyanne Conway violated the rule against public officials\u2019 promoting private businesses when she plugged Ivanka\u2019s product line.\n\nA lot of this will be resolved in lawsuits, and perhaps impeachment. Meanwhile, Trump continues to debase the office. He spent four hours at the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent, the no-talent musician who called President Barack Obama a \u201csubhuman mongrel.\u201d The guests posed, in thug mode, before a portrait of Hillary Clinton \u2014 a fitting image for a host who has turned the home of Lincoln and Roosevelt into a House of Grifters.", "authors": ["Timothy Egan"], "publish_date": "2017-04-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["foreign", "trump", "businesses", "public", "york", "sign", "white", "house", "grifters", "tax", "business", "money"], "summary": "Because the Trump White House is a business with the shades closed \u2014 the visitor logs no longer available to the public, the tax returns a dark secret \u2014 we cannot know how extensively the Trump clan is making foreign policy to help its holdings.\nThe same administration that wants to zero-out public money for the arts used public money to inform people of Trump\u2019s exquisite taste in private property.\nThis week Trump proposed a huge tax cut for himself and the businesses he and his family own.\nAnd Kellyanne Conway violated the rule against public officials\u2019 promoting private businesses when she plugged Ivanka\u2019s product line.\nHe spent four hours at the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent, the no-talent musician who called President Barack Obama a \u201csubhuman mongrel.\u201d The guests posed, in thug mode, before a portrait of Hillary Clinton \u2014 a fitting image for a host who has turned the home of Lincoln and Roosevelt into a House of Grifters."}
