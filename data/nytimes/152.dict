Former President Barack Obama, scarcely out of office, has dissented.\n\nAs my colleague Scott Shane noted, citing studies by Charles Kurzman, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, no one since 9/11 \u201chas been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\u201d\n\nA draft dissent memo circulating at the State Department noted that, \u201cA vanishingly small number of terror attacks on U.S. soil have been committed by foreign nationals who recently entered the United States on an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It will cause hardship and misery for tens or hundreds of thousands of people because that is precisely what it is intended to do.\u201d\n\nAnd here we get to the president\u2019s character, doubly important when, as in the Trump White House, personality dominates process.\n\nFor well over a decade Trump hosted a successful TV show that hinged on a spectacle of controlled cruelty \u2014 his summary dismissal of a contestant with the words \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d All the action built toward the tantalizing moment when Trump brought down the guillotine.\n\nNo doubt the experience offered him insights into the human fascination with power, as well as the human capacity for pleasure in others\u2019 suffering. Certainly, in just 10 tumultuous days as president of the United States, Trump has demonstrated a streak of gratuitous cruelty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is no other explanation for such a pointless measure that inflicts so much pain.\n\nHere in Britain a petition started this weekend against a planned State visit later this year by Trump has already gained some 1.5 million signatures. The government of Prime Minister Theresa May, desperate for Trump\u2019s favor to offset its Brexit travails, has had to scramble to reassure British dual nationals who may have an Iraqi passport, for example, that they can enter the United States.\n\nSir Mo Farah, the British Olympic gold medalist who was born in Somalia, and whose family lives in the United States, wrote: \u201cOn 1st January this year, her majesty the Queen made me a knight of the realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.\u201d\n\nThe measure has given many this feeling they no longer belong. Sanam Naraghi-Anderlini has British and Iranian passports, holds a green card, has an American husband and two American children, and works in Washington as executive director of the International Civil Society Action Network. She told me she\u2019s unsure if she should travel to Germany in a few days on business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just insane,\u201d she told me. \u201cMay talks about Churchill, but it feels like she\u2019s appeasing Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump does not retreat. He does not admit mistakes. That is not his style. This month, in tweets, he has written, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d and he has accused two prominent and dissenting Republican senators of \u201calways looking to start World War III.\u201d\n\nImpetuosity allied to cruelty combined with immense power equals trouble. The current storm would cause a normal man who\u2019s a neophyte in a big job to reflect on other approaches. But is anything about Trump normal?", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Roger Cohen", "type": "article"}
