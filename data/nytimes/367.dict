Saudi Arabia has committed to shifting its economy from its dependence on oil and wants American investment to speed that process, while Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to sell the kingdom an additional $110 billion in weapons provides more business for American companies. This is excessive; in exchange, the Saudis should be asked to make a more serious commitment to regional peace, including a political settlement in Yemen.\n\nAlong with other Sunni Arab countries, Saudi Arabia is obsessed with Iran, which is unquestionably playing a troubling and mischievous role in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and the Saudis are pleased with Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Iran line. But focusing only on Iran ignores the destabilizing activities of Saudi Arabia in Yemen, where Saudi bombs have killed untold numbers of civilians. It also ignores the fact that Saudi Arabia\u2019s conservative brand of Islam has done much to inspire ISIS and other extremists.\n\nMr. Obama tried to forge a more neutral path, engaging Iran on the nuclear deal and admonishing the Saudis to find a way to live with Iran. There is speculation that the Sunni Arabs and Israel might cooperate in a regional security arrangement. This could be constructive, but not if its only purpose is to ostracize Iran.\n\nWith Mr. Trump embattled at home, there\u2019s a real danger that in his eagerness for a successful visit he will agree to almost anything his hosts desire, like more American involvement in proxy wars against Iran in Yemen and Syria. Also, he has shown little interest in human rights and in pressing authoritarian countries to treat their people \u2014 especially women, in Saudi Arabia\u2019s case \u2014 with respect.\n\nThis trip is Mr. Trump\u2019s first chance to act as a global statesman. He will define that role not by accommodating Arab demands but by pursuing a strategy that advances America\u2019s security interests as well as those of its partners.", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "authors": "The Editorial Board", "type": "article"}
