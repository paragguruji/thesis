All he had to do was stick to his lines: The president\u2019s proposals are the wisest. The president\u2019s ethics are the purest. The president\u2019s crowds are the biggest. The president\u2019s detractors fall into three camps: illegals, commies and Samantha Bee.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t manage that much, or rather that little, and so Sarah Huckabee Sanders is claiming ever more podium time. She won\u2019t last. No one will. The relevant sinkhole isn\u2019t the one that opened up just outside Mar-a-Loco last month. It\u2019s the one beneath the feet of anyone dippy, delusional or daring enough to think that Trumplandia is terrain on which to make a positive difference, let alone a career.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

He has lumbered onto investigators\u2019 radar and thus teetered ever so slightly from favor \u2014 that\u2019s Steve Bannon chortling in the background \u2014 though he reportedly tasted Trump\u2019s rancor before, when he hid in Aspen during the health care debacle, skiing while Washington churned.\n\nWhere will the buck stop next? With the tiniest Trump, Barron? He has some nerve doing homework while tax reform is still being hammered out and infrastructure is just coming together.\n\nTrump\u2019s quickness to deflect blame, readiness to designate scapegoats, unpredictable tirades and stinginess with the loyalty that he demands from others aren\u2019t just character flaws. They\u2019re serious and quite possibly insurmountable obstacles to governing.\n\nThose who serve him are forever fearful of being undercut, perpetually having to defend behavior from him that\u2019s indefensible, and demoralized as a result. Consider Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose torments were summarized by James Hohmann this week in The Washington Post. How can the country get the best from him when he\u2019s getting the worst from Trump?\n\nMany of the country\u2019s diplomats are in a funk, as my Times colleague Mark Landler just recounted, and the ludicrously large number of unfilled positions throughout the administration partly reflects the limited appeal of such a gloomy club. There was never any overflow of top-tier applicants, given how many Republicans swore off Trump and how many others were spurned by him for not being obsequious enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut now that the terms of working for him \u2014 ridicule by tweet, potentially stratospheric legal bills \u2014 are clear, the pool of available talent is a puddle too shallow to keep a newt afloat. Mike Allen reported in Axios on Tuesday morning that the creation of Trump\u2019s \u201cwar room\u201d \u2014 a battalion of lawyers and such who would do damage control during the Russia probe \u2014 is on hold, because he can\u2019t find the soldiers to staff it.\n\nBy many accounts, the atmosphere in the White House is one part high school cafeteria, two parts \u201cLord of the Flies.\u201d Aides who are jockeying for position and trying to safeguard their reputations ask operatives on the outside to whisper to the media that they\u2019re up while their rivals are down, and so we\u2019re subjected to a daily Dow Jones on the stock of various players, with special note of who has Oval Office \u201cwalk-in privileges.\u201d\n\nI suspect that the Trump era will flip that phrase, and the people walking out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will be seen as \u2014 and be \u2014 the privileged ones.", "publish_date": "2017-06-07", "authors": "Frank Bruni", "type": "article"}
