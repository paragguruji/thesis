Mr. Trump has proposed to add $54 billion to the Pentagon\u2019s budget, which amounts to a 10 percent increase. There have been at least 10 larger increases to the base defense budget since the 1977 fiscal year and four since 2002.\n\nFactoring in war spending, Mr. Trump\u2019s claim is even less credible. There have been 27 years since 1940 in which the military spending was as high or higher than the proposed increase. As a percentage of gross domestic product, there have been roughly 35 years in which military spending matched or surpassed what Mr. Trump is calling for.\n\nMr. Trump talked up his executive actions reviving two major oil pipelines.\n\n\u201cI have already authorized the construction of the long, stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access Pipeline. A lot of jobs. I have also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel.\u201d\n\nThis needs context. Mr. Trump cleared the way for the pipelines previously blocked by the Obama administration early in his presidency and has previously specified that the two will create \u201ctens of thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nKeystone, according to a 2014 State Department estimate, would support 42,000 temporary jobs, about 3,900 in construction, and 35 permanent jobs. But Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential directive on using American steel does not apply to Keystone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

These American victims were ignored by the media.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. Mr. Obama began targeting unauthorized immigrants who had been convicted of serious crimes, who were considered national security threats and who had recently arrived, in 2014. By the end of his presidency, about 90 percent of those deported had criminal records.\n\nThe individuals killed by undocumented immigrants mentioned by Mr. Trump in his joint address to Congress, for example, have received widespread coverage. Here are New York Times stories on Jamiel Shaw Jr., Danny Oliver and Michael Davis.\n\nMr. Trump defended his travel ban, asserting that hundreds of immigrants had been implicated in terrorism.\n\n\u201cHundreds of people from outside the country have been related to terrorism-related offenses.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. Independent analyses do not support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. The New America Foundation identified 12 jihadist terrorists who had killed people in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. All were American citizens or permanent residents and none had ties to the countries named in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOut of the nearly 400 nondeadly jihadist terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11, perpetrators were linked to Iran or Somalia in three cases. Both countries were named in the travel ban.\n\nAccording to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, immigrant Muslim extremists have accounted for 16 out of 240,000 murders in the United States since 9/11.\n\nMr. Trump promoted tax cuts in the Obamacare repeal and replace bill.\n\n\u201cIt repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.\u201d\n\nThis needs context. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the bill would repeal $883 billion in Affordable Care Act taxes. Nearly $275 billion would come from tossing out a payroll tax increase and a tax on net investment income that affect just the top 5 percent of earners.\n\nThe other big cut, $145 billion, comes from the repeal of the health insurance sales tax, which affects everyone. According to the Tax Policy Center, two-thirds of the cuts would benefit the top 20 percent of taxpayers, with 40 percent going to the top 1 percent of income earners.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re changing the way the benefits and costs are distributed,\u201d said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that the rich won\u2019t do well.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump suggested that his negotiations had saved the Pentagon hundreds of millions of dollars on an order of F-35 jets.\n\n\u201cOn the airplanes, I saved $725 million dollars. Probably took me about half an hour if you add it up all of the time.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. The Defense Department announced $728 million in reductions in February, two months after Mr. Trump criticized the high cost. Mr. Trump certainly accelerated the negotiations, but the costs began to go down in 2011.\n\nMr. Trump claimed that trade policies block American cars from being sold abroad.\n\n\u201cWe take them \u2014 \u2018Come on in, folks. Come on in. No tax. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 We make cars; they don\u2019t take us.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. Mr. Trump has previously specified this claim to Japan. American cars are very rare in Japan, though this is not a result of Japanese policies or trade barriers but rather the price and reputation of American cars.\n\nIn fact, the United States adds a 2.5 percent tariff on Japanese cars while Japan has no border tax on automobiles from the United States.", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Linda Qiu", "type": "article"}
