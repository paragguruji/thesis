She was first elected to the Parliament, in the House of Representatives, 20 years ago but left in 1998. She founded the One Nation party, and its members, along with seven other independent senators, hold enough sway in the 76-seat Senate to barter with the prime minister.\n\nThe problem for Mr. Turnbull will be corralling that bloc or working with the opposition Labor Party to pass laws.\n\n\u201cTurnbull\u2019s position is extremely problematic,\u201d said Peter Chen, a political science professor at the University of Sydney. \u201cHis strategy, the best one he can come up with, is governing with the support of the Labor Party.\u201d\n\nBefore the elections, Mr. Turnbull had said that Ms. Hanson was not a welcome presence in politics. But that was before he narrowly scraped back into power.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: Asia Edition Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.

His aim was to increase the government\u2019s majority and its chances of having legislation passed through the Senate, where he said he believed it would be harder for dissenting lawmakers to retain their seats. He was wrong.\n\nThe coalition lost three Senate seats and now holds 30, and One Nation, which previously had no Senate seats, won four. The opposition Labor Party holds 26, and the Greens party, the next biggest voting bloc, has nine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmaller parties, including the independent Nick Xenophon Team, Family First, the Liberal Democrats and the Jacqui Lambie Network, also secured seats in the Senate, which is home to the largest number of independents not aligned with a major political party in more than a decade.\n\nIn the 150-seat House of Representatives, the coalition has a majority of just one seat.\n\nOn Wednesday, senators from the Greens party filed out of the chamber as Ms. Hanson spoke.\n\n\u201cIn my first speech, in 1996, I said we were in danger of being swamped by Asians,\u201d Ms. Hanson said. \u201cNow we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims, who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own.\u201d\n\nShe said Muslims are \u201cprominent in organized crime, with associated violence and drug dealing.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI call for stopping further Muslim immigration and banning the burqa as they have done in many countries around the world.\u201d\n\nThe government should prohibit the sale of infrastructure assets to overseas interests, especially Chinese buyers, cut welfare payments and change family law, she said in her wide-ranging speech, which reflected sentiments that often appeal to voters who have tired of Australia\u2019s two mainstream political parties.\n\nWhen Ms. Hanson delivered her speech, Penny Wong, a senior Labor Party senator, was absent from the chamber.\n\n\u201cI chose not to attend,\u201d Ms. Wong told ABC radio on Thursday. \u201cWe, as Australians, should reject the views she puts forward. I think she peddles prejudice and fear. There is no community that has been made stronger by prejudice and fear.\u201d\n\nProfessor Chen said that two decades after Ms. Hanson first entered federal politics, voters were no longer as shocked by what she said.\n\n\u201cBut does that mean she is a more serious problem?\u201d he said. \u201cShe has four senators in the Australian Parliament. People voted for her. You have to take that seriously.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-09-16", "authors": "Michelle Innis", "type": "article"}
