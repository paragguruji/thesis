But the lawsuit, filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group on government corruption, contends that the clause does bar such transactions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Conway, a staunch loyalist who ran the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, has been a frequent presence on television news programs promoting the president\u2019s agenda and dismissing criticism of his style and record.\n\nHer zeal on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf has sometimes landed her at the center of controversy, such as when she claimed that the White House was entitled to put forward \u201calternative facts\u201d about the crowd size at his inauguration, and in a separate interview a few weeks later, referred to a terrorist attack in Bowling Green that never occurred. Last week, she appeared to suggest that President Barack Obama might have spied on Mr. Trump through a microwave. Ms. Conway later clarified that she was speaking in general about possible means of surveillance, not about Mr. Obama, and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said she had been joking.\n\nMr. Conway had been a contender for the job of solicitor general for the Trump administration, but Mr. Trump announced this month that the job would go to Noel J. Francisco.\n\nMr. Conway is a partner at the New York City firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He specializes in securities, contract and antitrust litigation, as well as mergers and acquisitions, according to his biography on the firm\u2019s website. He is a graduate of Harvard University and the Yale Law School.\n\nWhile there is a law against nepotism in government, it would not affect the Conways. It says that no public official can hire a family member \u2014 including one related by marriage \u2014 to serve in an agency or office over which he or she has authority. Ms. Conway would have no direct authority over her husband were he to be confirmed, nor would the reverse be true.", "authors": ["Julie Hirschfeld Davis"], "publish_date": "2017-03-18", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["trump", "clause", "kellyanne", "post", "conway", "husband", "week", "trumps", "later", "ms", "key", "choice", "justice", "white", "york", "mr", "conways"], "summary": "Before he was inaugurated, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers argued that the clause did not bar \u201cfair-market-value transactions,\u201d like paying for hotel rooms.\nInstalling Mr. Conway to lead the civil division means that defending the president from such challenges will become a family affair for the Conways.\nLast week, she appeared to suggest that President Barack Obama might have spied on Mr. Trump through a microwave.\nMr. Conway had been a contender for the job of solicitor general for the Trump administration, but Mr. Trump announced this month that the job would go to Noel J.
