It said the ruling by Judge Robart was too broad, \u201cuntethered\u201d to the claims of the State of Washington, and in conflict with a ruling by another federal district judge, in Boston, who had upheld the order.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit court moved quickly to reject the administration\u2019s appeal, a measure of the urgency and intense interest in the case.\n\nThe Justice Department argued that the president acted well within his constitutional authority. Blocking the order, it concluded, \u201cimmediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment.\u201d\n\nJudge Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declared in his ruling on Friday that \u201cthere\u2019s no support\u201d for the administration\u2019s argument that \u201cwe have to protect the U.S. from individuals\u201d from the affected countries.\n\nVideo\n\nHis ruling also barred the administration from enforcing its limits on accepting refugees. The State Department said Saturday that refugees, including Syrians, could begin arriving as early as Monday. Syrians had faced an indefinite ban under the executive order.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s vehement criticism of the ruling and the certainty that it would be appealed, the government agencies at the center of the issue, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, moved quickly to comply.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawrence Bartlett, the State Department\u2019s director of refugee resettlement, wrote in a departmental email that officials were working to rebook travel for refugees who had previously been scheduled to leave for the United States over a three-week period that will end Feb. 17. A State Department official said the extended time frame accounted for the fact that some refugees will have to make difficult journeys back to airports from refugee camps.\n\nA United Nations spokesman, Leonard Doyle, said about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel.\n\nAirlines, citing American customs officials, were telling passengers from the seven countries that their visas were once again valid. Those carriers, however, have yet to report an uptick in travel, and there appeared to be no rush to airports by visa holders in Europe and the Middle East intent on making their way to the United States.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nEtihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national carrier, said in a statement: \u201cFollowing advice received today from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection unit at Abu Dhabi Airport, the airline will again be accepting nationals from the seven countries named last week.\u201d Other Arab carriers, including Qatar Airways, issued similar statements.\n\nA group of advocacy organizations that had worked to overturn the executive order and help immigrants and refugees stranded at airports issued a statement on Saturday afternoon encouraging travelers \u201cto rebook travel to the United States immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been in contact with hundreds of people impacted by the ban, and we are urging them to get on planes as quickly as possible,\u201d Clare Kane, a law student intern at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, one of the groups involved, said in a statement.\n\nBut some officials were being more cautious, advising travelers to wait for further clarity. The American Embassy in Baghdad said it was waiting for additional guidance from Washington. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the effect will be, but we\u2019re working to get more information,\u201d the embassy told The Associated Press in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

It said it would resume standard inspection procedures. But in a statement, the department defended the order as \u201clawful and appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn his first statement on the matter on Friday evening, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, described the Seattle judge\u2019s action as \u201coutrageous.\u201d Minutes later, the White House issued a new statement deleting the word outrageous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post showed no such restraint. It recalled the attacks he made during the presidential campaign on a federal district judge in California who was presiding over a class-action lawsuit involving Trump University.\n\nDemocrats said the president\u2019s criticism of Judge Robart was a dangerous development. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump seemed \u201cintent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\u201d Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, whose state filed the suit that led to the injunction, said the attack was \u201cbeneath the dignity\u201d of the presidency and could \u201clead America to calamity.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst could weigh on the confirmation process for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the president\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nUntil now, Mr. Trump had been comparatively restrained about the multiple federal judges who have ruled against parts of his immigration order, even as he staunchly defended its legality. Some analysts had speculated that he did not want a repeat of the storm during the campaign when he accused Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of having a conflict of interest in the Trump University case because the judge\u2019s family was of Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump, who had painted Mexicans as rapists and criminals, settled that case after the election.\n\nBut on Saturday morning, Mr. Trump let loose, and in the afternoon he unleashed another volley of attacks on the ruling. In one Twitter message, he questioned why a judge could \u201chalt a Homeland Security travel ban,\u201d which would allow \u201canyone, even with bad intentions,\u201d to enter the country. An hour later, he complained about the \u201cterrible decision,\u201d saying it would let \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people\u201d pour into the country.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Trump had asserted, without evidence, that some Middle Eastern countries supported the immigration order. \u201cInteresting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey know that if certain people are allowed in it\u2019s death & destruction!\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Washington State case was filed on Monday, and it was assigned to Judge Robart that day. He asked for briefs on whether the state had standing to sue, with the last one due on Thursday. On Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit.\n\nOn Friday evening, Judge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the government to revert to its previous immigration policies as the case moved forward. He found that the states and their citizens had been injured by Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe executive order adversely affects the states\u2019 residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,\u201d Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases.\n\nStill, Judge Robart\u2019s order left many questions, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.\n\n\u201cDoes the executive order violate the equal protection of the laws, amount to an establishment of religion, violate rights of free exercise, or deprive aliens of due process of law?\u201d Professor Blackman asked. \u201cWho knows? The analysis is bare bones, and leaves the court of appeals, as well as the Supreme Court, with no basis to determine whether the nationwide injunction was proper.\u201d\n\nWhile large crowds had yet to materialize at airports, there were individual stories of people trying to enter the country.\n\nNael Zaino, 32, a Syrian who had tried unsuccessfully for nearly a week to fly to the United States to join his wife and American-born son, was allowed to board a flight from Istanbul and then Frankfurt late Friday. He landed in Boston around 1 p.m. Saturday and emerged from immigration two hours later, said his sister-in-law Katty Alhayek.\n\nMr. Zaino was believed to be among the first revoked visa holders to enter the United States since the executive order went into effect. His advocates had sought a waiver for him from the State Department, citing family reunification. \u201cMine must be a very special case,\u201d Mr. Zaino said by phone from Istanbul.\n\nIranians, many of them students on their way to American universities, also rushed to book flights to transfer destinations in other Persian Gulf countries, Turkey and Europe. Pedram Paragomi, a 33-year-old Iranian medical student bound for the University of Pittsburgh, who had been caught up in the initial chaos over the travel ban, flew to Frankfurt on Saturday, where he was to transfer to a flight to Boston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m anxious,\u201d he said from Frankfurt. \u201cThe rules keep on changing, but I think I will make it this time.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": "Mark Landler", "type": "article"}
