Garc\u00eda Aguilar left the meeting red-faced with tears.\n\nThe next day a dozen activists gathered at Puente to strategize for Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s case. After reviewing the logistics for the usual public maneuvers \u2014 Facebook post, news release, online petition, sidewalk rally, Twitter hashtag, phone campaign \u2014 they debated the pros and cons of using civil disobedience. In the final years of the Obama administration, activists in Arizona had come to rely on \u201cC.D.,\u201d as they called it, to make their dissatisfaction known. Puente members had blocked roads and chained themselves in front of the entrance to Phoenix\u2019s Fourth Avenue Jail. Yet Francisca Porchas, one of Puente\u2019s organizers, worried about setting an unrealistic precedent with its membership. \u201cFor Lupita we go cray-cray and then everyone expects that,\u201d she said. What would they do if Puente members wanted them to risk arrest every time one of them had a check-in?\n\nPhoto\n\nErnesto Lopez argued that they needed to take advantage of this rare opportunity. A week earlier, thousands of people had swarmed airports around the country to protest the executive order barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the ban, but for everything else it\u2019s dead,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cNobody is talking about people getting deported. In a couple of months, it won\u2019t be possible to get that media attention.\u201d\n\nGarcia wasn\u2019t sure a rally for Garc\u00eda Aguilar would work. \u201cWe\u2019re literally in survival mode,\u201d Garcia told me that week. It was too early to tell how ICE would behave under Trump, but they were braced for the worst. Nobody had a long-term plan yet. Even as he and his staff moved to organize the news conference, his mind kept running through the possibilities: Would it help Garc\u00eda Aguilar stay with her family? Would it snowball into an airport-style protest? Would it cause ICE to double down on her deportation? He decided it was worth trying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShortly before noon on Wednesday, Garc\u00eda Aguilar and her lawyer, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, entered ICE\u2019s field office as supporters chanted \u201cNo est\u00e1 sola!\u201d (You are not alone!) behind her. Telemundo, Univision and ABC shot footage. Supporters posted their own videos on Twitter and Facebook. ICE security warily eyed the scene. An hour later, Ybarra Maldonado exited ICE alone. Garc\u00eda Aguilar had been taken into custody. All around the tree-shaded patio adjacent to ICE\u2019s building, Puente members teared up, imagining the same dark future for themselves. Ybarra Maldonado filed a stay of deportation, and Porchas told everyone to come back later for a candlelight vigil.\n\nThat night a handful of protesters tried to block several vans as they sped from the building\u2019s side exit. More protesters came running from an ICE decoy bus that had initially distracted those attending the vigil out front. Manuel Salda\u00f1a, an Army veteran who did two tours in Afghanistan, planted himself on the ground next to one van\u2019s front tire, wrapping his arms and legs around the wheel. The driver looked incredulous; if he moved the van forward now, he would break one of Salda\u00f1a\u2019s legs. Peering through the van windows with cellphone flashlights, protesters found Garc\u00eda Aguilar sitting in handcuffs. The crowd doubled in size. \u201cThose shifty [expletive],\u201d Ybarra Maldonado said as he stared at the van. ICE, he said, had never notified him that her stay of deportation had been denied.\n\nFour hours later, Garc\u00eda Aguilar was gone. After the Phoenix Police arrested seven people and dispersed the crowd, ICE took her to Nogales, Mexico. By then images of Garc\u00eda Aguilar and the protest were already all over television and social media. She and her children became celebrities within the immigrant rights movement. Carlos Garcia, who was with her in Nogales, told me that Mexican officials stalked her hotel, hoping to snag a photo. \u201cEveryone wanted to be the one to help her,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wanted a piece.\u201d Later that month, her children \u2014 Jacqueline, 14, and Angel, 16 \u2014 sat in the audience of Trump\u2019s first address to Congress, guests of two Democratic representatives from Arizona, Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Ruben Gallego.\n\nDuring the Obama years, most immigrant rights organizations focused on big, idealistic legislation: the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform, neither of which ever made it through Congress. But Puente kept its focus on front-line battles against police-ICE collaboration. For Garcia, who was undocumented until a stepfather adopted him at 16, the most important thing is simply to contest all deportations, without exception. He estimates that Puente has had a hand in stopping about 300 deportations in Arizona since 2012.\n\nEver since Arizona passed Senate Bill 1070, one of the toughest anti-undocumented bills ever signed into law, the state has been known for pioneering the kind of draconian tactics that the Trump administration is now turning into federal policy. But if Arizona has been a testing ground for the nativist agenda, it has also been an incubator for resistance to it. Among the state\u2019s many immigrant rights groups, Puente stands out as the most seasoned and most confrontational. In the weeks and months following Election Day 2016 \u2014 as progressive groups suddenly found themselves on defense, struggling to figure out how to handle America\u2019s new political landscape \u2014 Garcia was inundated with calls for advice. He flew around the country for training sessions with field organizers, strategy meetings with lawyers and policy experts and an off-the-record round table with Senators Dick Durbin and Bernie Sanders in Washington. A soft-spoken man with a stoic demeanor and a long, black ponytail, Garcia was also stunned by Trump\u2019s victory. But organizers in Phoenix had one clear advantage. \u201cAll the scary things that folks are talking about,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen before.\u201d On Nov. 9, he likes to say, the country woke up in Arizona.\n\nDuring the 1990s, after President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration cracked down on illegal entries at the border near San Diego, migrants crossed the desert into Arizona instead, and the state\u2019s undocumented population swelled. In response, the State Legislature passed laws intended to make the daily lives of the undocumented untenable, a legal strategy known as \u201cattrition through enforcement.\u201d Arizona cut off access to driver\u2019s licenses, to social services, to in-state college tuition; it reclassified the use of a fake Social Security number to gain employment as a felony. In 2007 Maricopa County \u2014 an area that includes nearly four million people and the cities of Phoenix, Scottsdale and Mesa \u2014 went further, signing what\u2019s known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE. At the time, fewer than 70 police organizations in the country had 287(g)s, more than half of them in the Southeast. These agreements give local law-enforcement agencies the power to place immigration detainers inside jails and to assemble task forces to arrest people suspected of being undocumented while out on patrol.\n\nThat year Arizona\u2019s undocumented population reached roughly half a million people. In Maricopa County, Sheriff Joseph Arpaio aimed to make that number plummet. He directed police to conduct \u201ccrime suppression\u201d sweeps in predominantly Latino neighborhoods and to raid businesses. During sweeps, police would often detain Latinos for minor offenses like honking a car horn, then demand proof of legal residence.\n\nMaricopa County voters appeared delighted with his tactics; for a time, \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d was the most popular elected official in the state. Support for him may have been abetted by Arizona\u2019s dismal economy. Phoenix had been one of the centers of the building boom; in 2006, business owners in the state said they needed a Mexican guest-worker program to meet the demand for cheap manual labor. But in the spring of 2007, Arizona\u2019s housing market began to crater. In 2008, the state had 117,000 foreclosures, the third-\u200bhighest number in the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor readers of Mexican-American history, this sudden hardening of attitudes toward the undocumented was unsurprising: America has long maintained a love-hate relationship with Spanish-speaking labor. During the Great Depression, at least one million Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans were forcibly repatriated. The following decade, the United States began importing 4.6 million Mexicans to satisfy labor shortages in agricultural fields. But even as that program continued in the 1950s, President Eisenhower\u2019s administration sent another one million back to Mexico by truck, train and ship in a roundup known as \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201d\n\nNear Miami, Ariz., a young Alfredo Gutierrez and his family escaped capture by camping in the mountains. \u201cOne of the reasons they got away with repatriation and they got away with Wetback was because there was no resistance,\u201d Gutierrez, who later became an Arizona state senator, told me. \u201cEveryone of that era will tell you how they hid.\u201d But when Arpaio came for the undocumented, many of them argued for their right to stay. This transformation was due, in great part, to Puente.\n\nDuring its early years, Puente planned protest marches, organized boycotts against local businesses that supported Arpaio and ran know-your-rights classes in Spanish. When Arizona Republicans passed S.B.1070 in 2010, Puente and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network began a national boycott that was estimated to cost Arizona over $200 million in canceled business conferences; 100,000 people marched against the bill in Phoenix. T-shirts with the slogan \u201cLegalize Arizona\u201d popped up in places like Chicago and New York.\n\nYet these actions did little to stop actual deportations. So in the wake of S.B.1070, Puente adopted a new organizing strategy, setting up neighborhood defense committees, or comit\u00e9s del barrio, throughout Maricopa County. \u201cWe had to build a base,\u201d Garcia explains; five or six leaders planning actions in a room was no longer enough. Through the comit\u00e9s, Puente cultivated relationships with hundreds of undocumented people and their families with the goal of piecing together a detailed understanding of how ICE and Arpaio worked. By 2011, it could draw a map tracing the system from arrest to deportation \u2014 and mark each point along the way where a person had the possibility of release.\n\nIn comit\u00e9s, people learned several ways of avoiding deportation. If a police officer pulled them over while driving, they could exercise their constitutional right to remain silent when they were asked whether they were American citizens. If an officer didn\u2019t explicitly detain them, they could walk away from their cars to avoid further questions. If officers appeared at their homes, they could demand to see a warrant before opening the door. The comit\u00e9s also taught people how to argue their own cases if they were handed over to ICE. (Undocumented immigrants have no right to a public defender but often may plead their cases before an immigration judge.) Puente encouraged its members to hash out legal strategies with a lawyer before they ever were detained \u2014 and to sign a copy of a Department of Homeland Security form authorizing media interviews in detention. Because their weekly meetings built genuine social ties, the comit\u00e9s also helped mobilize rapid responses to deportation. Members were more likely to show up for one another at protest rallies.\n\nBut even as the comit\u00e9s were being assembled, there was lingering tension within the broader immigrant-activist community over whether \u201cDreamers,\u201d who had been brought to the United States as minors, should represent themselves separately from the rest of the undocumented population. Undocumented students at Arizona State University had organized themselves into their own tightly knit group, the Arizona Dream Act Coalition (ADAC). Nurtured by other organizers and inspired by the national organization United We Dream, ADAC members came out of the shadows to push Congress to pass the Dream Act and to fight for other legislative exceptions, like in-state tuition. \u201cEarly on, a lot of Dreamers wouldn\u2019t even talk about deportations,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cIt was all about the Dream Act, figuring out tuition and those sorts of things, driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d He was irritated by the Dreamers\u2019 tendency to portray themselves as innocent victims, a tactic that opened the door for conservatives to speak of Dreamers with empathy even as they cracked down on their parents as \u201ccriminals.\u201d (Trump has expressed support for Dreamers.) \u201cA lot us feel like we sort of shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d Erika Andiola, ADAC\u2019s first president, told me after Trump\u2019s election. \u201cBecause we started that narrative like \u2018I was brought here by my parents, not my fault, poor me, I was here as a child\u2019 that kind of created blame on our parents.\u201d\n\nBut after S.B.1070\u2019s \u201cpapers please\u201d law overcame court battles and went into effect in September 2012 \u2014 three months after the Obama administration created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 collaborations between Puente and ADAC increased. In Arizona, the police were now obligated to question anyone that they had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe was undocumented. As a result, a new wave of undocumented residents, including many Dreamers\u2019 parents, found themselves snared in deportation proceedings.\n\nAndiola\u2019s own mother, Maria Guadalupe Arreola, was stopped while driving in Mesa in September 2012; the police passed her information along to ICE. Three months later, ICE agents appeared at the family\u2019s home and took Arreola away in handcuffs. Andiola responded by flipping open her laptop and filming a video that she posted to social media. Within hours of her mother\u2019s arrest, the hashtags #WeAreAndiola and #SomosAndiola were rousing people over Facebook and Twitter. ICE\u2019s office in Phoenix was flooded with calls. Messages also poured into the Department of Homeland Security from Washington; hours before ICE had banged on her door, Andiola was hired by an Arizona congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next morning, as Arreola sat on a bus headed for Nogales, protesters rallied outside of ICE\u2019s Phoenix office, drawing television crews. The bus driver received a phone call. The bus turned around. A few hours later, Arreola was released with an order of supervision signed by ICE\u2019s field-office director, Katrina Kane. Jose Luis Pe\u00f1alosa, the lawyer who represented Arreola at the time, believes the directive to reverse the deportation must have come directly from Washington.\n\nUnder Obama, Andiola told me, the primary strategy had been to create a well-publicized \u201cmoral dilemma\u201d between Obama\u2019s pro-immigrant rhetoric and his aggressive immigration enforcement \u2014 exactly what she had done with her mother. Such dilemmas could provoke ICE to use prosecutorial discretion to stop a removal.\n\nBy 2014, however, such maneuvers rarely worked. After Obama won re-election and Democrats lost the midterms, Washington was less susceptible to public shaming. Phone campaigns and news conferences no longer resulted in release. \u201cWe got to a point where the legal strategy, the political strategy wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Andiola said, \u201cso we had to begin using our bodies in civil disobedience.\u201d In August 2013, ADAC stopped an ICE bus full of deportees in Phoenix, delaying their removal. In 2014 Andiola and Garcia were arrested together during a hunger strike outside ICE\u2019s field office.\n\nBy then Andiola had left her leadership position at ADAC, whose board at that time disapproved of its members\u2019 involvement in non-Dreamer cases. She also abandoned the job as a congressional staffer, frustrated by the lack of movement on comprehensive immigration reform. When people facing deportation petitioned her for help, as scores did through Facebook, she sent them to Puente, which her own mother joined. \u201cPuente and us were trying to do the same thing with parents,\u201d Andiola said. ADAC could no longer help them, but Puente would.\n\nPhoto\n\nLate on the night of Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s protest, after the chants stopped and the crowd dwindled to a handful of private conversations, an ADAC veteran asked Andiola how she thought she might handle her own mother\u2019s check-in with ICE in May. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Andiola snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d A few weeks later at a Puente meeting, when Porchas asked how she was doing, Andiola simply began crying. Andiola walked over the desert into Arizona with her mother in 1998, when she was 11, primarily to escape her father. He was an abusive alcoholic, she said, with a taste for firing guns indoors. He was still alive in Durango; Arreola was terrified of seeing him again.\n\nBut after what happened with Garc\u00eda Aguilar, Andiola knew that the tactics she used to stave off her mother\u2019s deportation in 2013 would no longer work. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen,\u201d Andiola said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to care.\u201d The week ICE deported Garc\u00eda Aguilar, more than 600 undocumented immigrants were picked up in raids across the country. This in itself wasn\u2019t unusual: ICE surges had occurred many times during Obama\u2019s presidency, including, notoriously, over New Year\u2019s weekend 2016. Yet because Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had promised millions of deportations, the surge could now be spun as a change in federal policy. Trump himself basked in the news. \u201cThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise,\u201d he tweeted that Sunday. \u201cGang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had these really broad laws so what the history really is about is what the executive wants to enforce,\u201d Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at U.C.L.A., told me, recalling the Palmer Red Raids of 1919 and 1920 and the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s. \u201cRight now, we see the swing of the pendulum back to the harshest possible interpretation.\u201d The velocity of this swing is possible because most of the victories achieved by the undocumented during Obama\u2019s administration depended upon the use of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Prosecutorial discretion was exposed only after President Richard Nixon tried to throw John Lennon, the former Beatle, out of the country before the 1972 elections. (Nixon feared that Lennon, who opposed the war in Vietnam, might turn younger voters against him.) In the course of defending Lennon \u2014 as the Penn State law professor Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia details in her book, \u201cBeyond Deportation\u201d \u2014 his lawyer, Leon Wildes, unearthed a trove of documents proving the existence of a hidden \u201cdeferred action\u201d program, which allowed immigration officials to use prosecutorial discretion to grant \u201cnonpriority\u201d status to individuals on humanitarian grounds. After Wildes spotlighted the program, he won deferred action for Lennon, allowing one of the world\u2019s most famous musicians to stay in the United States long enough to gain lawful permanent residence.\n\nUntil Obama came into office, gaining \u201cdeferred action\u201d or \u201cnonpriority\u201d status required the help of a savvy immigration lawyer. \u201cI used to call it the invisible sword,\u201d Wadhia told me, noting that, outside the DACA program, there has never been any official form to fill out or fee to pay in order to win deferred action. Obama did not invent prosecutorial discretion, but he did make it more transparent and accessible, standing in the Rose Garden to announce how his administration had used it to create a deferred-action program for Dreamers. Trump cannot destroy prosecutorial discretion \u2014 it\u2019s what allows a district attorney to ignore shoplifting so she can focus on murders \u2014 but his administration can pressure ICE officials to resist appeals to exercise it favorably.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what many believe has happened. In the past, when Washington-based officials pressured ICE supervisors to reverse decisions, as seems to have happened in Arreola\u2019s case, ICE agents had little recourse. Even immigration judges could find their orders for deportation halted by prosecutorial discretion, as in the case of Garc\u00eda Aguilar. But those roadblocks have been undone. \u201cSome 60,000 agents, they have been chafing at prosecutorial-discretion memos,\u201d Paromita Shah, the associate director of the National Immigration Project, told me in November.\n\nIn fact, Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation was just the first of many cases in which undocumented residents who were granted nonpriority status found themselves deported when they appeared for routine check-ins. ICE now commonly instructs people to appear for check-ins with passports, which makes their deportation easier. With prosecutorial discretion held out of reach, Garcia told me, \u201conce ICE decides to deport someone, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get them out of their grasp.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly the situation that Andiola feared when we met for coffee on a cold, drizzly day last November. Many of the cases that activists won under Obama, she said, weren\u2019t actually closed; they were merely suspended through prosecutorial discretion. \u201cThe judge says, \u2018I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not going to deport you, but I\u2019m going to put your file away and you can just stay,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThose cases are easy to just open up again.\u201d In April, ICE officially reopened her own mother\u2019s file, sending Arreola a letter ordering her to report for removal at its Phoenix field office on May 3. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to change for me, for my life,\u201d Arreola told me, weeping, the day after the letter arrived. \u201cAy, I don\u2019t want to cry, I don\u2019t want to cry, I don\u2019t want to cry.\u201d\n\nOn a blazing afternoon this May, signs lay stacked in piles throughout Puente\u2019s large meeting room. Blue hummingbirds on one sign flew through the words \u201cResist!\u201d \u201c\u00a1Resiste!\u201d; on another, Aztec gods pointed like Uncle Sam over the question \u201cWho you calling illegal, Pilgrim?\u201d Sitting at a plastic table amid the slogans, her hair braided in preparation for a long march through high heat, Maria Castro, an ADAC veteran who had become a Puente organizer, explained to me how Puente\u2019s strategy had shifted in the months since the effort to save Garc\u00eda Aguilar failed. With a black crayon, she drew six boxes in a row, each symbolizing a stage in the deportation process: police, city court, prison, ICE, immigration court, deportation. Before Trump, she said, Puente had focused its efforts on stopping deportations at ICE or after. But now that Trump had vacated Obama\u2019s priorities and reduced the likelihood of prosecutorial discretion, \u201ceverything from city court forward no longer works.\u201d She drew a red line through five of the boxes, leaving only one unscathed: the initial point of police contact.\n\nAfter Arpaio fully lost his 287(g) status in 2011 amid allegations of abuse, he allowed ICE to install an agent inside central booking at the Fourth Avenue Jail in Phoenix. Because that agent could question anyone charged with any offense right after fingerprinting, Castro told me, most undocumented people who are arrested in Maricopa County have an ICE hold on them by the time they are arraigned. Last year, ICE requested the detention of 3,483 people in Maricopa County jails. The signs lying around the room were for Puente\u2019s May Day march, the theme of which was \u201cICE out of Fourth Avenue.\u201d\n\nLast fall many assumed that Trump would instigate huge roundups of the undocumented, \u00e1 la Operation Wetback. Yet so far, the process for deportations in Arizona has mostly followed the pattern set by Arpaio; the undocumented are first caught by the police. (Nationally, however, ICE\u2019s noncriminal arrests have increased 157 percent compared to the first four months of 2016.) \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to do much to deport anyone he wants to because Obama has already built this machinery for him,\u201d Garcia told me. Under Obama, 287(g) agreements proliferated. In 2006, ICE was allocated $5 million to implement such agreements. A year into Obama\u2019s first term, that number shot up to $68 million, though it was reduced to $24 million in 2014.\n\nObama also beefed up ICE\u2019s power by expanding the Bush-era information-sharing network known as Secure Communities. In 2009, Secure Communities connected only 88 jurisdictions to ICE. By 2013, ICE was linked to every jurisdiction in the nation. What difference does such an expansion make? When Arreola was taken to a police station after her traffic stop in 2012, she refused to answer the questions. Are you a citizen of the United States? Do you have a Social Security number? Were you born in Mexico? But when her fingerprints were run through ICE\u2019s database, they got a hit. \u201cBe nice,\u201d Arreola recalls one officer saying sarcastically in English, as he held up a piece of paper with her mug shot on it. The photo had been taken in 1998, after her first, failed attempted to enter the United States.\n\nObama deported nearly three million undocumented immigrants, more than any president in American history. For Puente, one of the stranger outcomes of Trump\u2019s election is that, for the first time, they stand a chance of dismantling some police-ICE collaborations. Fighting individual deportation cases has become harder, but policy battles have gained traction in Phoenix, where Democrats still hold significant power. \u201cNow it\u2019s convenient for Democrats to shame a deportation,\u201d Garcia told me.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder Obama, he speculated, many Democrats were reluctant to oppose any of the president\u2019s policies. Under Trump, they saw political advantage in talking about deportations, sanctuary cities and immigrant rights \u2014 especially now that the undocumented had found new allies. When Garcia helped assemble the coalition United Against Hate after Trump\u2019s victory in November, 56 groups signed up. That same month, Paul Penzone defeated Joe Arpaio at the polls. For Garcia, who began his activism under President George W. Bush, one great lesson of the past eight years is that Democrats are unreliable allies, willing to place other policy goals, like the Affordable Care Act, above the needs of the undocumented. \u201cNeither party is our friend,\u201d he said. But the two-party system, he knew, could be played to Puente\u2019s advantage as it pushed for Phoenix to do more cite-and-release actions instead of arrests and as it argued for school boards to reduce the number of police officers in schools.\n\nNone of these policy advances could save someone already facing deportation. That May Day, Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s family joined hundreds of protesters for Puente\u2019s march from Arizona\u2019s Capitol to the Fourth Avenue Jail. Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s daughter, Jacqueline, and Arreola spoke at the final rally. \u201cWith ICE there\u2019s now no right or wrong,\u201d Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s husband told me, as the crowd marched around the jail three times, losing more people with each turn. His wife had decided not to hide from ICE, he said, because living on the lam \u201cno es vida.\u201d But as time goes by, he finds her absence more and more difficult. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s better not to show up.\u201d\n\nI heard anecdotal accounts that more people were, in fact, choosing the option that his wife had declined. Some were moving to new addresses. Others were looking for sanctuary in churches or simply shutting themselves up in their homes, essentially becoming fugitives when their check-ins passed. The full extent of these changes won\u2019t be clear until this summer, said Petra Falcon, the executive director of Promise Arizona (PAZ). During past crises in Arizona, she said, undocumented parents had often waited for classes to end before moving with their children. But a recent report from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System showed that the percentage of Hispanics participating in Arizona\u2019s state health care system had fallen by more than half between October 2016 and April 2017. Some Hispanics, it appeared, might be trying to retreat into the shadows again.\n\nTrump\u2019s Jan. 25 orders have made the concept of a single national strategy to stop deportations irrelevant. Under Obama, ICE\u2019s prosecutorial priorities were consistent from state to state because they were clearly defined by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE in Washington. Trump\u2019s orders, however, expanded prosecutorial priorities so broadly that, as a practical matter, there no longer exist any priorities at all. Steve Legomsky, the former chief counsel of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (U.S.C.I.S.), told me that, effectively, \u201cthe decision of what to prioritize is now left in the hands of each individual ICE agent and each individual C.B.P. border-patrol officer.\u201d Much has been made of the fact that Trump has essentially ceded America\u2019s military strategy to its generals. His handling of ICE, whose field directors now set the agency\u2019s direction, appears similar.\n\nLegomsky said that the sweep of Trump\u2019s priorities has also given ICE cover for the use of targeted deportations against activists. The agency doesn\u2019t need to explain why the deportation of a DACA activist or an undocumented organizer is consistent with their announced priorities, he said, \u201cif the announced priorities cover almost everybody.\u201d In February, the Department of Homeland Security seemed to give its blessing for such retaliations when it issued a memo that gave ICE officers the authority to prioritize the deportation of anyone they believed posed \u201ca risk to public safety.\u201d Andiola, who is now the political director of Our Revolution, the 501(c)(4) that sprang from Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential bid, didn\u2019t know if her mother had been targeted or if the letter ordering her to report for removal was simply a consequence of Trump\u2019s redefined priorities.\n\nAfter Arreola received the letter, Andiola worked her extensive professional network, calling organizers, lawyers and activists to gather opinions about what she should do. \u201cIt\u2019s great that there are so many perspectives,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s difficult to sort through all the differing kinds of advice.\u201d Eventually, she realized there was no single solution. With a diversity of tactics in her pocket, she would deploy one after another in hopes of reaching success. What she needed first, she decided, was a legal strategy.\n\nEven though Arreola fled to the United States to escape domestic abuse, it never occurred to either woman that Arreola might be eligible for asylum. In Andiola\u2019s mind, asylum seekers came from Central America or the Middle East, places with extreme political turmoil. After Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation, though, Andiola began to take the option seriously. She knew it was a long shot: It has never been easy for Mexicans to gain asylum in the United States. And though several lawyers told me that asylum applications are now rising, the process is likely to become even more difficult soon. The Jan. 25 order on border security includes an entire section declaring Trump\u2019s intention \u201cto end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same political agenda that is behind banning Muslims and refugees from coming to the U.S.,\u201d says Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nA successful asylum application, Andiola learned, depended upon documentary evidence. Arreola recalled that a newspaper in Durango once published her ex-partner\u2019s photograph, noting that he had been charged for the kidnapping and rape of a minor: her. In Durango, Arreola\u2019s brother-in-law found a copy of a 1991 police report detailing one of her ex-partner\u2019s rages. These two documents formed the backbone of the asylum application Arreola used to request an interview with U.S.C.I.S. in April. Within a week, she had an appointment for a \u201creasonable fear\u201d interview to determine if her case merited serious consideration. Three days after the interview, Arreola received good news: ICE had canceled her scheduled removal on May 3. She had passed the interview, the first of many steps in gaining asylum. Her lawyer, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, who also represents Garc\u00eda Aguilar, says there is still a fair chance that Arreola\u2019s application for asylum may be denied, but she was now safe to report for her check-in on May 23.\n\nOn May 3, the day Arreola was to have been deported, Arreola and Andiola gathered with friends, family and supporters for a prayer breakfast at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Phoenix, which had offered to house Arreola if she chose sanctuary. Pastor James Pennington had been active in the fight for gay rights. The patio of First Congregational was decorated with several flags, including a rainbow flag, an Arizona state flag and an American flag. Inside the church, members of Puente and former members of ADAC formed a circle with several non-Hispanics who had only recently allied themselves with the undocumented. Standing together they recited Psalm 30 in Spanish:\n\nTe ensalzar\u00e9, oh Se\u00f1or, porque me has elevado, y no has permitido que mis enemigos se r\u00edan de mi.\n\nI\u2019ll praise you, Lord, because you\u2019ve lifted me up. You haven\u2019t let my enemies laugh at me.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet their enemies remained hard at work. A week later, Marco Tulio Coss Ponce, who had been living in Arizona under an order of supervision since 2013, appeared at ICE\u2019s field office in Phoenix with his lawyer, Ravindar Arora, for a check-in. ICE officers, Arora said, knew that Coss Ponce was about to file an application for asylum \u2014 several of his relatives had been recently killed or threatened by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico \u2014 and they had assured Arora several times that Coss Ponce would not be removed. They said he simply needed to wear an ankle monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t disappear. The fitting was delayed several times until finally Arora had to leave to argue a case in court. After he departed, ICE officers handcuffed Coss Ponce and put him in a van, alone. Three hours later, he was in Nogales.", "publish_date": "2017-05-23", "authors": "Marcela Valdes", "type": "article"}
