{"title": "Both Feeling Threatened, American Muslims and Jews Join Hands", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/us/muslim-jewish-alliance-after-trump.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cWhen did you know it was time to leave?\u201d Ms. Firdaus asked one woman who had just recounted how her relatives had fled the Nazis. \u201cThe ones that didn\u2019t leave are the ones who went to Auschwitz.\u201d\n\nThe Jewish women tried to convince her that they would not let it come to that. \u201cIf Muslims have to register, we\u2019re all going to register,\u201d said Mahela Morrow-Jones, who is helping to build the first West Coast chapter of the Sisterhood in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe it, sister.\u201d\n\nGroups are reaching out not just to clergy members, but also to laypeople, including business executives, students and women.\n\nPhoto\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a recent interview: \u201cJews know what it means to be identified and tagged, to be registered and pulled aside. It evokes very deep emotions in the Jewish community.\u201d\n\nMr. Greenblatt received a standing ovation when he declared at his organization\u2019s conference in Manhattan last month that if Muslims were ever forced to register, \u201cthat is the day that this proud Jew will register as a Muslim.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us have heard the story of the Danish king who said if his country\u2019s Jews had to wear a gold star,\u201d he said, \u201call of Denmark would, too.\u201d\n\nNearly 500 Muslim and Jewish women, many wearing head scarves and skullcaps, gathered on Sunday at Drew University in Madison, N.J., in what organizers said was the largest such meeting ever held in the United States. It was the third annual conference of the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a grass-roots group that now claims 50 chapters in more than 20 states. The first conference two years ago drew only 100 people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe women spread out inside an enormous sports complex and met in clusters to study sacred texts on the racquetball courts, practice self-defense techniques in the dance studio and, in the bleachers, discuss how to talk to friends whose impression of Islam had been shaped entirely by news of terrorist attacks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sisterhood chapters keep track of the incidents on their Facebook pages and other social media.\n\n\u201cIgnorance is one of the key triggers of hate,\u201d said Sheryl Olitzky, the group\u2019s executive director, in her opening remarks. \u201cWe need to show the world that we are Americans. We are here because we love each other and we\u2019re overcoming hate.\u201d\n\nMs. Olitzky, a marketing executive whose husband and two sons are rabbis, started the first Sisterhood women\u2019s meeting in New Jersey six years ago on the theory that \u201cwomen navigate the world through relationships.\u201d She baked the challah and hosted the Shabbat dinner on Friday night at her home.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Sisterhood is one of several groups expanding their work on Muslim-Jewish relations: The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding started an initiative to elevate Muslim condemnations of terrorism, which are often ignored by the news media. The Anti-Defamation League is increasing its work against anti-Muslim bigotry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Trump effect,\u201d said Imam Abdullah Antepli, the chief representative on Muslim affairs at Duke University, who attended the women\u2019s conference with his wife. \u201cI see the Muslim community even more eager to reach out and to put aside the grievances of the past.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent new initiative is a Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council whose co-chairmen are Fortune 500 chief executives: Farooq Kathwari, of the furniture company Ethan Allen, who is Muslim, and Stanley Bergman, of the medical products distributor Henry Schein, who is Jewish.\n\nThe council, which was forming as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was gaining steam, includes both Democrats and Republicans. It was created by leaders of the American Jewish Committee and the Islamic Society of North America in an effort to have influence on public policy. The group intends to oppose a registry, support immigrants and refugees, and push for accommodating religious practices in the workplace.\n\nDespite the new cooperation, tensions over Israel continue to flare up. Several Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, recently declared their opposition to a bid by Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is a Muslim, to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, because of critical statements he has made about Israel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the embrace of Muslims is hardly universal. A few Jewish groups have applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on Muslims, and cheered his choice of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn to be national security adviser. The retired general has called Islam \u201ca cancer\u201d and a \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d masquerading as a faith.\n\nThe selection of General Flynn prompted the usually stoic Ms. Firdaus to rethink her situation. She abandoned the plan to buy a vacation home in Tampa, or anywhere in the United States, at least for now. Instead, she and her family will spend Christmas vacation in Toronto, where they intend to open a bank account and look for a condominium to buy \u2014 just in case they have to flee.\n\nAttending the Sisterhood conference on Sunday, however, Ms. Firdaus said she was feeling a bit more optimistic. She was surrounded by Jews who pledged not to abandon Muslims. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, brought the women to their feet cheering with stories of how in history\u2019s darkest times, love had conquered hate.\n\n\u201cSitting here makes you feel it\u2019s really not so hopeless. This is food for the soul,\u201d Ms. Firdaus said. \u201cBut there were 60 million people who voted for Trump. I\u2019m not ready to leave, but you have to have a plan.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-12-05", "authors": "Laurie Goodstein", "type": "article"}
