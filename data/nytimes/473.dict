Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\n\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, in a memo to staff.\n\n\n\nA significant part of the tech community, which relies on highly skilled immigrants, went to the barricades after Mr. Trump signed the executive order. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley, the heart of the industry, came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did.\n\nAmong the big tech companies, Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia have been the most vocal, declaring support for the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office, which is suing in federal court to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAirbnb, Uber, Lyft, Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and a host of others have said that they oppose the ban or have expressed concerns about the implications of the order.\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the most notable reactions came from Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6. Mr. Brin was seen attending an impromptu protest on Saturday night at San Francisco International Airport.\n\n\n\n@karaswisher look who joined the protest at SFO pic.twitter.com/tCfm6CS0n7\n\n\u2014 Sina Vaziri (@SinaVaziri) January 29, 2017", "authors": "The New York Times", "type": "article", "title": "Starbucks, Exxon, Apple: Companies Challenging (or Silent on) Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban"}
