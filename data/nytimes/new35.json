And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\n\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we\u2019re all going to win. Both countries, we\u2019re all going to win.\n\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And in a Trump administration we\u2019re going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it\u2019s going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren\u2019t known because the media won\u2019t report on them. The politicians won\u2019t talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That\u2019s the way it is.\n\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It\u2019s all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn\u2019t serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. But if we\u2019re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it\u2019s impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\n\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it\u2019s just not going to work out. It\u2019s our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\n\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he\u2019s out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\n\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open-border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\n\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\n\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\n\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\n\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\n\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\n\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\n\nAnd they\u2019re hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\n\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they\u2019re treated better than our vets.\n\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be \u2014 and honestly we\u2019ve been hearing that number for years. It\u2019s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be three million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\n\nFrankly our government has no idea what they\u2019re doing on many, many fronts, folks.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut whatever the number, that\u2019s never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn\u2019t matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America \u2014 you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don\u2019t have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it\u2019s not nuclear, and it\u2019s not ISIS, it\u2019s not Russia, it\u2019s not China, it\u2019s global warming.\n\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she\u2019s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\n\nNo, she\u2019s only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\n\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\n\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\n\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what\u2019s going to happen, folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\n\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you\u2019ve heard about Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn\u2019t want to get into the quagmire. It\u2019s a tough one, she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI also worked with lawmakers, who\u2019ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I\u2019ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\n\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!\n\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOne hundred percent. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it. And they\u2019re great people and great leaders but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall.\n\nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that\u2019s the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I\u2019m sure they will.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd they\u2019ll be brought great distances. We\u2019re not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They\u2019d drop them across, right across, and they\u2019d come back. And across.\n\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, O.K.?\n\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it\u2019s so great. It\u2019s hard to believe, people don\u2019t even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nZero. They don\u2019t come in here. They don\u2019t come in here.\n\nAccording to federal data, there are at least two million, two million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, two million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\n\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect \u2014 say hello to the police. Boy, they don\u2019t get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They\u2019re great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\n\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can\u2019t do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn\u2019t like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They\u2019re gone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond the two million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They\u2019re going to be gone. It will be over.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThey\u2019re going out. They\u2019re going out fast.\n\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\n\nWe will terminate the Obama administration\u2019s deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\n\nThat\u2019s over. That\u2019s over, folks. That\u2019s over.\n\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn\u2019t have been politically correct.\n\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don\u2019t even know about.\n\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\n\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There\u2019s no common sense, there\u2019s no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\n\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate\u2019s Law, named for Kate Steinle...\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd then we get them out.\n\nAnother reform I\u2019m proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They\u2019re going to go.\n\nWe\u2019re going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, O.K.?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe they\u2019ll be able to deport her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don\u2019t have to be abused by these thugs anymore.\n\nThere\u2019s no great mystery to it, they\u2019ve put up with it for years, and now finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\n\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\n\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\n\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don\u2019t forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don\u2019t forget your Second Amendment. And don\u2019t forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget building up our depleted military. And don\u2019t forget taking care of our vets. Don\u2019t forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nClinton\u2019s plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\n\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who\u2019ve come here under this current corrupt administration.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country.\n\nOur country is a mess. We don\u2019t even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(BOOING)\n\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\n\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It\u2019s going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that\u2019s fine but they\u2019re going to be good. It\u2019s extreme.\n\nAnd if people don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ve got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. It\u2019s going to end badly folks. It\u2019s going to end very, very badly.\n\nFor the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we\u2019ll get the money from Gulf states. We don\u2019t want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\n\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We\u2019ll supervise it. We\u2019ll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\n\nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. We\u2019re very proud of our country. Aren\u2019t we? Really? With all it\u2019s going through, we\u2019re very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we\u2019ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That\u2019s what they say.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat\u2019s what they say. They\u2019re justified. Right? And we\u2019re admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they\u2019ve been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won\u2019t take them back. So we say, O.K., we\u2019ll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick\u2019s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries.\n\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\n\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don\u2019t.\n\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\n\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\n\nWe\u2019re like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nAnd Arizona knows better than most exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\n\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\n\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it\u2019s always the wrong decision. You ever notice?\n\nIn my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\n\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody\u2019s telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we\u2019ll take care of you.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose \u2014 and they really are a big problem \u2014 pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas.\n\nAnd you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn\u2019t that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant.\n\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that\u2019s what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\n\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\n\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\n\nImmigration law doesn\u2019t exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\n\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\n\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We\u2019re going to take care of our workers.\n\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we\u2019re going to make great trade deals. We\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home. We\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home.\n\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with Nafta. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\n\nWe\u2019re going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble for them. It\u2019s not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They\u2019re not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It\u2019s not going to happen. There will be consequences.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe\u2019ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\n\nWe\u2019ve had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\n\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\n\nYou know, folks, it\u2019s called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it\u2019s called America first. Remember that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn\u2019t that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She\u2019s going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she\u2019ll say, so long, see you in four years. That\u2019s what it is.\n\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She\u2019s done nothing. She\u2019s been there for 35 years. She\u2019s done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we\u2019re going to do together. Watch.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We\u2019ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They\u2019re decades and decades old.\n\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They\u2019re archaic. They\u2019re ancient. We wouldn\u2019t put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\n\nSo let\u2019s now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It\u2019s going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I\u2019ve spent a lot of money on my campaign, I\u2019ll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\n\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We\u2019ll do it right. You\u2019ll be proud of our country again. We\u2019ll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\n\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We\u2019re going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\n\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry \u2014\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system \u2014 and it will be an efficient system \u2014 will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.TRUMP: We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can\u2019t do it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can\u2019t just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It\u2019s not going to work that way. Those days are over.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\n\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRight now, however, we\u2019re in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\n\nWhether it\u2019s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton\u2019s answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nShe didn\u2019t go to Louisiana. She didn\u2019t go to Mexico. She was invited.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won\u2019t like what you\u2019re hearing.\n\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, as sure as you\u2019re standing there.\n\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt\u2019s our last chance. It\u2019s our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that. So I want to remind everyone what we\u2019re fighting for and who we are fighting for.\n\nI am going to ask \u2014 these are really special people that I\u2019ve gotten to know. I\u2019m going to ask all of the \u201cAngel Moms\u201d to come join me on the stage right now.\n\nThese are amazing women.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThese are amazing people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\n\nI\u2019ve become friends with so many. But Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy, lost his son so violently. Say just a few words about your child.\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): My son Ronald da Silva (ph) was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what so \u2014 makes me so outrageous is that we came here legally.\n\nThank you, Mr. Trump. I totally support you. You have my vote.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, thank you.\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): God bless you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: You know what? Name your child and come right by. Go ahead.\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): Laura Wilkerson. And my son was Joshua Wilkerson. He was murdered by an illegal in 2010. And I personally support Mr. Trump for our next president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): My name is Ruth Johnston Martin (ph). My husband was shot by an illegal alien. He fought the good fight but he took his last breath in 2002. And I support this man who\u2019s going to change this country for the better. God bless you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): My name Maureen Maloney (ph), and our son Matthew Denise (ph) was 23 years old when he was dragged a quarter of a mile to his death by an illegal alien, while horrified witnesses were banging on the truck trying to stop him.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): Our son Matthew Denise, if Donald Trump were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denise and other Americans would be alive today.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): Thank you. My name is Kathy Woods (ph). My son Steve (ph), a high school senior, 17 years old, went to the beach after a high school football game. A local gang came along, nine members. The cars were battered to \u2014 like war in Beirut. And all I can say is they murdered him and if Mr. Trump had been in office then the border would have been secure and our children would not be dead today.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): Hi. My name is Brenda Sparks (ph), and my son is named Eric Zapeda (ph). He was raised by a legal immigrant from Honduras only to be murdered by an illegal in 2011. His murderer never did a second in handcuffs or jail. Got away with killing an American. So I\u2019m voting for trump. And by the way, so is my mother.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): My name is Dee Angle (ph). My cousin Rebecca Ann Johnston (ph), known as Becky, was murdered on January the 1st, 1989 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you. And if you don\u2019t vote Trump, we won\u2019t have a country. Trump all the way.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): I\u2019m Shannon Estes (ph). And my daughter Shaley Estes (ph), 22 years old, was murdered here in Phoenix last July 24 by a Russian who overstayed his visa. And vote Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): I\u2019m Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, who was killed in a violent head-on collision in Mesa.\n\nThank you.\n\nI want to thank Phoenix for the support you\u2019ve always given me, and I want to tell you what. I\u2019m supporting the man who will \u2014 who is the only man who is going to save our country, and what we our going to be leaving our children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(SPEAKER\u2019S VOICE): I\u2019m Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant Ronnebeck, 21 years old. Killed January 22, 2015 by an illegal immigrant who shot him in the face. I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things. He\u2019s going to fight for my family, and he\u2019s going to fight for America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I\u2019ve gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they\u2019re going through is incredible, and there\u2019s just no reason for it. Let\u2019s give them a really tremendous hand.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat\u2019s tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\n\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\n\nLet\u2019s fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let\u2019s our secure our border.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet\u2019s stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let\u2019s protect our social security and Medicare. Let\u2019s get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\n\nThis has been an incredible evening. We\u2019re going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\n\nWe\u2019re going to bring \u2014 thank you, thank you. We\u2019re going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We\u2019re going to take our country back.\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you.\n\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven\u2019t been looking to what\u2019s been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTogether we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we\u2019re going to make America great again.\n\nThank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you.
