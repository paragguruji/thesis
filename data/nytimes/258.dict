{"title": "Activism Hits Even the Less Flashy Tech Companies", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/technology/trump-tech-company-employees.html?mcubz=0", "text": "At IBM, a petition has been circulating that proclaims, \u201cWe have a moral and business imperative to uphold the pillars of a free society by declining any projects which undermine liberty.\u201d The organizers say nearly 1,000 verified employees have signed.\n\nThis is a delicate subject for big tech companies, none more than Big Blue. Mr. Trump during the campaign explored the idea of a Muslim database, although his remarks were inconclusive. IBM\u2019s punch-card technology, as detailed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, was used by the Nazis in 1939 to do a census. That data, in turn, led directly to Adolf Eichmann\u2019s Jewish Registry.\n\nAt Oracle, the Silicon Valley database giant whose first customer was the Central Intelligence Agency, three young women \u2014 none of whom has worked there for more than a handful of months \u2014 started a petition last week to encourage the company to join the amicus brief. Hundreds of Oracle employees have signed it.\n\n\u201cIn some instances it is notable for a company to take a stand on an issue,\u201d said one of the women, Irene Scher, a regional vice president of sales. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s notable not to have taken a stand.\u201d\n\nA co-chief executive of Oracle, Safra Catz, and the chief executive of IBM, Virginia Rometty, became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition. \u201cI know that you are committed to help America\u2019s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people,\u201d Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November. Ms. Catz said in December, \u201cWe are with him and will help in any way we can.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe three friends who created the Oracle petition joined the company in August, when it acquired the company they worked for, Opower. They emphasize they are not at odds with their employer.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a criticism of Oracle,\u201d said one of them, Rachel Kane, a sales executive at Oracle Utilities. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company feel.\u201d Oracle declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth petitions echo the Never Again pledge, which nearly 3,000 tech workers publicly committed to during eight days in December. Signers agreed not to participate in the creation of any government database that would target individuals based on race, religion or national origin. Five of the nine people listed on NeverAgain.tech as having worked to create the pledge, including the lead organizer, are women.\n\nCauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM, said she believed \u201cworkplaces have a responsibility to society \u2014 to the clients we serve, the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions.\u201d She said IBM had been \u201cprogressive\u201d in encouraging women\u2019s participation in technology and on other issues, but had not delivered on the immigration ban.\n\n\u201cIBM\u2019s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and condemn this policy is extremely disturbing,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Hewlett Packard Enterprise, employees have been asking why it did not sign the amicus brief. Meg Whitman, the chief executive, responded Friday that \u201csimply, we were not contacted to participate.\u201d She indicated the company would be taking a more assertive role: \u201cYou can expect to see us add our voice.\u201d\n\nDell and Cisco declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement: Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a handful of cases, people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president.\n\n\u201cActivists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer,\u201d Mr. Musk responded on Twitter. \u201cHow could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?\u201d\n\nMr. Musk said he had made sure that the travel ban was discussed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d at a Feb. 3 White House meeting. A spokeswoman said no further details were available.\n\nThe answer did not satisfy everyone. As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter: \u201cYou are not advising Trump, you are giving him cover and validating his nonsense. You can do more good by taking a stand. Please.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIBM released a statement that said Ms. Rometty had \u201cconveyed the company\u2019s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security\u201d on Feb. 3, \u201cincluding suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEd Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM, said no further details were available. He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of a Muslim registry. He declined to comment on the petition.\n\nWhen a small group of IBM employees was drawing up the petition in November, it debated including a reference to the Nazis. IBM maintains that the accounts of its role in Hitler\u2019s regime are overblown and incendiary.\n\nThe employees decided to refer to the episode obliquely but focus on a more positive example \u2014 the company president Thomas J. Watson Jr.\u2019s Policy Letter No. 4, which resisted pro-segregation policies in the South in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cWatson sacrificed short-term business interests in order to be on the right side of history, something IBM takes pride in today,\u201d the petition says.\n\nDaniel Hanley, one of the organizers, said the goal was \u201cto build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values, and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies.\u201d\n\nGeorge A. Polisner, who worked in cloud services at Oracle, took his stand in December. He posted a resignation letter on LinkedIn, saying that unlike Ms. Catz, he was not there to \u201chelp\u201d Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was on a Monday. Mr. Polisner told his boss that he would work through Friday. After the letter became public, Mr. Polisner was fired immediately. At 56, he said, he probably would have worked at Oracle for a few more years if politics had not intervened.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways to influence,\u201d Mr. Polisner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision. I chose this one.\u201d\n\nMs. Scher at Oracle and her friends chose another.\n\n\u201cWe all participated in the Women\u2019s March,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible we\u2019re feeling a heightened sense of civic responsibility.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "authors": "David Streitfeld", "type": "article"}
