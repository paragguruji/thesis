But in a separate action the day before, Judge Amon ordered the government to explain in writing by mid-February why she should not allow Dr. Abushamma to return to the United States, where the doctor is engaged to be married to a fellow physician.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs described Dr. Abushamma\u2019s detention and deportation during Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\nFour days before Mr. Trump signed the executive order, Dr. Abushamma had flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to spend time with her family. Her apartment, her car and all of her belongings \u2014 save the few that she had packed for her vacation \u2014 were still in Cleveland. But when she landed at Kennedy Airport on Jan. 28, she was detained by customs agents and not allowed to continue on to Cleveland, according to the papers filed on Thursday.\n\nDr. Abushamma, the papers said, was held for more than six hours at the airport, as arguments were being held in Judge Donnelly\u2019s courtroom. And although her immigration lawyer tried to explain to customs agents that the judge was about to rule, the lawyer was ignored, the papers said. She was escorted onto a plane headed back to Saudi Arabia by two customs officials.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Though lawyers say they have repeatedly asked the government for a detailed list of those who were both detained and deported since the ruling went into effect, federal officials have not yet provided one. The government has said that no immigrants are currently in custody, but lawyers say that could be because some of them have already been improperly sent back to their homelands.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely we have found the entire universe of people who have been removed,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued for the immigrants at the hearing. Mr. Gelernt said that he would give the government another chance to furnish him with a list of detainees and those who were deported, but he added that if federal officials did not provide the list within \u201ca short time\u201d \u2014 perhaps as early as Friday \u2014 he would consider filing a contempt of court complaint against the administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe case may emerge as the first of its kind to decide whether the Trump administration disobeyed Judge Donnelly\u2019s ruling to keep legal visa holders in the country.\n\nSamuel Go, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said at the hearing that the government planned to file a motion to dismiss the entire case challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which, so far, has not been subject to a ruling on broad constitutional grounds.\n\nWhile Mr. Gelernt and his colleagues have opposed the order, saying that it violates due process rights and discriminates against Muslims in contravention of the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause, they have not yet had the opportunity to make those arguments in court.\n\nGiven that most of the travelers detained by the government have already been released, possibly rendering their legal efforts moot, Dr. Abushamma\u2019s claims may provide the plaintiffs with an opportunity to attack the basic legal foundations of the executive order.\n\n\u201cWhen she left to visit her family, she had no idea that she would become ensnared in the chaos following President Trump\u2019s issuance of an unconstitutional and unlawful Executive Order,\u201d her papers say. \u201cNor did Dr. Abushamma ever imagine then that, as a valid visa-holder living and working legally in the United States, she would be barred from reentry to the United States and unlawfully removed to Saudi Arabia.\u201d", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["dr", "doctor", "executive", "ruling", "trump", "papers", "challenge", "judge", "cleveland", "abushamma", "order", "legal", "broad", "mr", "center", "say"], "summary": "Four days before Mr. Trump signed the executive order, Dr. Abushamma had flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to spend time with her family.\nHer apartment, her car and all of her belongings \u2014 save the few that she had packed for her vacation \u2014 were still in Cleveland.\nDr. Abushamma, the papers said, was held for more than six hours at the airport, as arguments were being held in Judge Donnelly\u2019s courtroom.\n\u201cWhen she left to visit her family, she had no idea that she would become ensnared in the chaos following President Trump\u2019s issuance of an unconstitutional and unlawful Executive Order,\u201d her papers say.\n\u201cNor did Dr. Abushamma ever imagine then that, as a valid visa-holder living and working legally in the United States, she would be barred from reentry to the United States and unlawfully removed to Saudi Arabia.\u201d"}
