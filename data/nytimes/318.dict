Gorsuch, Judge Watson became the only federal judge of Native Hawaiian descent upon his confirmation in 2013.\n\nIn nominating him, Mr. Obama hailed him as a jurist who would help \u201censure that the judiciary resembles the nation it serves.\u201d In a questionnaire submitted to the Senate as part of the confirmation process, Judge Watson described his pro bono work representing Mexican workers and challenging a California school district\u2019s elections as racially discriminatory.\n\nSupporters of his nomination presented him as a distinctly Hawaiian success story: The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association highlighted his background as the son of a Honolulu police officer and local bank employee, who graduated from the private Kamehameha Schools and became the first college graduate in his family, attending Harvard College before Harvard Law.\n\nThroughout his screening by the Senate, which confirmed him unanimously, Hawaii\u2019s all-Democratic congressional delegation embraced the judge as a reflection of the state\u2019s unique diversity.\n\nThe state\u2019s political leaders have denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s order temporarily banning travel from six predominantly Muslim countries as close to the opposite. Doug Chin, Hawaii\u2019s attorney general, called it \u201cantithetical to Hawaii\u2019s state identity and spirit\u201d in a court filing, and likened it to the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\n\nIn siding so forcefully with Hawaii and imposing a nationwide freeze on Mr. Trump\u2019s order, Judge Watson surprised even some admirers with the scope and intensity of his opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to barring Mr. Trump from enforcing the travel ban, Judge Watson described Mr. Trump\u2019s past comments about Muslims as \u201cremarkable\u201d evidence that his order was motivated by animus toward a religious faith.\n\nThe decision, issued just hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban was to go into effect, drew a furious response from the president. At a campaign-style rally in Tennessee late Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused Judge Watson of acting \u201cfor political reasons\u201d and declared angrily that the ruling \u201cmakes us look weak.\u201d\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, who supported Judge Watson\u2019s nomination in 2013, said the decision was more pointed than he might have expected from Judge Watson based on his personal demeanor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In one case, he defended the federal government in a 2010 civil suit claiming that Customs and Border Protection agents in Honolulu had caused the death of an infant from American Samoa who was detained with his mother while traveling to obtain medical care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe wrote in his questionnaire that he had \u201csuccessfully argued that C.B.P.\u2019s actions at the airport could not have been the cause of the infant\u2019s death as a matter of Hawaii tort law.\u201d\n\nL. Richard Fried Jr., a Honolulu litigator who represented the plaintiffs in that lawsuit, said he had come away with an impression of Judge Watson as \u201cquite conservative, actually,\u201d at least where legal process was concerned. \u201cHe would not try to figure out a decision and then try to back into it,\u201d said Mr. Fried, who added that he supported Judge Watson\u2019s ruling on the travel ban.\n\nIn his nomination paperwork, Judge Watson also reported spending \u201chundreds of hours\u201d on pro bono work while practicing law in California, including on litigation involving \u201chuman trafficking, common law tort, and wage and hour claims on behalf of two Mexican nationals against a chain of Bay Area taquerias.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter extensive discovery, much of which was done in Spanish, we recovered significant sums for both plaintiffs and their families,\u201d Judge Watson wrote.\n\nHe also detailed pro bono work with the San Francisco Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights against a school district that had \u201cprevented the election of a Hispanic member for decades despite Hispanics constituting the majority of residents in the district.\u201d\n\nBut little in the record of his confirmation foreshadows a clash on the scale of his confrontation with Mr. Trump. And Judge Watson gave a decidedly modest answer to a written question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who asked him about the scope of a president\u2019s power to issue executive orders.\n\nJudge Watson said presidents typically had more latitude to issue orders that proceeded from actions taken by Congress, as well as on matters of national security.", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Alexander Burns", "type": "article"}
