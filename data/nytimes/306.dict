But States Are Trying.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/donald-trump-new-travel-ban.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Among the attorneys general backing Mr. Ferguson on Thursday were Eric T. Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachusetts, both of whom dropped separate litigation against Mr. Trump to join Mr. Ferguson\u2019s suit, and Ellen F. Rosenblum of Oregon. Mr. Ferguson and his colleagues, along with Attorney General Lori Swanson of Minnesota, are expected to file updated complaints aimed at taking down the new travel order in the coming days.\n\nThe attorney general of Hawaii, Doug Chin, who is also a Democrat, filed a separate lawsuit earlier this week challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Trump\u2019s adjusted order and asking a different court to prevent it from going into effect.\n\nThe White House has projected confidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s decree will survive the scrutiny of courts, after the rollout of his initial travel ban ended in a series of embarrassing legal defeats last month.\n\nSean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief spokesman, told reporters on Thursday that the White House was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with the defensibility of the new order. He said the administration was not concerned about the challenge filed by Hawaii.\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers have presented the travel regulations as an effort to protect national security and insist they are not motivated by religious discrimination, though Mr. Trump campaigned on banning Muslim travelers from entering the country.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident with how that was crafted and the input that was given,\u201d Mr. Spicer said of the new order.\n\nStill, the renewed legal assault on Mr. Trump\u2019s policy could drag his administration into another messy court battle, even as Mr. Trump has tried to shift his attention away from the travel ban and toward a complex and politically fraught overhaul of the health care system.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Federal courts imposed a national freeze on its implementation, prompting Mr. Trump to attack the judiciary \u2014 and Judge Robart specifically \u2014 in an outburst on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAiming to head off another courtroom quagmire, Mr. Trump explicitly exempted several categories of travelers from the revised ban, including green card holders and people with other existing visas, and eliminated a provision that would have given special treatment to Christians.\n\nIt also removed Iraq from the list of countries covered and got rid of a permanent ban on refugee admissions from Syria. And rather than taking immediate effect, like the first presidential decree, the new order has an effective date of March 16.\n\nBut Mr. Ferguson said Washington State would argue in court that it should be up to a judge, not Mr. Trump, to decide if his new policy can go into effect, given that a court blocked the implementation of a similar executive order while litigation unfolds.\n\nAllowing Mr. Trump\u2019s new order to go into effect, Mr. Ferguson said, could lead to a \u201cgame of whack-a-mole,\u201d in which the president could answer any court\u2019s rebuke by making modest tweaks to his own policy and then hastening to implement it.\n\nAmong Democratic attorneys general, there is broad consensus that Mr. Trump\u2019s new order may be more difficult to fight in court. Mr. Ferguson repeatedly acknowledged that it would affect fewer people than the earlier order, while insisting that there was clear evidence that Mr. Trump intended the restrictions to function as a crackdown on Muslim travelers.\n\nMr. Ferguson said his office was in touch with a number of people and institutions that would be harmed by the new ban, including public universities and Washington residents with family overseas, in crafting its case against the executive order. Noah Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington State, said there had also been \u201cconversations with businesses in Washington\u201d about the order\u2019s impact on the state.\n\nMr. Purcell also suggested that the state would highlight comments from Trump administration officials describing the new travel ban as a modest revision, to show that it was intended to dispense with legal challenges without meaningfully changing policy.\n\nHe appeared to be alluding in part to a statement from Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, who said on television that the new ban would have the same \u201cbasic policy outcome\u201d as the previous version.\n\nHawaii\u2019s attorney general also cited Mr. Miller\u2019s statement in his complaint challenging the new ban.", "publish_date": "2017-03-09", "authors": "Alexander Burns", "type": "article"}
