{"title": "\u2018They Treated Us Like Criminals\u2019: U.S. Border Crossers Report Severe Reception", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/customs-airports-trump.html?mcubz=0", "text": "But not all the blame for soured airport experiences can be directed this president\u2019s way. Customs and Border Protection officers had the same discretion to screen travelers under the Obama administration, when Muslims and other travelers said they routinely endured intrusive and even discriminatory treatment. At this stage, the data available about customs officers\u2019 activities does not support the charge that many more travelers are facing extra scrutiny.\n\nStill, amid Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to harden American borders via wall, heightened vetting and a travel ban, the public is confronting a reality that went mostly unremarked in the past: In a country still struggling to define the balance between civil liberties and security nearly 16 years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, customs officers wield broad authority over the millions of people who knock on the United States\u2019 328 gates each year.\n\nIn the limbo between leaving another country and arriving in this one, the officers have wide latitude to examine travelers, their baggage and their electronic devices while deciding whether to let them in. The rights that individuals, even citizens, are entitled to once inside the United States do not always apply while they are trying to enter it.\n\n\u201cYou may think you are in the United States, but for legal purposes, you aren\u2019t until that inspector admits you,\u201d said Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the government agency that evolved into the Department of Homeland Security after Sept. 11.\n\nThe administration has not issued new directives about screening arriving passengers, and current and former government officials argue that many people are predisposed to see the worst in officers now that they work for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is something that has always occurred,\u201d said David Lapan, a Homeland Security spokesman. \u201cThe same things have happened under previous administrations.\u201d\n\nCivil liberties advocates and immigration lawyers, however, say they believe individual officers are fueling a disturbing escalation of enforcement, made plain in the aggressive tone as well as the frequency of travelers\u2019 encounters with them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is by no means an unprecedented thing,\u201d said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cBut it does seem at this point like the reports we\u2019re hearing are not just isolated reports, but they appear to be part of a trend. Either the word\u2019s gotten out unofficially or officially that this treatment can be tolerated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCustoms inspections are routine: On a typical day in 2016, for instance, the agency denied admittance to 752 people at ports of entry and flagged 877 people deemed possible national security risks.\n\nStill, for many travelers, officers\u2019 ability to examine their phones \u2014 and even request their pass codes \u2014 has made even ordinary stops into alarming and uncomfortably personal encounters. Even after travelers enter the country, the customs agency can keep their phones for weeks while investigators forensically peer into their contents.\n\nElectronic device searches were already on the rise under the Obama administration, with the number of travelers whose devices were searched more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. The monthly total of searches since Mr. Trump took office has remained roughly at the level that occurred during the last months of the Obama administration.\n\nMs. Alaoui, who drove to the border in early February, had intended to spend the day in Burlington shopping for toys for her 5-year-old son, who had just finished three months of chemotherapy.\n\nOn past trips, she said, she had spent about two minutes at the border before being waved through. This time, she and a cousin were questioned and held for four hours while their phones and car were searched.\n\nAfter telling her to write down the pass code to her phone, a customs officer asked where she had been born (Morocco), how long she had lived in Canada (more than 20 years) and if she was a practicing Muslim (yes).\n\nThe interrogation quickly veered further toward religious questions, Ms. Alaoui said. The officer asked about her mosque and its imam. He pulled up videos found on her phone, videos of Muslim prayers and Arabic jokes that had circulated among her friends and relatives on social media, and asked her to explain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen he asked what she thought of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI said he can do whatever he wants in his country. It\u2019s not my business. I just want to cross the border to go shopping. Why are you asking me this question?\u201d recalled Ms. Alaoui, who wears a hijab.\n\nAfter they were photographed and fingerprinted, another officer told the women that they would not be allowed into the country because of the videos found on their phones.\n\nMuslims have spoken for years of facing heavy scrutiny from customs officers, accusing the agency of racial profiling. So have people who may be mistaken for Muslims. Shah Rukh Khan, the Indian actor known as the \u201cKing of Bollywood,\u201d who is Muslim, has made headlines for being detained three times in seven years while traveling to the United States.\n\nThe most prominent such incident in recent months occurred when Muhammad Ali Jr., the famed boxer\u2019s son, was stopped by customs officers at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7. Mr. Ali, who had just arrived from a trip to Jamaica with his mother, said he had been led to a room where an officer asked how he had gotten his name and what his religion was.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

He had never had trouble entering the country before, he said.\n\nOfficers have \u201can enormous amount of discretion\u201d to question travelers, said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a head of civil rights and civil liberties at the Homeland Security Department under President Barack Obama. While Customs and Border Protection has an anti-discrimination rule, she said, the agency has not put significant limits on officers\u2019 ability to ask about religious beliefs.\n\nIn recent months, even non-Muslims have appeared to attract far more attention.\n\nAfter flying back to San Francisco from Belgium, where he had been showing some of his artwork, Aaron Gach, an American artist, was stopped and asked repeatedly to unlock his cellphone for an officer to search, he said. Mr. Gach, 43, said he had been asked a series of questions about his work, his travel arrangements and the art show. He was released only after complying with the request to unlock his phone.\n\nFor noncitizens, formerly routine trips have turned fraught as travelers report encountering customs officers who question whether they are taking American jobs or being paid improperly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe used to hear about these things once in a blue moon, and it would be the talk of the office,\u201d said Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer in Tennessee. \u201cNow people just basically roll their eyes because they\u2019ve heard it so often.\u201d\n\nThere was the Australian children\u2019s book author, Mem Fox, who was nearly denied entry on her way to give a speech in Milwaukee after being questioned about the $8,000 honorarium \u2014 standard for such speaking engagements \u2014 that she had accepted from the organizers.\n\nMs. Fox, 71, who had traveled to the United States uneventfully more than 100 times in the past, characterized her questioning as \u201csadistic from the first moment,\u201d though she was eventually allowed to continue on her way.\n\nThere was a 61-year-old ballet teacher from outside Toronto, Kennetha O\u2019Heany, who tried to drive across the border in March to observe a children\u2019s ballet class taught by another teacher in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nThough she had made a similar trip in 2014, the explanation did not satisfy the officer, whom she said had told her, \u201cIf there are Americans that can do this job, then you are an illegal foreign worker.\u201d\n\nHer three-hour detention at the Windsor-Detroit crossing culminated in a pat-down search by two female officers, who were so thorough that they even felt between her toes, Ms. O\u2019Heany said.\n\n\u201cI just kept thinking, \u2018But I\u2019m just a ballet teacher,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAnd there was Erik Hoeksema, whose group of about a dozen volunteers from a church in Ontario was stopped and turned back at the Buffalo crossing in March. They had been on their way to the Jersey Shore to help rebuild houses destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNo foreigners were allowed to do work for hire without visas, Mr. Hoeksema said he had been told. The fact that they were not going to be paid did not seem to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if we were mistreated, or we just made a mistake, or who knows?\u201d Mr. Hoeksema said, adding that he has heard of other volunteer groups being denied entry in the past. \u201cI just wish that you could just come to common sense and look at our group and consider that there still is a need for Sandy relief.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-01", "authors": "Vivian Yee", "type": "article"}
