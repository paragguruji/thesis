Mr. Gorka criticized Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, in a public show of disrespect that chafed Mr. Kelly\u2019s sense of order, according to one senior administration official.\n\nMr. Gorka also said that in fighting terrorism, white supremacists should not be a concern. He made the remarks shortly before the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., in which a man who was said to admire Adolf Hitler rammed his car into counterprotesters and left a woman dead.\n\nEfforts to reach Mr. Gorka on Friday night were not immediately successful.\n\nMr. Gorka, who described himself as a national security adviser to the president but who existed outside the National Security Council and had no clear duties, was a divisive figure while in the White House.

His hard-line views on Islam have prompted his critics to accuse him of Islamophobia.\n\nMr. Gorka, 46, has also been accused of having links to far-right groups in Europe. He is a former editor at Breitbart News, a right-wing website, and a friend of Stephen K. Bannon. Mr. Bannon, who was until last week Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, has since returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman.\n\nAn American citizen who was born in Britain to Hungarian parents, Mr. Gorka made a habit of assailing the news media for its coverage of Mr. Trump, insisting that reports of turmoil in the White House had \u201calmost no resemblance to reality.\u201d\n\nMr. Gorka earned a Ph.D. in political science from Corvinus University of Budapest and had made his living as a national security expert with a focus on Islamist extremism. He wrote a best-selling book, published last year, called \u201cDefeating Jihad: The Winnable War.\u201d\n\nMr. Gorka was not particularly well known to Washington policy makers before his appointment in January. But he has been connected with the Trump campaign since at least 2015. Federal election commission filings indicate that the Trump campaign paid $8,000 to Mr. Gorka for policy consulting that year.", "publish_date": "2017-08-25", "authors": "Maggie Haberman and Matt Stevens", "type": "article"}
