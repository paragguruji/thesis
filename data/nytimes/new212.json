Yet Dr. Parsi is still stuck in Iran, waiting for a delayed visa amid the confusion while his American employer fumes.\n\n\u201cWe need him desperately,\u201d said Dr. Richy Agajanian, the managing partner of the Oncology Institute of Hope and Innovation, which had just hired him. \u201cWe had an office completely constructed \u2014 we spent three months on it, and it was supposed to open Feb. 1. Now we can\u2019t open it. This is really sad and frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe 30-doctor practice does a lot of work in the Inland Empire, in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, Dr. Agajanian noted. \u201cIt\u2019s very sparse in doctors out there \u2014 many miles between oncologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe patients he would be seeing have to travel another 25 miles now. Our doctors are already overworked, and now they\u2019ll have to be on call more often.\u201d\n\nThe United States has a persistent doctor shortage, even though 31 new medical schools have opened since 2002 and many existing ones have increased class sizes, according to Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based medical recruiting firm.\n\nIt also noted that there are 22 percent more residencies available each year than there are American graduates to take them. Graduates of foreign medical schools now fill that gap; the largest number come from India, followed by Pakistan, China, the Philippines, Iran and Israel.\n\n(Iran is on Mr. Trump\u2019s exclusion list; Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country with a history of internal and external terror attacks, is not.)\n\nMany foreign graduates have J-1 visas, which give them about three years to complete their residencies. \u201cThey must pass licensing exams and they must do a residency to practice here, even if they\u2019re superstars where they come from,\u201d said Phillip Miller, a Merritt Hawkins spokesman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForeign-born graduates have often worked at world-class institutions and have published academic papers, so they have higher average scores than American graduates on the medical knowledge portions of the licensing examinations, according to Merritt Hawkins research \u2014 though most initially score lower on the clinical skills portions, which include English and communication skills.\n\n\u201cI had to work my butt off to get here,\u201d said Dr. Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year resident at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThey only take the top graduates from schools in countries like mine.\u201d\n\nSuch foreign-born graduates must return home when their visas expire, but they can get extensions if they agree to work in an area that the Department of Health and Human Services considers \u201cmedically underserved,\u201d which is roughly defined as having less than one primary care doctor for every 3,000 people.\n\nThose who practice in an underserved area for several years can apply for green cards. \u201cAfter that, they can practice anywhere, but at least you\u2019ve had three or four years of a physician in your town, and that\u2019s pretty significant,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side has five times the number of doctors it needs to be adequately served under federal guidelines, parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn have acute doctor shortages.\n\nMore than 150,000 residents of Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant section, for example, are rated as medically underserved under federal guidelines. One of the doctors stranded overseas last week, according to Pro Publica, was Dr. Kamal Fadlalla, an internal medicine specialist from Sudan who is a second-year resident at Interfaith Medical Center, which serves Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany foreign-born doctors, experts said, go into family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, general surgery and other front-line specialties where they see thousands of patients a year, including many on Medicare and Medicaid, rather than pursuing lucrative urban specialties like plastic surgery.\n\nAs an oncologist, Dr. Parsi was an exception. He moved to the United States in 2007 for postdoctoral work in molecular biology. Then, after passing his medical exam, he completed his residency at the University of Cincinnati and a fellowship in hematology and oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nBecause he had to leave the country to get his new visa stamped into his passport, he had flown to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. He cleared a security vetting there, he said, but had to wait a few days for the visa, so he flew to Tehran to see his father.\n\nBut the new court ruling affects only those who had current visa stamps in their passport, so even though he is being issued a new visa, he still cannot return to the United States, he said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cEveryone, including me, would like to keep the bad people out,\u201d said Dr. Naeem Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is finishing his medical residency in Minneapolis and plans to begin a cardiology fellowship in Chicago in the fall. \u201cBut this is not the best way to do it. If I have to leave, it affects my patients.\u201d\n\nDr. El Rafei said that the ban, which means he cannot go home to see his family, had depressed him.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was back in Syria again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel hunted there, as if you did something wrong, even if you didn\u2019t. Now I feel the same way here.\u201d\n\nHe sees patients one day a week at the V.A. Hospital in Minneapolis, where he is sometimes asked where he is from.\n\n\u201cOne of my patients, he was a veteran in his 60s, said to me, \u2018Why do you people hate us?\u2019 \u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI told him about Syria. I said: \u2018We don\u2019t hate you. The bad people you see on TV are the same people who make us suffer, too.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI love this country,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a time in our residency when we can work in Africa or someplace. I want to work in a small American town, to show people that we\u2019re not all bad. The U.S. gives us a lot, so we want to give back what we can.\u201d", "authors": ["Donald G.
