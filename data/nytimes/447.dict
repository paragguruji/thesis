Trump staked his primary campaign on an unwavering, hard-line position on immigration, complete with mass deportations, a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and a border wall paid for by Mexico. Recently he said he was open to \u201csoftening\u201d on his positions. Here\u2019s a look at how the Republican candidate\u2019s positions on immigration have changed, or remained the same, throughout the campaign, including Wednesday\u2019s big policy speech.\n\nThe Border Wall Then There must be a wall across the southern border. ... Mexico must pay for the wall. Trump releases immigration plan, Aug. 16, 2015 Now We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for it. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 Mr. Trump has promised -- steadfastly and repeatedly -- to build a wall along the southern border, and has said that Mexico would pay for its construction through increased border-crossing fees and NAFTA tarriffs. Some of his surrogates, like Rick Perry and Rudolph W. Giuliani, have recently referred to a \"digital wall\" -- meaning technology would be used to track and prevent and prevent illegal immigration -- but Mr. Trump has been adamant about the physical boundary since announcing his plan.\n\nDeportation of 11 Million Undocumented Immigrants Then We got to move 'em out, we're going to move 'em back in if they're really good people. CNN interview, July 30, 2015 Now We are going to deport many people, many, many people. ...We're going to do that vigorously, we're going to go with the laws that are existing, but we're going to have a very strong border and we're not going to have people pouring back in. CNN interview with Anderson Cooper, Aug. 25, 2016 For many hard-line conservatives, anything short of deporting the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants in the country amounts to a form of \"amnesty.\" Mr. Trump initially appealed to them through his promise to have them all \"gone,\" but he seemed to walk back this position recently when he said he was open to \"softening\" on some of his immigration policies. In his speech, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would forcibly deport all undocumented immigrants already here, but laid out numerous proposals that would lead to expedited deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nDeportation Force Then You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\", Nov. 11, 2015 Now Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America, who have evaded justice. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 Removing undocumented immigrants from the United States was a cornerstone of Mr. Trump's initial appeal to conservatives in the Republican Party, and also one of his most ambitious and potentially expensive policies. The approach also initially put him at odds with other Republicans who saw unconditional deportation as being unrealistic and lacking compassion. In his immigration speech, he spoke of creating a \u201cdeportation task force\u201d to focus on the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes.\n\nDeportation of Criminals Then All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally. Trump releases immigration plan, Aug. 16, 2015 Now Their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They\u2019re going to be gone. It will be over. They\u2019re going out fast. Moving forward, we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 Undocumented immigrants who commit crimes have been the focus of Mr. Trump's deportation plans. He has featured families of victims in campaign ads and invited them to speak at his rallies. He has not wavered on this position.\n\nPath to Legal Status Then I would get people out and I would have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal. CNN interview, July 30, 2015 Now For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 Mr. Trump was not a supporter of legalization initially. He forcefully criticized Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primary for his work on bipartisan immigration legislation that included a path to legal status, saying Mr. Rubio was for \"amnesty\" and denounced Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for a similar position. But reports that Mr. Trump was open to legalization initiated a week of mixed messages from the candidate. Mr. Trump offered a direct rebuttal in his speech, saying that there will be no path for legal status for anyone who entered the country illegally.\n\nVisa Tracking Then Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties. ... Completion of a visa tracking system \u2013 required by law but blocked by lobbyists \u2013 will be necessary as well. Trump immigration plan, Aug. 16, 2015 Now We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need. \u2026 Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my administration. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 In his initial immigration plan, Mr. Trump called for \"enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa,\" but did not explicitly call for such visitors to be removed. This is one of the few shifts in his immigration policy in which he has actually developed a more aggressive approach than his position during the primaries. It's also similar to a policy from the bipartisan Senate legislation that called for improvements to the visa tracking system, but did not include a provision for their \"quick removal.\"\n\nNationwide E-Verify Then Nationwide E-verify. This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans. Trump immigration plan, Aug. 16, 2015 Now We will ensure that E-verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. Immigration speech, Aug. 31, 2016 E-Verify has been a cornerstone of Republican immigration platforms since 2013, when it was included in the bipartisan Gang of Eight immigration reform bill that ultimately failed in the Senate. But it was also frequently mentioned by his chief Republican rivals, like Jeb Bush, which could explain why Mr. Trump avoided much discussion on the topic in the primaries.", "publish_date": "2016-08-31", "authors": "Nick Corasaniti", "type": "article"}
