Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu ruled that the administration\u2019s approach had disregarded the language and logic of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, fairness and the conventional understanding of who counts as a close family member.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the ruling as undermining national security, creating confusion and violating respect for separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThe district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement.\n\nLater that day, the administration filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to clarify its decision. It said the justices should act immediately, without waiting for a ruling from the appeals court.\n\nThe administration said it was entitled to exclude refugees whom resettlement agencies had planned to help move to the United States. Judge Watson disagreed, writing that the Supreme Court had meant to allow such people to enter the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAn assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency, in fact, meets each of the Supreme Court\u2019s touchstones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is formal, it is a documented contract, it is binding, it triggers responsibilities and obligations, including compensation, it is issued specific to an individual refugee only when that refugee has been approved for entry by the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nIn its Supreme Court brief, the Justice Department said that Judge Watson\u2019s ruling \u201cwould render the refugee portion of this court\u2019s decision effectively meaningless.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Hawaii who are challenging the travel ban disputed that assertion. They said about 24,000 refugees had a formal assurance of help from a settlement agency, while another 175,000 in the pipeline did not.\n\n\u201cMany of those refugees \u2014 as well as countless visa applicants from the targeted nations \u2014 will be unable to demonstrate any other form of bona fide relationship with an American party, meaning that they will be absolutely barred from entering the country in the next several months,\u201d the Hawaii lawyers wrote.\n\nThey also said Judge Watson\u2019s order did nothing to stop the administration from enforcing its travel ban against an estimated 85 percent of refugees, or to exclude extended family members \u201cwho indisputably lack close relationships with American individuals and entities.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the administration\u2019s request for clarity on the scope of last month\u2019s decision. The justices said that the appeal in the case should follow the ordinary course and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, should first address the question.\n\nIn temporarily blocking the part of Judge Watson\u2019s order concerning refugees, the Supreme Court indicated that the government\u2019s arguments had weight. In declining to disturb the part of the order that allowed relatives to enter, the Supreme Court suggested that the administration might have overreached.\n\nChallenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel bans have been ricocheting around the federal courts for almost as long as he has been president.\n\nHis first ban, issued in January, caused chaos at the nation\u2019s airports until it was blocked by the courts. Rather than appealing to the Supreme Court, the administration issued a revised executive order in March. But that order, too, was blocked by federal appeals courts, which ruled that it violated the Constitution by discriminating based on religion and that it exceeded Mr. Trump\u2019s authority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on October 10.\n\nIn a partial dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last month, Justice Thomas said the line the court had drawn, allowing those with \u201cbona fide relationships\u201d to enter the country, was unworkable. He predicted \u2014 accurately \u2014 that the court\u2019s compromise would \u201cinvite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \u2018bona fide relationship.\u2019\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["ruling", "restrictions", "courts", "trump", "allowed", "ban", "supreme", "refugee", "judge", "court", "order", "rejected", "refugees", "administration", "decision", "grandparents"], "summary": "Judge Watson disagreed, writing that the Supreme Court had meant to allow such people to enter the country.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cAn assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency, in fact, meets each of the Supreme Court\u2019s touchstones,\u201d he wrote.\nIn temporarily blocking the part of Judge Watson\u2019s order concerning refugees, the Supreme Court indicated that the government\u2019s arguments had weight.\nIn declining to disturb the part of the order that allowed relatives to enter, the Supreme Court suggested that the administration might have overreached.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on October 10."}
