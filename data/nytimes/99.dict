On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan, where she is a citizen, after a research trip for her anthropology Ph.D. at Stanford University.\n\nMs. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers. \u201cI have to do this,\u201d one told her. For five hours they asked about her travels, her academic research and her views on Sudanese politics, which they admitted to knowing little about.\n\nAt one point, she said, they aggressively patted her down and handcuffed her. They removed the restraints when she began to cry, but the detainees brought in for questioning after her arrived in handcuffs, she said.\n\n\u201cFor the brief moment I was handcuffed, I couldn\u2019t control myself and I just started crying,\u201d Ms. Omer said. \u201cIt was humiliating. I thought I was going to be returned to Sudan.\u201d\n\nAfter Ms. Omer was released she said she felt like one of the lucky ones.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people being treated much worse or are being sent back,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they get sent back to Iraq or Syria it is a life-or-death situation.\u201d\n\nHazhir Rahmandad\u2019s parents\n\nHazhir Rahmandad, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, said his parents who hold green cards and split their time between the United States and Iran, were due back in Massachusetts on Tuesday to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Rahmandad\u2019s twin children. Now they will not travel.\n\nProfessor Rahmandad set up a Google form for people from countries affected by the immigration order to report and share their experiences attempting to travel to the U.S. \u201cI was so concerned,\u201d he said. By Saturday evening, his spreadsheet had over 200 entries, most of them concerning people from Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAli Abdi, Iran\n\nMr. Abdi, 30, a Ph.D. student in anthropology at Yale with permanent residency in the United States, said he left the United States on Jan. 22 for Afghanistan, where he planned to do field research for much of the next year. He had participated in the women\u2019s march in Washington the day before. Now, he said he was in legal limbo as he awaited a visa from the consulate of Afghanistan, unable to return to the United States even with a green card and fearful of returning to Iran because of his activism about human rights issues there.\n\nSpeaking by phone from Dubai, Mr. Abdi said his current visa limits his stay in the United Arab Emirates to about a month. The possibility that green card holders and refugees could be barred from the United States did not occur to him when he left, he said.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe it really, that it was going to be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we were taking the Trump administration less seriously than it is.\u201d\n\nNada, Iraq\n\nNada, a Yazidi woman from Iraq, was on her way to be reunited with her husband, Khalas, who lives in Washington. The two of them, their last names not released, were granted special immigrant visas to the United States as part of a program created to help thousands of Iraqis with ties to the United States, according to The New Yorker. Khalas, a former interpreter for the United States Army, was granted his visa in April. Nada\u2019s visa was approved about a week ago, and her passport on Thursday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Johnson, the founder and executive director of the List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies. \u201cThe flight crew sent her back,\u201d Khalas texted Mr. Johnson, \u201csaying they got orders that no Iraqis with American visas should be boarded.\u201d\n\nSarah Assali\u2019s family, Syria\n\nMs. Assali, 25, a third-year medical student from Allentown, Pa., said six of her Syrian relatives had arrived in Philadelphia on a flight from Doha, Qatar, on Saturday morning, only to be detained and put on a flight back less than three hours later. The group had obtained family-based immigrant visas.\n\nMs. Assali said in a telephone interview that her six relatives \u2014 two uncles, two aunts and two teenage cousins, whom she did not name out of fear of endangering them or their case \u2014 are Christians who live in Damascus. Her father was on his way to pick up the relatives from the airport when he got a call from a customs official, she said, who said his family would not be leaving the airport. \u201cThey told him they\u2019re not coming out, and to just go back.\u201d Ms. Assali said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s confidential and he can\u2019t tell them why. They said it was an issue with their paperwork.\u201d\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh, Iraq\n\nMr. Darweesh, a husband and father of three who worked for the United States military in Iraq for about a decade, was detained after arriving at Kennedy Airport on Friday night. He was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20. When he filed for it, he said he had been directly targeted because of his work for the United States as an interpreter, engineer and contractor.\n\nMr. Darweesh was released on Saturday after lawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court seeking freedom for him, as well as for another Iraqi detained at the airport.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpeaking to reporters and some protesters who gathered outside Kennedy Airport, Mr. Darweesh called the United States the greatest nation in the world. He said he was thankful for the people who had worked on his behalf. \u201cThis is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here.\u201d\n\nHamaseh Tayari, United Kingdom\n\nMs. Tayari, a resident of the United Kingdom who holds an Iranian passport, was unable to get back to Glasgow, where she works as a veterinarian, from Costa Rica, where she was vacationing, because her flight traveled through New York, according to The Guardian. Ms. Tayari grew up in Italy and told the newspaper that she had never experienced anything like it. She said it might cost her a month\u2019s salary to book a new flight home.\n\n\u201cI am destroyed,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on.\u201d\n\nUnnamed family of six, Syria\n\nThe family members have been living in a refugee camp in Turkey, and were scheduled to fly to the United States on Monday, according to US Together, a refugee resettlement agency quoted in The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. The agency had found an apartment for them to rent with another family of Syrian refugees in Cleveland.\n\nThose plans have been canceled after Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be really perfect,\u201d Danielle Drake, a community relations manager for US Together, told the newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how the family feels right now.\u201d\n\nSeyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, Iran\n\nMr. Saravi, a young scientist in Iran, had been scheduled to travel to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship at Harvard to study cardiovascular medicine, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise his research. Then the visas for Mr. Saravi and his wife were suspended, Professor Michel said.\n\n\u201cThis outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,\u201d Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. \u201cThis country and this city have a long history of providing research training to the best young scientists in the world, many of whom have stayed in the U.S.A. and made tremendous contributions in biomedicine and other disciplines.\u201d\n\nHaider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, Iraq\n\nMr. Alshawi, who worked for a United States contractor in Iraq, was detained after he landed at Kennedy Airport on Friday. He had flown from Stockholm to New York, en route to Texas to see his wife and son.\n\n\u201cHe gave his package and his passport to an airport officer, and they didn\u2019t talk to him, they just put him in a room,\u201d his wife, who asked to be referred to only by her first initial, D, told The New York Times. \u201cHe told me that they forced him to get back to Iraq. He asked for his lawyer and to apply for an asylum case. And they told him: \u2018You can\u2019t do that. You need to go back to your country.\u2019\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "authors": "Eli Rosenberg and Liam Stack", "type": "article"}
