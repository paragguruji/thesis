Senators to Oppose DeVos as Education Secretary, Imperiling Her Confirmation", "text": "\u201cI will not, I cannot vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next secretary of education,\u201d Ms. Collins said.\n\nBoth senators, who voted to advance her selection out of committee, said they had serious reservations about her lack of familiarity with public schools. \u201cI think that Mrs. DeVos has much to learn about our nation\u2019s public schools,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said.\n\nSenator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has said he believes every Democrat will vote against Ms. DeVos. If that is the case, the defections by Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski would bring the number of votes against her to 50, setting up a tie in the Senate that Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, might need to come in to settle.\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he had no worries.\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump greets fallen commando in unscheduled trip\n\nPresident Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Wednesday to honor the remains of a Navy commando killed in a raid on Al Qaeda forces in Yemen on Sunday, the first combat casualty of his presidency.\n\nMr. Trump left the White House by helicopter shortly after 3 p.m., accompanied by his daughter Ivanka. The White House did not announce his destination until shortly before he arrived, an unusual break with protocol, though former President Barack Obama paid multiple, unannounced visits to the Dover Air Base to receive the caskets of fallen soldiers.\n\nAt the air base, Mr. Trump attend a private ceremony with the family of the commando, Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, who was a member of Navy Seal Team 6.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe raid was the first military operation ordered by Mr. Trump, and the press secretary, Sean Spicer, spoke emotionally about the sacrifice made by Chief Petty Officer Owens. With the exception of visits to war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, presidents rarely, if ever, travel without notifying the news media in advance.\n\nMr. Trump, a senior White House official said, did not announce the trip out of respect for the privacy of the Owens family and because he did not want to turn it into a media spectacle.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama traveled to Dover without notifying the media in 2011, it prompted a surge of questions from the White House press corps. The White House said it had made the decision based on security concerns.\n\nTrump files for re-election \u2014 to hold on to his campaign cash\n\nOn the day of his inauguration, President Trump filed paperwork to declare his candidacy in the 2020 election, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a show of supreme confidence \u2014 more like a grasp for cash.\n\nFinancial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission show that a lucrative December made the move an accounting necessity. The Trump campaign ended the year with $7.6 million in the bank and no debt, so any funds raised over $5,000 by the campaign in 2017 would have to be returned unless Mr. Trump registered as a candidate for 2020. He obviously was not prepared to offer refunds.\n\nAnd the money has kept flowing. The campaign brought in more than $4 million in expense refunds, mostly from members of the media and the Secret Service for the seats they used on his campaign planes. This arrangement is typical \u2014 campaigns are required to charge the Secret Service and the press a fair rate. What\u2019s unusual is that most of the campaign\u2019s air travel expenses, nearly $9 million, were paid to companies owned by Trump.\n\nThere is one expenditure that has not slowed: Making America wear red hats again. The Trump campaign, along with two fundraising committees that raise money jointly with the Republican Party, brought in $6.5 million in contributions in the last month of 2016. More than a third of that was spent on on hats, mugs, stickers and other collateral.\n\nWall Street financier tied to Chinese conglomerate won\u2019t get White House job for now\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, an investment firm founder and Republican donor, won\u2019t be assuming the role of director of the White House office of public liaison, as previously announced, a senior administration official said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Scaramucci on Wednesday was told by Reince Priebus, the chief of staff to President Trump, and by the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, that someone else would have to be given the job. However, the official said, the two men plan to find another role for Mr. Scaramucci in the West Wing down the road.\n\nAt issue is Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s sale of his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a division of HNA Group, a politically connected Chinese conglomerate that will become the investment firm\u2019s majority owner. The sale has not been completed, and West Wing officials said that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office predicted it would take up to 90 days for Mr. Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts.\n\nThe White House is currently operating without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, the formal name for the office which Mr. Scaramucci would have led, at a moment when protests are sweeping the country over the president\u2019s ban on travel for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMr. Scaramucci could get an ambassadorship, but that would require Senate confirmation, which is another lengthy process.\n\nMr. Scaramucci had been expected to be sworn in on Jan. 22 with other White House personnel, but it was delayed amid questions related to the business transaction.\n\nThis is not the first time that a West Wing aide has been announced for a role that they ultimately didn\u2019t fill. Mr. Trump has no communications director and lost a National Security Council senior staff member after questions about whether she\u2019d plagiarized portions of her book.\n\nTrump: That Frederick Douglass \u201chas done an amazing job.\u201d\n\nYes, that Frederick Douglass, former slave, abolitionist and statesman who died in 1895.\n\nMeeting with African-American supporters at the White House on Wednesday, the president let it be known that Mr. Douglass, an important figure in American history, had come to his attention.\n\n\u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHarriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. A big impact.\u201d\n\nYes, he said that.\n\nProtest Nation plans to make noise at Mar-a-Lago\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hope for relative peace and calm this weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., may be disrupted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmboldened by demonstrations across the country, and the White House\u2019s decision to skip a trip to Milwaukee rather than face angry opponents, protesters are planning a march outside the club as it plays host to the annual American Red Cross gala.\n\nThe gala has been held at the club in previous years, and Mr. Trump has attended. It is unclear whether he will attend this year.\n\nThe protests will paint an untimely tableau for a president whose last five days have been spent facing fallout from his executive order temporarily banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTheir action may have been encouraged by the White House itself. The decision to cancel President Trump\u2019s trip to Milwaukee for a visit to a Harley-Davidson factory on Thursday was sure to have repercussions for the already energized activists opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nHarley-Davidson was worried about the protests and the possible harm to its popularity, just as Peyton Manning was last week when he dashed out the back door of a Republican retreat in Philadelphia rather than risk the cameras.\n\nAnd the next big march on Washington \u2014 this one dubbed the March for Science \u2014 now has a date: April 22, Earth Day.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is already mocking the decision.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a real tough guy when it comes to locking up a scared 5-year-old boy trying to find his mother,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, Democratic National Committee senior adviser. \u201cBut as soon as he has to face the American people to defend his illegal anti-Muslim ban, he chickens out. What a profile in courage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo say \u2018ban\u2019 or not to say \u2018ban,\u2019 that is the question\n\nFirst, President Trump called his hard stop on refugees and visas to seven Muslim nations a ban.\n\nThen his press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood at the White House podium on Tuesday and said it was not a ban, a position he held to, even after reporters quoted his boss.\n\nNow Mr. Trump has asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d\n\nGlad that\u2019s settled.\n\nTrump vs. Prince Charles: Knickers are in a twist\n\nPlans for President Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain are all coming a cropper.\n\nWhen British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Mr. Trump last week to pay a state visit to Britain, a call on Queen Elizabeth II was part of the invitation. But royal visits tend to involve more than just the queen, and the Prince of Wales has made clear that he intends to give Mr. Trump a piece of his mind about the urgent need to address climate change.\n\nAmerican officials have made clear that Mr. Trump has no intention of being lectured by Prince Charles and instead, he wants to be greeted by Prince Charles\u2019s much cuter children, including Prince William, his attractive wife, Kate Middleton, and their young children.\n\nOf course, this 2012 post on Twitter might make that a tad awkward as well:\n\nBut Prince Charles, who has been denied a kingship most of his life because of his mother\u2019s decision to hang onto the crown into her 90s, has made clear that he does not intend to be passed over by Mr. Trump.\n\nThe royal snag is one of several that have cropped up over Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. British Prime Minister Theresa May thought her own visit to the White House had gone swimmingly, only to discover that shortly after she left, Mr. Trump had signed an executive order barring refugees and the entry of anyone from seven countries, which caused a firestorm in Britain.\n\nMs. May was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat. Protesters gathered outside 10 Downing Street on Monday night, and more than 1.5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMrs. May has insisted that her invitation remain in force, but the initial bloom of her visit has decidedly faded. And now Prince Charles has promised to give it a royal tarnish.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. to lead higher education task force\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to regulate the once flourishing for-profit university system did not get a lot of attention, but they had big consequences.\n\nCritics of the universities saw fake diploma mills that recruited students with advertising on buses, on subways and even in homeless shelters, and then helped them get guaranteed student loans from the federal government. Money in hand, the for-profits often left the students to their own devices. If they dropped out, or got degrees that proved worthless in the work world, so be it: The taxpayer would pay off the loans if the students couldn\u2019t.\n\nThe Obama-era regulations tightened up recruiting rules and tied loans to the schools\u2019 records of getting their students the jobs they were promised. Many for-profit universities went under.\n\nNow, President Trump \u2014 who just settled a fraud suit against his Trump University \u2014 has asked Liberty University\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., a stern critic of accreditation rules, to head a White House task force on higher education, assigned to focus on \u201coverregulation and micromanagement,\u201d a Liberty spokesman told NBC News.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to pare it back and give colleges and their accrediting agencies more leeway in governing their affairs,\u201d Mr. Falwell, an evangelical Christian, told The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nThe pendulum could be swinging back fast.\n\nJoe Biden forms his foundation\n\nWhether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will actually run for president in 2020 at age 78 is still uncertain, but some of his plans for life after 44 years of public service became a bit more clear on Tuesday after he announced the formation of the Biden Foundation.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, Mr. Biden used one of his father\u2019s favorite aphorisms to mark the occasion.\n\n\u201cMy dad used to have an expression, \u2018It\u2019s a lucky person who gets up in the morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they\u2019re about to do and thinks it still matters,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to this new chapter.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
