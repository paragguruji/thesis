If you joined last week, welcome back. If not, there\u2019s still time to participate.\n\nA key to staying motivated is to create habits that take away the opportunity to slip up. This is a concept my colleague Charles Duhigg has explored: \u201cAt the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits \u2014 such as exercise habits \u2014 you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards.\u201d\n\nThis article tells you how to do that. I can attest to the power of this approach, and we want you to try it out yourself. Email us with one habit that would support your resolution, and how you\u2019re going to create it. Near the end of the month, we\u2019ll check back in with some of these and see how you did. \u2014 Tim Herrera, Smarter Living editor\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Recipe of the day: For a step away from weeknight pasta, try your hand at ricotta gnocchi.\n\nNoteworthy\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 Hideo Yokoyama, a former police reporter, is one of Japan\u2019s most popular crime novelists. \u201cSix Four,\u201d his first book to be translated into English, and a best-seller in Britain, goes on sale in the U.S. on Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 And remember Gondwana?

A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries.\n\nOriginally conceived as a family-friendly educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a 16-year gap (1989-2005), has been broadcast ever since.\n\nThe show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record).\n\nThe Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health.\n\nMr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor \u2014 and the 12th white man \u2014 to fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his \u2014 or her \u2014 debut.\n\nChris Stanford contributed reporting.\n\n_____\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.\n\nWhat would you like to see here?
