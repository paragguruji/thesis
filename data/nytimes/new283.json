Bids for the 2026 tournament must be submitted by December 2018, before the start of a 13-month evaluation phase. FIFA will choose the host at a congress in May 2020.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s proposed 90-day ban applied only to seven countries, but it caught the eye of world soccer officials because at least three of those countries have national teams that could be affected if it becomes more than a temporary policy. One of them, Iran, has played in the World Cup three times since 1998, and two others \u2014 Iraq and Syria \u2014 have joined Iran in the later rounds of Asian qualifying for next year\u2019s tournament in Russia.\n\nU.S. Soccer declined to comment on Mr. Ceferin\u2019s remarks on Sunday. Though it has not publicly confirmed its intention to bid for the tournament, the federation has expressed confidence that it would receive all the governmental guarantees needed to meet FIFA\u2019s criteria for admitting visiting players and fans, and that no ban \u2014 temporary or otherwise \u2014 would be in place for the tournament. FIFA\u2019s rules do not dictate that any potential hosts have entirely open borders.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be the first to comprise 48 teams after FIFA unanimously agreed last month to expand the competition from its current 32-team format. A final decision on how many spots each confederation will be given is expected when FIFA meets on March 30, but Mr. Ceferin insisted that Europe\u2019s conditions are clear: UEFA will demand 16 places, an increase of three teams, and request a guarantee that only one European team will be placed in each three-team group.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

The others are still discussing. That will happen, or we will make things quite complicated.\n\n\u201cTwo or three of our member nations suggested to me that we ask for 20 or 24 teams, and if we have to settle for 16, then O.K., but I do not want to push it. I said that we should be realistic. To say that we want half the teams at the World Cup would look arrogant to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Ceferin also acknowledged that more stringent immigration policies could harm Britain\u2019s chances of hosting major finals once that country exits the European Union. The Champions League final will have been held in Britain three times in the last nine years \u2014 twice at Wembley Stadium in London and this June at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales \u2014 and the semifinals and final of the 2020 European Championship are set for London.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf \u2018Brexit\u2019 happens, everything changes,\u201d Mr. Ceferin said. \u201cBut football was played before, and it will be played in the future. Now, with free movement in the European Union, it is much better.\u201d\n\nThough Mr. Ceferin, a former president of Slovenia\u2019s soccer federation, insisted that UEFA\u2019s commitment to staging the final matches of Euro 2020 in England remained \u201cfirm,\u201d he said the organization might have to discount Britain as a potential venue for showpiece games if \u201cBrexit\u201d made it harder for players and fans to enter the country.\n\nAs proof of the extra complications that might arise after England\u2019s exit, he cited the example of Serge Aurier, the Paris St.-Germain defender who was denied entry by British authorities for a Champions League game against Arsenal last year because of a conviction for assault that was under appeal.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed when Aurier, from P.S.G., was not allowed to enter England,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will worsen when \u2018Brexit\u2019 happens, especially if the reasons were as formal. We could have a serious problem.\u201d\n\nMr. Ceferin said he had no problem if the authorities wanted to withhold visas from \u201ca severe criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we see that players cannot enter because they have any sort of procedure ongoing, then we will simply think if we should play our European matches there,\u201d he said. \u201cNeymar and Lionel Messi both have procedures going on. This year, the Champions League final is in Cardiff. Imagine if they did not let them in. That is a big thing for us, if players from England can travel anywhere but players from other teams cannot travel to England. With free movement in Europe, it is much better.\n\n\u201cEven in 2020, if \u2018Brexit\u2019 has happened, then it can be a big problem for fans. That stays firm, and we will speak to the British government, and I am sure the English Football Association will help us.\u201d", "authors": ["Rory Smith"], "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["final", "travel", "restrictions", "world", "tournament", "players", "teams", "soccer", "cup", "2026", "bid", "ceferin", "times", "damage", "uefa", "president", "mr", "european"], "summary": "Mr. Ceferin\u2019s warning is significant; in addition to his position leading European soccer, he is a vice president of FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body and the organizer of the World Cup.\nBids for the 2026 tournament must be submitted by December 2018, before the start of a 13-month evaluation phase.\nThe 2026 World Cup will be the first to comprise 48 teams after FIFA unanimously agreed last month to expand the competition from its current 32-team format.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cIf \u2018Brexit\u2019 happens, everything changes,\u201d Mr. Ceferin said.\nThat is a big thing for us, if players from England can travel anywhere but players from other teams cannot travel to England."}
