Now There\u2019s the Court Test.", "text": "No specific religion is mentioned in the executive order, which was issued on Jan. 27, but the appeals court said it must examine evidence that the order was meant to carry out a Muslim ban.\n\nThat would include an interview Mr. Giuliani gave the day after it was issued. Speaking to Fox News, he cast himself as the architect.\n\nAsked if the new order had anything to do with religion, Mr. Giuliani held forth on how it had been devised and what he said had been his role in carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on Fox. \u201cSo when he first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up and said, \u2018Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy focusing the order not on religion but on areas of the world that created danger for the United States, Mr. Giuliani said, the ban is \u201cperfectly sensible, perfectly legal.\u201d\n\nNow federal courts are considering if the order is, in fact, \u201cperfectly legal.\u201d\n\nCongress and the Constitution give a president broad control over the country\u2019s borders. One explicit limit is that a president may not refuse immigrants visas because of their race, sex, nationality, place of birth or residence.\n\nAugust Flentje, a lawyer from the Department of Justice, argued this week before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that judges cannot try to find out if a president disguised some of the reasons for an executive order. The \u201cbest evidence\u201d of the president\u2019s intent is the language of the order, he said, adding: \u201cThat is the end of the inquiry.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Until his interview, Mr. Giuliani \u2014 the former mayor of New York, former candidate for the United States Senate and former candidate for president \u2014 had largely fallen into eclipse following a spectacular run of appearances on behalf of Mr. Trump during the campaign.\n\nIn October, Mr. Giuliani boasted of having inside information from F.B.I. agents and promised a late-game surprise that would damage the campaign of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic opponent of Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of things up our sleeve that should turn this thing around,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, 11 days before the election, the F.B.I. director announced that the agency was looking into emails that had been found on a laptop used by the estranged husband of an aide to Mrs. Clinton. Although the F.B.I. eventually said nothing in the emails warranted prosecution, the political damage had been done to the Clinton campaign.\n\nDuring arguments this week, the lawyer from the Department of Justice seemed to scoff at citations from news reports of remarks by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president\u2019s national security determination based on some newspaper articles,\u201d Mr. Flentje said.\n\nJudge Richard R. Clifton, a member of the appeals panel who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, wanted clarification.\n\n\u201cDo you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then-candidate Trump and to his political advisers, and most recently Mr. Giuliani \u2014 do you deny that those statements were made?\u201d Judge Clifton asked.\n\nMr. Flentje suggested that campaign statements were not the right place to look for the president\u2019s intent.\n\nJudge Clifton said the words mattered: \u201cEither those kinds of statements were made, or they\u2019re not.\u201d", "authors": ["Jim Dwyer", "About New York"], "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["theres", "came", "input", "test", "trump", "immigration", "court", "united", "states", "religion", "statements", "order", "president", "york", "mr", "giuliani", "giulianis"], "summary": "That would include an interview Mr. Giuliani gave the day after it was issued.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on Fox.\nIn October, Mr. Giuliani boasted of having inside information from F.B.I.\nagents and promised a late-game surprise that would damage the campaign of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic opponent of Mr. Trump.\nDuring arguments this week, the lawyer from the Department of Justice seemed to scoff at citations from news reports of remarks by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani."}
