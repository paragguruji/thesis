And none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p.m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be live-streamed on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual.\n\nThe case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nAt issue is the earlier ruling, by Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, that blocked the key parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. Judge Robart\u2019s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred from entry to come to the United States, and it inspired a harsh attack from Mr. Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security.\n\nVideo\n\nOn Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Judge Robart\u2019s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs, the States of Washington and Minnesota.

Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the administration\u2019s brief said, would violate the separation of powers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe states responded that \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201d\n\nThey added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order.\n\nQuestions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions.\n\nSeveral former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration making a second kind of argument. \u201cWe view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d it said. \u201cIn our professional opinion, this order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds.\u201d\n\nThe officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser; and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have \u201ca devastating humanitarian impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd apart from all of these concerns,\u201d the former officials said, \u201cthe order offends our nation\u2019s laws and values.\u201d\n\nThe third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump\u2019s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses.\n\nAlmost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it \u201charms the competitiveness of U.S. companies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe \u201cinstability and uncertainty\u201d created by the order, the brief said, \u201cwill make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world\u2019s best talent \u2014 and impede them from competing in the global marketplace.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "administration", "trump", "national", "ban", "appeals", "brief", "judge", "court", "states", "trumps", "reinstate", "urges", "justice", "order", "president", "department", "mr"], "summary": "Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats \u201cfrom radical Islamic terrorism is very real.\u201d\u201cCourts must act fast!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.\nTrial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court.\nAt issue is the earlier ruling, by Judge James L.
