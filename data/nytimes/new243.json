Some Iranians Are Saying No", "text": "In Washington, a coalition of Iranian-American groups and Iranian individuals was among the latest to take legal action against the Trump administration, announcing on Thursday that it had filed a lawsuit in federal court to block the president\u2019s order as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe executive order shunts aside the intricate matrix of statutes and regulations that govern the U.S. immigration system, and casts many thousands of families adrift without so much as a passing glance at the Constitution,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nAn estimated one million Americans of Iranian descent reside in the United States, and Iran was the country most affected by the visa restriction in Mr. Trump\u2019s order. Roughly 35,000 Iranians come to the United States annually, more than any of the other countries on the list.\n\n\u201cThis travel ban has galvanized the Iranian-American community in unprecedented ways,\u201d Cyrus Mehri, a Washington-based Iranian-American civil rights lawyer, said in a news conference by telephone about the lawsuit. \u201cWe are gathering together and uniting to stop this ban not only for our community, but all others adversely affected.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tirades against Iran \u2014 he said on Twitter on Tuesday that the country was \u201c#1 in terror\u201d \u2014 have infuriated many Iranians, and many fear a return of sanctions and even military strikes. Still, others seem to appreciate that he is remarkably unpopular at home.\n\nIran\u2019s National Day celebration often features homemade versions of the American and Israeli flags going up in flames, as masses of Iranians gather in rallies that are a sign of ideological strength. It is also a day out for families and young people, who are as interested in the Chinese products being sold in stalls along the demonstration routes as they are in political sloganeering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCriticizing actions by hard-liners is dangerous in Iran, where the judiciary and the police are focusing increasingly on online dissent. In recent months in several Iranian provinces, social media users were arrested after they posted \u201cundesirable\u201d content or spoke out against the Islamic republic\u2019s policies.\n\nMany hard-liners responded online by criticizing those who had urged an end to flag-burning. One user posted images of American and Israeli flags on fire and a picture of an Iran Air commercial jetliner. \u201cWe don\u2019t burns flags without reason,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, referring to when an Iranian plane was shot down in 1988 by a missile from a United States Navy ship, killing 290 people. \u201cWe will burn flags again.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We insult those people when we burn their flag,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, some encourage these actions.\u201d\n\nBut hard-liners said it was their right to burn the American flag, or any flag for that matter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be thankful for Americans welcoming Iranians rendering services to that country,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst.\n\nHe also said that the United States had recently increased tensions with Iran. \u201cIt is clear some here are chickening out, and calling for compromise with America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we must burn the U.S. flag, as long as they are hostile to us.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas Erdbrink"], "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["iran", "political", "burn", "flag", "iranians", "united", "iranian", "sign", "saying", "states", "flags", "american"], "summary": "Roughly 35,000 Iranians come to the United States annually, more than any of the other countries on the list.\n\u201cWe will burn flags again.\u201dNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nWe insult those people when we burn their flag,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, some encourage these actions.\u201dBut hard-liners said it was their right to burn the American flag, or any flag for that matter.\n\u201cBut we must burn the U.S. flag, as long as they are hostile to us.\u201d"}
