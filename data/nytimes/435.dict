{"title": "Soviet-Era Program Gives Even Unoppressed Immigrants an Edge", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/us/ukrainian-christian-refugees.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cIn a world where people are persecuted in many places for varying reasons, refugee resettlement programs should not privilege one category but rather prioritize the most vulnerable with the most compelling need to be resettled,\u201d said Bill Frelick, the refugee director of Human Rights Watch. He called the program for the ex-Soviets, known as the Lautenberg Amendment, a \u201cCold War anachronism.\u201d\n\nThe 1990 amendment, which was proposed by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, established a legal presumption of eligibility for refugee status for Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. That is a more lenient standard than for other refugee applicants, who must prove they face a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nIranian religious minorities were added to the program in 2004. But Evangelical Christians make up more than 90 percent of the current Lautenberg pool, the vast majority of them from Ukraine.\n\nPhoto\n\nNearly 4,000 Ukrainian refugees were admitted to the United States in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, compared with 2,543 for the entire 2016 fiscal year and just 227 four years ago. Their 2017 numbers are dwarfed by arrivals from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Myanmar. But since May 1, as the Trump administration began to restrict admissions of refugees, Ukraine has accounted for the second-largest number of arrivals, behind only Congo.\n\nThe Supreme Court has allowed parts of President Trump\u2019s temporary travel moratorium to stand and will hear arguments this year about whether it is a legal use of his national security powers or illegally discriminates against Muslims, as opponents argue.\n\nIn response to questions, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services described the surge in Ukrainian arrivals as \u201cunrelated to the executive orders\u201d on travel issued by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn the 2017 refugee admissions report to Congress, the State Department said applications for the Lautenberg program had increased substantially since conflict erupted in Ukraine. Fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists has killed more than 2,000 civilians and thousands more fighters, and forced many people to move to other parts of the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRefugee experts say the situation in Ukraine pales in comparison with massacres and persecution of Yazidis, Kurds, Christians and Shiite Muslims in territories held by the Islamic State. A United Nations report last year described the widespread executions, enslavement and rapes of the Yazidis as genocide.\n\nNo one wanted to fault the Lautenberg program, though, noting the tenuous situation in Ukraine and the fact that Christian minorities, who are seen as being pro-West, are still vulnerable to persecution in pro-Russian areas.\n\nThe Lautenberg Amendment has also been instrumental in the past in giving Jews a way to safety. \u201cFor Iranian religious minorities, like Christians, Jews and Bahai, the Lautenberg Amendment is a lifesaver,\u201d said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a resettlement agency.\n\nOver the years, the Lautenberg Amendment has spawned a chain migration as beneficiaries settle in the United States and then file \u201caffidavits of relationship\u201d for close relatives who qualify as refugees as long as they belong to a historically persecuted Christian minority from the former Soviet Union.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Greater Portland, which includes Vancouver, is home to more than 100,000 Slavic Christians, who have erected dozens of churches at the epicenter of the community\u2019s life.\n\nIlya Globak, pastor of the large Ukrainian Bible Church, which the Davydyuks frequent, said the Lautenberg Amendment \u201chas brought much blessings on our people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBefore the Soviet Union collapsed, Evangelical Christian churches there operated underground. For the pastor, who arrived here in 1992 with his wife and 13 children, memories of baptisms held under the cover of darkness, relatives imprisoned for practicing their faith and Bibles confiscated by state agents are still fresh. Even today, he said, in a country where the Orthodox Church is dominant, Pentecostals often are derided as spies or cult members.\n\nIn March, Mr. Globak was among several Slavic pastors in the Northwest who sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Congress calling for the extension of the Lautenberg Amendment. Its annual renewal was delayed because it was pegged to an appropriations bill, but it was extended in May.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKen Demirjian, manager of Anoush Deli International Market, purveyor of borscht, sausages and other items favored by Slavic refugees, has witnessed the population explosion. \u201cWe used to be the only store for them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are four or five.\u201d\n\nAt the Vancouver office of Lutheran Community Services Northwest, a resettlement agency, 250 of the 265 arrivals this fiscal year have come from the former Soviet Union, including 200 from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe want to diversify the refugee population that we serve,\u201d said Mindy Johnston, the resettlement director, adding that more Ukrainian arrivals were scheduled.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Davydyuk, the Pentecostal who arrived in May, was invited to Vancouver by her sister, Lilia Volovodik. Ms. Volovodik\u2019s family settled here a decade ago, sponsored by a relative of her husband, who preceded them.\n\nPentecostals in Rovno, their hometown in western Ukraine, began to worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies would harm Lautenberg applicants. At her church, worshipers prayed for the program, Ms. Davydyuk said.\n\nUltimately, the Davydyuks were cleared to travel to the United States, arriving in Vancouver on May 30.\n\nMs. Davydyuk, who spoke in Russian through an interpreter, said she was thinking about sponsoring two sisters. Her 22-year-old son, Davyd, and his pregnant wife, Anhelina, who is expecting to give birth next month, have filed forms for her mother, father, sister, brother and sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better country,\u201d the mother-to-be said of the United States. \u201cIn Ukraine, it\u2019s so hard to live because of the economic and political instability.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother refugee couple, Anna and Daniel German, made a living in the wholesale flower business in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, until a bomb crashed into their greenhouses in August 2014. They fled to Odessa, and Mr. German\u2019s grandmother, in Vancouver since 1999, offered to sponsor them under the program that had benefited her own family.\n\n\u201cWe thought a little and decided to emigrate,\u201d recalled Mr. German, whose family is Baptist.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn their refugee application, they had to name the church they frequented and for how long.
