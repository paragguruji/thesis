As the administration continues to grapple with immigration policy, here are three books that examine how immigration has changed the American landscape and what a country owes to outsiders, while in the realm of fiction, a recent novel zeros in on the experiences of two young refugees.\n\nPhoto\n\nEXIT WEST\n\nBy Mohsin Hamid\n\n231 pp. Riverhead Books. (2017)\n\nWe find the protagonists of this novel, Nadia and Saeed, at a tipping point: Their unnamed city is \u201cswollen by refugees but still mostly at peace,\u201d and their love affair progresses as the atmosphere devolves into open warfare. Mohsin Hamid writes affectingly about how the casualties of war and violence can creep slowly into people\u2019s lives. Nadia and Saeed are upwardly mobile young professionals living cosmopolitan lives \u2014 they meet one evening at a corporate identity and product branding class \u2014 when they are forced to uproot in order to escape the truck bombs and armed soldiers overtaking their hometown. In a stroke of magic realism, the pair escape through a portal that transports them to a foreign, safer country. Hamid deftly captures the refugee experience and also imagines a near future when migration becomes the norm, exploring how the \u201cnatives\u201d of the host country learn to forge a new society with the incoming strangers.\n\nPhoto\n\nSTRANGERS IN OUR MIDST\n\nThe Political Philosophy of Immigration\n\nBy David Miller\n\n218 pp. Harvard University Press. (2016)\n\nIn this book, David Miller, a political philosopher, tackles the question of what a developed country owes to outsiders when imagining its immigration policies. He argues that a state should have the right to govern its borders however it wishes, so long as the method is fair and transparent. At the root of his argument is the idea of \u201cweak cosmopolitanism.\u201d While strong cosmopolitanism, he writes, would mandate an international \u201copen borders\u201d policy, weak cosmopolitanism allows for discernment when it comes to inviting outsiders into a country\u2019s borders, except in cases when there is a moral responsibility to protect others\u2019 human rights, such as those fleeing genocide. Miller also argues that citizens should be allowed to mold their own vision for their country and protect it by admitting only those who may adhere to it.\n\nPhoto\n\nA NATION OF NATIONS\n\nA Great American Immigration Story\n\nBy Tom Gjelten\n\n405 pp. Simon & Schuster. (2015)\n\nImmigration to the United States was transformed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which made laws less restrictive and strongly favored family reunification; whereas most foreigners who came to the United States before were white and European, over the last 50 years the pool has diversified, bringing people from South America, Asia and Africa. In \u201cA Nation of Nations,\u201d Tom Gjelten focuses on how this shift has affected one county: Fairfax in Virginia, which saw its foreign-born population grow sevenfold in the three decades following the passage of the act. Gjelten introduces a cast of characters \u2014 some immigrants, some locals \u2014 to demonstrate how they have forged a new reality and what has brought them together.", "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "authors": "Concepci\u00f3n De Le\u00f3n", "type": "article"}
