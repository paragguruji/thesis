It would add sanctions and allow Congress to block presidential efforts to reduce existing sanctions. That is a necessary precaution given that Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness for President Vladimir Putin could cause him to prematurely lift the penalties imposed for the invasion of Ukraine and meddling in the American election.\n\nIn another effort to correct a bad decision by Mr. Trump, the Senate tried to block a $500 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia, which on Wednesday underwent a major leadership shuffle in the ruling royal family. The arms sale makes the United States complicit with the Saudis in the civil war in Yemen, which has killed untold numbers of civilians. The measure failed, but received more support than it had in the past.\n\nAnd after dragging its feet for years, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday began considering legislation intended to assert more power over military troop deployments. The president has largely ceded that authority to the Pentagon. Meanwhile, many legislators have vowed not to approve Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which would decimate the State Department. On a more granular level, a few senators have taken it upon themselves to smooth the ruffled feathers between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders.\n\nTo some extent, these battles are simply the latest manifestation of the long historical struggle for control over national security policy between the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThe Constitution divides war-making between the Congress, which controls taxes and spending, and the president, who is vested with executive power and the power to act as the military\u2019s commander in chief.\n\nSince 9/11, there has been a striking expansion of the president\u2019s executive power, particularly in the area of national security, and there is little doubt that the executive, in this case Mr. Trump, remains the most influential player on the world stage. But that does not mean that Congress has to remain silent, or shy from challenging any president on national security issues, correcting or mitigating mistakes that could threaten the nation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is even a hint of bipartisanship in this particular Congress\u2019s efforts to compensate for this particular executive.
