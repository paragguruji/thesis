However, he is worried about home schooling receiving federal money, a scenario he characterizes as a \u201csuffocating embrace.\u201d One need only look at the charter school movement \u2014 the \u201cone-time new frontier of school choice and innovation\u201d \u2014 to see how government funding leads to an \u201cincreasingly rule-setting, bureaucratized model\u201d of education.

If we consign people to live in poverty, people will die. If we take away health insurance, people will die. It has become increasingly harder for the G.O.P. to justify these deaths with anything remotely resembling sensible policy, so now it seeks to take them out of the equation altogether.\u201d\n\nMs. Chang offers a rebuttal to the conservative argument that it is inappropriate to cast the health care debate in terms of life or death. She says doing so is a \u201ccomplete divorce from the policy itself.\u201d And she goes on to point out that the majority of people crafting the bill and commenting on it in the media are distanced from its effects personally.

Robinson in Current Affairs:\n\n\u201cThere are, surprisingly enough, a number of people who do not subscribe to the belief that democracy is good.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Robinson finds thinkers across the political spectrum trying to use the era of Trump and global populism to make a fashionable argument against \u201ctoo much democracy.\u201d He notes that elites dismissing populism miss the point that they are the ruling political class being displaced and \u201cthe old clich\u00e9 about democracy being the worst form of government except for all the others remains as true as ever.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\n\u2022 Maha Hilal in Foreign Policy in Focus:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a U.S. citizen. I\u2019m also Muslim. And the Supreme Court decision on the Trump administration\u2019s Muslim travel ban scares me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Hilal writes that the travel ban magnifies the \u201clegitimate fear that one will either be targeted by state violence or become a target of societal violence.\u201d She writes that being told to trust in the democratic process and courts system is a challenge for groups that have felt historically disenfranchised under what she calls \u201ca long history of discriminatory, racist, and Islamophobic policies under several administrations.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nAnd Finally, From the Center:\n\n\u2022 Charles Lane in The Washington Post:\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should change the subject, from how high we set the wage to how we set it, period.\u201d\n\nTwo studies have reached conflicting conclusions about how Seattle\u2019s minimum wage increase affected employment rates in the city. The result was not unexpected: Partisans on either side of the issue became more entrenched. But in this op-ed, Mr. Lane argues that we need \u201ca more intellectually honest\u201d debate that establishes a \u201crelatively objective process\u201d for setting the minimum wage.

And just because his greatest supporters are \u201clearning to live with something they know they can\u2019t change\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that it should be taken as a broader acceptance of this behavior.

This unsigned editorial from the state capital\u2019s newspaper argues that Republicans should \u201cstop the rush, and include Democrats and health-care experts from outside the Beltway in crafting a new overhaul.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nWant the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?
