Ticking off reasons ranging from his promise of a Muslim ban to his flirtation with Vladimir Putin, Wittes stressed Trump\u2019s propensity for promising outcomes through force of personality rather than policies and programs. \u201cIn the national security space, it is a particularly pernicious lie,\u201d he concluded. \u201cOur tools are too dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe warning was an early sign of the opposition to Trump that has since hardened among the national-security professionals and observers for whom Lawfare serves as a kind of bulletin board. Wittes, an author and a former editorial writer for The Washington Post, started the blog in 2010, with Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former Bush Justice Department official, and Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who served on a detention-policy task force for Obama. Published in partnership with the Brookings Institution, Lawfare has developed into a go-to bipartisan site for remarkably speedy and informed analysis about all matters related to \u201cHard National Security Choices,\u201d as the blog\u2019s tag line puts it, including counterterrorism and immigration.\n\nWith a steady stream of writing by law professors and law students as well as former Bush and Obama officials, Lawfare has helped translate and test the legal and policy framework that lawyers in the military and intelligence communities have hammered out. During the Obama years, the blog\u2019s staff and contributors shared ideas with the top of the national-security hierarchy. \u201cThey\u2019d reach out to me, and I\u2019d reach out to them,\u201d says Avril Haines, who was Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser.\n\nIn the Trump era, the blog has at once lost its cachet in the highest echelons of government and become relevant to a far larger audience as the writers train their expertise on the biggest controversies of the new presidency. Lawfare contributors still have deep ties throughout the national-security and foreign-service career ranks, and many posts reflect their shared concerns about Trump and his team.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s one of the many curiosities of this presidency that the commander in chief whose administration has little connection to Lawfare has also given the blog its biggest moment in the sun. In February, Trump tweeted \u201cLAWFARE\u201d and quoted a line Wittes wrote criticizing the Court of Appeals ruling that blocked the administration\u2019s Jan. 27 refugee-and-travel ban. The president was probably reacting to the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d which aired the same quote on-screen just before the president\u2019s tweet. Trump presumably didn\u2019t realize that in that piece and an earlier one, Wittes shredded the January ban as the product of \u201cincompetent malevolence\u201d and supported the court\u2019s decision over all. \u201cYou decide whether the POTUS is quoting me in context,\u201d Wittes tweeted back, linking to his post on the court ruling.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

In January, Ira Glass invited Wittes on \u201cThis American Life\u201d to talk about the January refugee-and-travel ban. \u201cTwo days ago, I\u2019d never heard of you, and now you\u2019re my new best friend,\u201d Glass wrote to Wittes. There\u2019s something very unlikely about liberals\u2019 embracing Lawfare: Before Trump, the blog\u2019s closeness to the national-security community made it \u201csomewhat disreputable\u201d to the left, Wittes told me, half-kiddingly. Lawfare observes rules that most publications don\u2019t, including a pledge never to publish classified information. Contributors generally tend to be hawkish and \u201cmore sympathetic to the executive, and more accepting of the seriousness of the counterterrorism threat and the need for tools like targeting and surveillance, than a lot of writers in the national-security space,\u201d Goldsmith says.", "authors": ["Emily Bazelon"], "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["blog", "trump", "national", "ban", "wonky", "security", "big", "wittes", "hit", "lawfare", "sign", "nationalsecurity", "law"], "summary": "PhotoA little over a year ago, Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of the blog Lawfare, made the case that Donald Trump, as a Republican presidential candidate, represented nothing less than a national-security threat.\n\u201cNever before in my lifetime has either political party been led by a man with such an unusual combination of \u2014 from a national security perspective, anyway \u2014 terrifying liabilities,\u201d Wittes wrote.\n\u201cIn the national security space, it is a particularly pernicious lie,\u201d he concluded.\nDuring the Obama years, the blog\u2019s staff and contributors shared ideas with the top of the national-security hierarchy.\n\u201cThey\u2019d reach out to me, and I\u2019d reach out to them,\u201d says Avril Haines, who was Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser."}
