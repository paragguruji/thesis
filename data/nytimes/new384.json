One of the things the police, all of us, need to do is make sure we\u2019re as safe as we possibly can be. I\u2019m reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as safe as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nMr. Khan\u2019s office later dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s post, saying the mayor was too busy to reply. \u201cHe has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police \u2014 including armed officers \u2014 on the streets,\u201d his office said in a statement.\n\nVideo\n\nThe exchange reflected the tensions between Mr. Trump and the United States\u2019 close allies in Europe. The president returned a little more than a week ago from Belgium and Italy, where he questioned the role of NATO. Then, once home, he followed up by criticizing Germany on trade and pulling the United States out of the Paris climate change accord.\n\nThe friction has been especially acute for more than a year between Mr. Trump and Mr. Khan, the first Muslim to serve as mayor of a major Western European capital. During last year\u2019s presidential race, Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and endorsed Hillary Clinton, prompting an exchange with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nCritics of Mr. Trump in Britain and the United States faulted him for his acrimonious response to the Saturday assault. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who\u2019s trying to organize his city\u2019s response to this attack,\u201d former Vice President Al Gore said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\n\nDamon Wilson, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s top Europe adviser and is now the executive vice president of the Atlantic Council, lamented that the spat only undercut a relationship that mattered to the United States. \u201cAmerica is safer when we rally our friends and allies against the bad guys rather than pick fights with the good guys,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the White House showed no signs of backing down, and a top aide to Mr. Trump amplified the attack shortly afterward. Dan Scavino Jr., the president\u2019s director of social media, posted a message referring to Mr. Khan\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump a year ago for his \u201cignorant view of Muslims.\u201d\n\nAddressing Mr. Khan, Mr. Scavino referred to his \u201ctweet 13 months ago, after you criticized ... now President @realDonaldTrump \u2014 and WAKE UP!!!!\u201d\n\nOther American officials sought to smooth over the dispute. \u201cI commend the strong leadership of the @MayorofLondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack,\u201d Lewis Lukens, a career diplomat serving as acting American ambassador to London, wrote on Twitter hours later.\n\nThis is just the latest time the American Embassy in London has had to manage turbulence in the relationship since Mr. Trump took office. The London government complained vociferously after the White House aired a conspiracy theory that British intelligence helped President Barack Obama secretly spy on Mr. Trump during last year\u2019s campaign, which Britain denied. London complained again when American officials leaked details of the investigation into last month\u2019s terrorist bombing in Manchester.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s initial arguments about the meaning of Saturday night\u2019s terrorist attack stirred debate both at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d he wrote in one message Saturday night.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

At the time, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban applied to all Muslims from all countries who were not American citizens, but Mr. Trump said he welcomed Mr. Khan\u2019s election and would make an exception for him.\n\nMr. Khan replied that he wanted no exception and accused Mr. Trump of harboring \u201cignorant views about Islam.\u201d Mr. Khan said Mr. Trump would only encourage Muslim alienation from the West. \u201cHe\u2019s playing into the hands of extremists,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Scavino, at the time, fired back on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, writing on Twitter that it was not ignorance: \u201cIt\u2019s called not being \u2018politically correct.\u2019 @realDonaldTrump will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nThe feud continued after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. In March, after a terrorist attack in London, Donald Trump Jr. posted a link suggesting that Mr. Khan had said terrorist attacks were just \u201cpart of living in big city.\u201d In fact, what Mr. Khan had said was that \u201cpart and parcel of living in a great global city\u201d was being vigilant against terrorism and supporting the police.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "publish_date": "2017-06-04", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["offthecuff", "foreign", "tweets", "trump", "terrorist", "united", "trumps", "london", "ties", "states", "president", "mr", "strain", "khan", "attack"], "summary": "\u201cLondoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days,\u201d Mr. Khan said.\nDuring last year\u2019s presidential race, Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and endorsed Hillary Clinton, prompting an exchange with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\nMr. Trump\u2019s initial arguments about the meaning of Saturday night\u2019s terrorist attack stirred debate both at home and abroad.\nMr. Khan replied that he wanted no exception and accused Mr. Trump of harboring \u201cignorant views about Islam.\u201d Mr. Khan said Mr. Trump would only encourage Muslim alienation from the West.\nMr. Scavino, at the time, fired back on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, writing on Twitter that it was not ignorance: \u201cIt\u2019s called not being \u2018politically correct.\u2019 @realDonaldTrump will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!\u201dThe feud continued after Mr. Trump\u2019s election."}
