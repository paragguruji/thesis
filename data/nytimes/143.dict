{"title": "Obama Speaks Up, Praising Protests and Opposing Religious Test", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html?mcubz=0", "text": "Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president said:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy \u2014 not just during an election but every day. Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake. With regard to comparisons to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions, as we\u2019ve heard before, the president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewis also let it be known that Mr. Obama never, ever supported a ban on Muslim immigration. He helpfully sent out this quote from November of 2015, as Congress was moving to legislate a ban on Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution \u2014 that\u2019s shameful. That\u2019s not American. That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nAmerica First \u2014 again\n\nThe United States got its second America First committee on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe first was created in 1940 to keep the nation out of World War II, with its best-known associate being Charles Lindbergh, the aviator who was a vocal supporter of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe latest one was created by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies and former advisers, the America First Policies committee, an outside group that will support the president, pushing back on opposition to his stances and eventually running advertisements to support him.\n\nThe group is being led by strategists Nick Ayers and Rick Gates, as well as Marty Obst and Brad Parscale, who led Mr. Trump\u2019s digital efforts during the campaign. Two other strategists who worked with the Trump campaign, David Bossie and Katrina Pierson, will work with the group.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on a bold but basic concept: America First,\u201d the statement from the group said.\n\n\u201cThis is a concept the American people both understand and support, but few in the media recognize and many politicians beholden to special interests will oppose,\u201d the officials said. \u201cWe will provide the counterbalance.\u201d\n\nThe group appears to be officially sanctioned by the Trump apparatus, and came together after bitter debate among factions during the campaign. It is expected to be funded in part by the father-daughter donors Rebekah and Bob Mercer, two supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his counselor, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe phrase \u201cAmerica First\u201d was used by Mr. Trump after he won the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. He used it again in his inauguration address. Mr. Trump has said he was familiar with the negative connotations of the phrase. But he has said it captured his approach to governing.\n\n20,000 refugees impacted by the ban, U.N. says\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said an estimated 20,000 refugees from all over the world would be impacted immediately by the executive order that freezes refugee resettlement for 120 days. Many more Syrian refugees are affected by the indefinite suspension of resettlement of Syrians.\n\nThe statement pointed to a provision in international law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion or nationality. The executive order bars nationals of seven countries, including Syria. \u201cThe High Commissioner underlines once again\u201d the organization\u2019s \u201cposition that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, is a Jordanian \u2014 and Jordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, is in Washington.\n\nThe refugee agency is mandated to protect the rights of refugees. It also relies on the United States for 40 percent of its funding.\n\nThe agency said it was \u201calarmed at the impact\u201d of the executive order.\n\nThose who are referred for resettlement, it said, \u201care the most vulnerable \u2014 such as people needing urgent medical assistance, survivors of torture, and women and girls at risk. The new homes provided by resettlement countries are lifesaving for people who have no other options.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations officials in charge of preparing refugees for resettlement were told by the State Department on Sunday morning to plan on halting medical screenings, travel schedules and orientation sessions for all refugees in the pipeline for resettlement to the United States.\n\nThe guidance went on to explain that nationals of seven prohibited countries would not be allowed to board planes for the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe backlash continues to grow\n\nIran has banned visas for Americans. Iraq\u2019s Parliament appears to be following suit.\n\nCareer foreign service officers have drafted a stinging dissent, declaring, \u201cWe are better than this ban.\u201d\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, visiting the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Monday, declared, \u201cIt\u2019s discrimination. We want an urgent clarification as soon as possible from the Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this:\n\nUnintended consequences have a way of getting out of hand when policies are made a bit hastily.\n\nPeople are speaking out \u2014 through The New York Times\n\nThe reaction to President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration was unusual by at least one standard \u2014 it attracted more comments than any article in nytimes.com history.\n\nJudge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide received 10,363 comment submissions. Of those, 8,448 were approved by the journalists who moderate comments and posted on The Times\u2019s site.\n\nThe story, which was opened for reader submissions on Saturday morning, narrowly outpaced an October 2016 article about James Comey\u2019s surprise letter to Congress announcing that emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server had been found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer.\n\nThe most popular comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order came from a reader called tbriggs27 in Longmont, Colo., who wrote:\n\n\u201cAs a patriot and veteran I am sickened by this callous disregard for people who are critical to the safety of our men and women in combat. As an American I am sickened by the religious test. We can never have liberty and freedom when we deny it to others. This is unsustainable.\u201d\n\nThat comment attracted 324 comment replies and was recommended by 9,178 registered readers of The Times.\n\nA Supreme Court announcement on TV from the White House\n\nThe Supreme Court \u2014 cosseted, cordial and militantly untelevised \u2014 is going prime time on live TV, with Mr. Trump announcing on Twitter that he will announce his pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.),\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on his personal Twitter account at 8:43 a.m. \u2014 timed perfectly to catch the top-of-the-hour news roundups.\n\nThe president had originally planned to make the announcement on Thursday, but he had a rough weekend after protests over his executive order temporarily banning migrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries forced the Department of Homeland Security to decree that permanent residents would, for the most part, be exempted from the crackdown.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s shortlist of three federal appeals judges, culled from media accounts and confirmed by people close to the process, is: Neil M. Gorsuch of Colorado, Thomas M. Hardiman of Pennsylvania and William H. Pryor of Alabama, who was originally favored to be the pick.\n\nThe president has never shrunk from the theatrical aspects of his job.\n\nSome Iraqis May Avoid Immigration Ban\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to send the White House a list of Iraqi citizens who have served with American forces with the recommendation that they be exempt from President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, administration officials said on Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon list is intended to address a major criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration: that it will stop the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.\n\nSome Iraqi military officials with family in the United States, who have also reportedly been affected by the decree, could also benefit from the Pentagon list, which will also be sent to Homeland Security.\n\nMr. Mattis was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the executive order on immigration, which temporarily blocks Iraqi citizens from entering the United States for 90 days. Six other predominantly Muslim countries are covered by the edict: Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.\n\nThe White House has argued that the temporary ban is needed so that the United States can develop procedures for the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of travelers from nations that have been stricken by terrorism. Officials said that the Iraqis who will be put on the Pentagon list have already undergone a stringent form of vetting: serving with the United States military in combat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSchumer\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019 on nominations, across the board\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, approached his new job as the anti-Harry Reid: Yes, he would fight President Trump where he needed to, but he made it clear he really wanted to find areas of cooperation.\n\nThat may not be happening.\n\nDriven by the executive order on immigration and by the vociferous demands of the increasingly activist Democratic base, Mr. Schumer announced on Monday that he would oppose President Trump\u2019s nominees pretty much across the board: No on Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Representative Mick Mulvaney for budget director, Representative Tom Price for secretary of health and human services, Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary, Scott Pruitt for E.P.A. chief and Andy Puzder for labor secretary.\n\nCooperation, it seems, is over.\n\n\u201cAfter the first week of the Trump presidency it\u2019s clear our country is at a cross roads. In his first week in office the president has stomped over our proud American tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees, trafficked in alternative facts, and is attempting to fill his cabinet with billionaires and bankers. What kind of country do we want to be: one that helps the middle class and those struggling to get there or one that further rigs the system in favor of the special interests?\u201d\n\nIt might not have helped that Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Schumer for his tearful denunciation of his immigration order.\n\n\u201cI noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with the fake tears,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday during a meeting with small-business leaders. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask him who was his acting coach, because I know him very well. I don\u2019t see him as a crier.\u201d\n\nCalm down, Trump says, few were detained\n\nBesieged by criticism, with chaos at international airports mounting and protests proliferating, Mr. Trump defended the aftermath of his executive order halting immigration from the seven countries, saying that problems at airports were the fault of a Delta Airline computer error.\n\nDelta said it fixed its system problems after a few hours on Sunday night. The chaos lasted the whole weekend.\n\nAlso, if there ever was a Mr. Nice Guy, he is no more.\n\nAnd, the president said, he had to spring the order on the world \u2014 the element of surprise keeps the nation safe. Also, he seems to have acknowledged that it is a \u201cban,\u201d a term the Trump administration has denounced as hyperbole.\n\nThat swipe at Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was a reference to the senator choking up on Sunday as he recounted his family\u2019s immigrant experience.\n\nJewish Republican groups mildly peeved at White House\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition and the Zionist Organization of America have tried really hard to stay on Mr. Trump\u2019s good side.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the campaign, when Trump supporters unloaded vicious anti-Semitic invectives on journalists, the Republican Jewish Coalition condemned expressions of hate by supporters of all candidates. The Zionist organization latched on to Mr. Trump\u2019s America First program and backed his conservative, pro-settler pick to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman.\n\nWhen the White House released a statement on Friday commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day without mentioning Jews, they were pretty quiet, even as the Anti-Defamation League condemned the omission.\n\nBut on Sunday, after Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, confirmed that the decision to not mention Jews in the statement was intentional, the two Jewish groups were upset, mildly. Ms. Hicks justified the decision by saying, \u201cDespite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition, not exactly sputtering with rage, released a statement:\n\n\u201cAs supporters of President Trump, we know that he holds in his heart the memory of the six million victims of the Holocaust, and is committed not just to their memory, but ensuring it never happens again.\u201d \u201cThe lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi\u2019s final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nMorton A. Klein, the national president of the Zionist organization, was a little stronger:\n\n\u201cEspecially as a child of Holocaust survivors, I and Z.O.A. are compelled to express our chagrin and deep pain at President Trump, in his Holocaust Remembrance Day message, omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.\u201d\n\nReince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, did not sound all that apologetic on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cI mean, everyone\u2019s suffering in the Holocaust, including obviously all of the Jewish people affected, and the miserable genocide that occurred is something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad and something that can never be forgotten,\u201d he said.\n\nOh, and he mentioned that some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family \u2014 alluding to Ivanka, his daughter, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law \u2014 are Jewish.\n\nTrump\u2019s other objective: Call it ISIS\n\nMr. Trump said during the campaign that he had a secret plan to fight the Islamic State. Eight days into his presidency, he seems to have revealed a small part of it.\n\nCall it ISIS.\n\nAn executive memorandum that Mr. Trump signed in the Oval Office on Saturday afternoon repeatedly referred to the Islamic State as ISIS \u2014 not ISIL, as former President Barack Obama and the rest of the federal government called the terrorist group; and not Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the group, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it while standing next to the president last week in the East Room of the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, in other words, ISIS,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed the memorandum, which called on the Pentagon to devise a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d within 30 days.\n\nThis is a big issue for the president. As he said in late 2015, before his campaign heated up:\n\nIn May 2016, Mr. Trump again brought up the issue, saying in an interview with Bloomberg Politics: \u201cThe president of the United States always says \u2018ISIL.\u2019 Everyone else says \u2018ISIS.\u2019 And I actually think he does it to bother people.\u201d\n\nRush Limbaugh accused Mr. Obama of using ISIL to delegitimize Israel \u2014 naturally. (Don\u2019t ask, it doesn\u2019t make sense.)\n\nIn fact, the former president thought the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was more delegitimizing than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which denoted the territory the group holds.\n\nWell, elections have consequences.\n\nRepublicans and the art of saying nothing\n\nDemocratic lawmakers greeted Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order barring visitors and immigrants from the seven Muslim countries with unmistakable broadsides.\n\nAs protests mounted and criticism grew, Republicans slowly began to speak out, but most of the coordinated response seemed to be, We like what the president is doing, and maybe he could have done things a little differently.\n\nTake Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who once called the Obama administration the most corrupt presidency in history, until Mr. Issa nearly lost his seat and claimed he had cooperated with Mr. Obama. His district appears to be getting more ethnically diverse, but it still has affluent Republican strongholds that have helped him remain in power since 2003. The statement takes the Republican nonposition to an art form:\n\n\u201cAmerica is a nation of immigrants. Our country has been built by the hard work of those who\u2019ve come here for liberty and to find hope in a land of opportunity. A welcoming America is not incompatible with a strong and secure America. We can put in place a vetting process that the American people have confidence in. To do so, the Congress must work with the administration to swiftly reestablish strong and clear screening procedures so that our rich tradition of immigration is not permanently threatened by those who wish us harm.\u201d\n\nDemocrats demand investigation into Homeland Security\n\nRichard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Illinois\u2019 two Democratic senators, demanded an independent investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security into the way it carried out Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.\n\nThe call came amid reports that Customs and Border Protection repeatedly ignored judicial orders to release travelers from detention facilities at airports across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are particularly alarmed by allegations that C.B.P. officers and potentially other department personnel failed to comply with a temporary restraining order,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cThe United States Constitution means little if law enforcement agents disregard it, or if Americans are unwilling to defend its principles and respect foundational constitutional rights, from due process to equal protection under the law. The American people are relying on your independent investigators to serve as a check against a powerful law enforcement agency that may be violating the civil rights of LPRs and operating in violation of the law.\u201d\n\nJordanian king will have breakfast with Pence\n\nJordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, is scheduled to have breakfast on Monday with Vice President Mike Pence at the vice president\u2019s residence a few miles from the White House. He would certainly like to get a little closer than that.\n\nAmid turmoil over Mr. Trump\u2019s order to halt entries from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the king probably has issues he would like to bring up with the man signing the executive orders. But Mr. Trump does not appear keen to host Abdullah II at the White House, certainly not before Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pays a visit.\n\nJordan\u2019s king will also be meeting with leaders on Capitol Hill. They are likely to get an earful.\n\nTo criticize Trump, senators lean on a friend\n\nMaybe senators are so scared of Mr. Trump that they need a friend for support.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Of course, those two are practically their own political party \u2014 called McGraham by some, Jindsey by others.\n\nThen Senators Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, released their own buddy-gram, positing \u201cunanswered questions and concerns\u201d and some general \u201cuneasy\u201d feelings.\n\nOf course, teaming up hasn\u2019t stopped the president from taking his shots, as he did to Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham.\n\nBut maybe it doesn\u2019t hurt as much when you have a friend.", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Somini Sengupta, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush", "type": "article"}
