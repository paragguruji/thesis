During his confirmation hearing as department secretary last month, John F. Kelly stressed the need to build trust with Muslim communities.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s possible move aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to defeat what he called \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d as well as with the views of some of his advisers. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s top strategist, has said that Islam is not a religion of peace, while Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, once said that fear of Muslims was rational.\n\nCounterterrorism experts say that the administration risks eroding years of bridge building between the government and Muslim communities, which have long been suspicious of the counterextremism programs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

M. Berger, a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague and co-author of \u201cISIS: The State of Terror.\u201d \u201cThose fears may now be justified.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nErroll G. Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States.\n\nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. From 2009 to 2016, according to figures from the Anti-Defamation League, these groups accounted for 84 percent of the extremist violence in which shots were exchanged with law enforcement.\n\n\u201cData should dictate policy,\u201d Mr. Southers said. \u201cIf you ignore data, you ignore the real problem, which is that extremism comes from a diverse range of sources.\u201d\n\nThe federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations saying they stigmatize entire communities.\n\nIn Minneapolis, some groups have participated in a program run by the local United States attorney to counter Islamic State propaganda efforts directed at Somalis. But other groups have criticized the government\u2019s efforts, saying they are overwhelmingly focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities and pay little attention to the threats posed by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists.\n\nFaiza Patel, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent Extremism Program would make a bad project worse.\n\n\u201cIt makes explicit what was already implied in C.V.E.,\u201d she said. \u201cNow all of that window dressing goes out the door.\u201d\n\nDespite millions of dollars in government-sponsored research, there remains no consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist or how to identify such people before they attack.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClark R. McCauley Jr., a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years, said that programs to counter extremism were already too focused on Islamic terrorism. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that easy to get money to study right-wing stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big oversupply of attention to Islamic extremism as it is.\u201d\n\nMaking that focus more explicit may not significantly change how the programs operate, he said. \u201cBut what it will mean for Muslims in the U.S., that\u2019s going to be a problem, even if the machinery doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Professor McCauley said. \u201cIt means the country has decided to say, \u2018You people are a special threat.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristian Picciolini, the founder of Life After Hate, a Chicago group devoted to countering right-wing extremism, said it would be dangerous to minimize white extremism, pointing to gunmen like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and Wade Michael Page, who killed six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.\n\n\u201cThey are being radicalized by fake news and conspiracy theories,\u201d he said of such attackers. \u201cWe are ignoring a massive domestic terrorism problem that already exists in our borders.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "authors": "Ron Nixon, Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo", "type": "article"}
