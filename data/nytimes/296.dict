Reaction to the new restrictions seems destined to reprise that to Mr. Trump\u2019s original order in January, and it echoes the Butcher\u2019s oft-quoted line from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry VI, Part 2.\u201d There is a crucial one-word change, though. This version goes: \u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s call all the lawyers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what opponents of the travel ban did in January. In short order, legal teams formed to represent immigrants who were suddenly detained at airports, with nowhere to go. Their challenge to presidential authority was sustained by federal judges, and their motivation underpins this short video from Retro Report, a documentary series that mines the past for guidance as to what may lie ahead. The focus is on a network of current and former students at Yale Law School who helped draft a legal petition that became part of the pushback that stopped the first Trump order in its tracks.\n\nFor Michael J.

They sought asylum in the United States, but instead were sent to the American naval base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and held behind barbed wire. Ultimately, a federal judge ordered that more than 150 Haitians be released and allowed to enter the United States.", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": "Clyde Haberman", "type": "article"}
