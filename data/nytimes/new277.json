I\u2019ve made fun of Canada\u2019s indiscriminate niceness for years, but I now see our friends to the north have more than thick-cut bacon going for them. Canadian bacon really is delicious. I especially like it as a winter snack, broiled in brown sugar and maple syrup and accompanied with a glass of icy Champagne. What\u2019s the president tweeting today? \u201cOur legal system is broken.\u201d Leave the bottle.\n\nI must confess: I do find blaming Mr. Trump a pleasant change from the things I usually blame for my overeating: a miserable love life; an ecstatic love life; the stress of too much to do; the stress of nothing to do; a mother who is driving me crazy; a mother who, thanks to a major stroke three years ago, is certifiably crazy.\n\nMy mother, living in a Westchester nursing home, was my primary trigger for eating the wrong stuff for the past few months. She had developed an obsession with newborn babies, particularly boys.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the nursery and look at the babies,\u201d she\u2019d say.\n\n\u201cThat would be really nice, Ma, but they don\u2019t have a nursery here,\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\n\u201cYes, they do,\u201d Ma would say. \u201cWith the boys, the nurses have to wash their little penises.\u201d\n\nIt got me down, particularly the penis bit, which made me think my mother had pitched her tent in Krafft-Ebing territory. But one of my brothers stocks my mother\u2019s room with chocolate covered biscuits and Hershey\u2019s Kisses and cookies, so relief was never more than three feet away.\n\nAre you non-Weight Watchers aware that one Hershey\u2019s Kiss is the equivalent of a pat of butter? Give me a half-hour with my mother and I am good for a double handful; I inhale those suckers as if in a trance, and when I come to my senses, the floor is awash in silver confetti. It should be a wake-up call. But I know there is orange marzipan in the bureau under the television and I have not hit bottom yet.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Around this time, Ma, who had been a big traveler before her stroke, also has a new idea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something we need to talk about,\u201d she tells me very seriously when I arrive. \u201cThere\u2019s a trip I want to take, but it\u2019s going to cost $20,000.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNo problem, Ma, you can afford it,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars,\u201d Ma says.\n\n(Bonus caregiver tip: If you\u2019re having trouble determining whether your loved one has early dementia or has progressed to advanced and he or she starts discussing space travel, no more need to wonder. They\u2019ve arrived.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready for tourists on Mars, Ma,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe you read a story about it, but I think it probably said that one day people will be going to Mars.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re doing it right now,\u201d Ma says. \u201cI was thinking of asking my sister. But you know Betty, she never wants to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nAn aide takes Ma to the bathroom. I talk to two of the other visiting daughters about the Muslim travel ban. We\u2019re all upset about it. One of the daughters says that there is a fear that Muslims will be forced to register and that former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright just tweeted that if that happens, she will register as a Muslim in solidarity. I have the feeling of unreality I had during 9/11. Meanwhile, down the hall, two female residents with dementia are having screaming meltdowns.\n\nThe world has gone crazy, I think; I am literally in a madhouse, and the people outside have also gone mad. At least, unlike those poor screaming women, my mother is usually happy in her delusions. And she\u2019s well taken care of. Thank heavens Medicaid will be in place when she runs through her money at this $180,000 a year nursing home.\n\nOr will it?\n\nHershey\u2019s Kisses.
