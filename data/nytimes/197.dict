He became a United States citizen decades ago.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

But Mr. Khan said he hoped the courts would provide a bulwark against the president\u2019s actions against immigrants.\n\nHe said he understood Mr. Goodell\u2019s decision not to make a public statement, to avoid the appearance of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d on the president\u2019s action. Instead, Mr. Khan said, the league should see how the issue plays out in court.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at it based on what can we do to make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd right now, there are enough forces in power and play that we have to see how this thing ends up.\u201d\n\nMr. Khan has been a vocal supporter of a bill in Jacksonville, Fla., that would expand the city\u2019s human rights ordinance to offer more protection for people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Similar laws have passed in other cities in nearly two dozen states. Mr. Khan said that he knew endorsing the bill might alienate some Jaguars fans but that he was willing to risk season-ticket cancellations.\n\n\u201cI have no remorse over supporting it,\u201d he said of the nondiscrimination bill.\n\nDespite his opposition to the president\u2019s immigration policies, Mr. Khan, a registered Republican who said he had voted for Mr. Trump, supports his economic plans, specifically the emphasis on creating manufacturing jobs. Mr. Khan said his company opened or announced plans to build new factories in seven states last year, as well as in China, Mexico and Spain.\n\nHe has some reservations about Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States signed with Canada and Mexico and which took effect in 1994. Consumers over all have benefited from Nafta, Mr. Khan said, and his business could be hurt if the president changes the agreement. But Mr. Khan said he would support changes if they helped create manufacturing jobs in the United States like the ones he had when he arrived a half-century ago.\n\n\u201cIn a way, Nafta is like a scrambled egg,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cHow do you unscramble an egg? The value chains are so interwoven that it would be very difficult to do that. But government policies force us to look for ways to unscramble it.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": "Ken Belson", "type": "article"}
