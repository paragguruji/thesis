Lawmakers Criticize Trump\u2019s Refugee Policy", "text": "Mr. McCain also said the plan was carried out without proper consultation of United States allies and that it mistakenly lumped together the country\u2019s adversaries, like Iran, with allies, like Iraq.\n\nRepublicans have largely supported Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive agenda, but in his first major decision on national security, he is finding uncharacteristic opposition from his party in the blush of his early days in office.\n\nMr. Trump did not take well to the input, singling out Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter as \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d\n\nBut as the day went on, they were not alone in their criticisms. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that while he supported stronger screening, the order had been \u201cpoorly implemented,\u201d especially for green card holders. \u201cThe administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated,\u201d Mr. Corker said.\n\nIndeed, the administration moved to ease some of those concerns late Sunday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced that lawful permanent residents would be exempt from the ban.\n\nSenator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, likewise said the order was \u201coverly broad\u201d and that the blanket travel ban \u201cgoes too far.\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seemed to echo those criticisms, adding that \u201cwhile not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one, which is inconsistent with our American character.\u201d\n\nSenator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, went further, questioning the hastiness of the order\u2019s rollout and calling for a re-evaluation of the White House\u2019s unilateral effort. \u201cIn my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security and again for this notion that America has always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\u201d Mr. Portman said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilar concerns were voiced by some Republicans in the House. Most prominent among them was Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who said that \u201cit was clear\u201d that adjustments were needed to the order, but defended it in principle. Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a former undercover C.I.A. officer, called the measure \u201cthe ultimate display of mistrust\u201d that would \u201cerode our allies\u2019 willingness to fight with us\u201d and put Americans at risk.\n\nA handful of other Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, also offered criticism, though more cautious, on Saturday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that the United States did not make policy based on religion, though his criticism was muted compared with his colleagues\u2019.\n\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan released a statement on Friday praising the order, but his aides repeatedly declined requests for further comment.\n\nMr. McConnell cautioned against vilifying Muslims who are key allies in the American war on terror. The country, he said, needed to \u201cbe careful\u201d with how the order is carried out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be careful. We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d\n\nAs tensions mount, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will be debated on Capitol Hill this week. Democrats pledged on Sunday to introduce legislation undoing them and limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s executive authority. And the measure could add pressure to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to lead the Justice and State Departments, who will probably be asked to offer their positions on the ban.\n\nSome Republicans compared the order to a measure that overwhelmingly passed the House in 2015 not long after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris. But that bill was far less broad than Mr. Trump\u2019s order, focusing narrowly on the screening process for Syrians and Iraqis who entered the United States as refugees. That bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate, who argued that it too closely mirrored Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign talk of a Muslim ban, and congressional Republicans largely put off the issue during the rest of the campaign.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order, which was enacted on Friday, halted the entry into the United States of all refugees for 120 days, barred the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspended for 90 days the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 all predominantly Muslim countries. It prompted chaos across the globe as the United States\u2019 borders were sealed off to the affected groups and the Department of Homeland Security rushed to apply uneven enforcement. By Saturday night, judges in at least two states had issued stays preventing the government from deporting certain arrivals caught in the rollout of the order.\n\nDemocrats were nearly united in their condemnation of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, with several of them rushing to airports to speak out in defense of people who had been detained and even those representing states that Mr. Trump won voicing dissent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse the action on Sunday, saying it made the country \u201cless humanitarian, less safe, less American.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be reversed immediately, and Democrats are going to introduce legislation to overturn it,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters gathered for a news conference in New York.\n\nRepublicans who spoke out were more measured, directing their criticism at the planning for the policy and its carrying out, though their disagreement with Mr. Trump was still clear. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, wrote on the website Medium that the president \u201cand his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.\u201d\n\nMr. Sasse said Mr. Trump was right to focus on border security but disagreed with how he was carrying out the policy.\n\nAnd Representative Barbara Comstock, a Republican whose Northern Virginia district includes a large Muslim population, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s action had gone \u201cbeyond the increased vetting actions the Congress has supported.\u201d", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["republican", "mr", "trump", "gop", "supported", "security", "growing", "refugee", "united", "states", "trumps", "number", "lawmakers", "senator", "order", "criticize", "policy"], "summary": "The Republican leadership \u2014 and senior members of the House \u2014 have either supported Mr. Trump or been largely silent about the order.\nWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201dAs tensions mount, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will be debated on Capitol Hill this week.\nDemocrats pledged on Sunday to introduce legislation undoing them and limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s executive authority.\nBut that bill was far less broad than Mr. Trump\u2019s order, focusing narrowly on the screening process for Syrians and Iraqis who entered the United States as refugees.\nRepublicans who spoke out were more measured, directing their criticism at the planning for the policy and its carrying out, though their disagreement with Mr. Trump was still clear."}
