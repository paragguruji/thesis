There have been 123 such murders since the 9/11 attacks \u2014 and 230,000 other murders.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast year Americans were less likely to be killed by Muslim terrorists than for being Muslim, according to Charles Kurzman of the University of North Carolina. The former is a risk of approximately one in six million; the latter, one in one million.\n\nThe bottom line is that most years in the U.S., ladders kill far more Americans than Muslim terrorists do. Same with bathtubs. Ditto for stairs. And lightning.\n\nAbove all, fear spouses: Husbands are incomparably more deadly in America than jihadist terrorists.\n\nAnd husbands are so deadly in part because in America they have ready access to firearms, even when they have a history of violence. In other countries, brutish husbands put wives in hospitals; in America, they put them in graves.\n\nYet Trump is raging about a risk from refugees that seems manageable, even as he talks about relaxing rules on another threat, guns, that is infinitely more lethal.\n\n\u201cI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools,\u201d Trump said last year. \u201cMy first day, it gets signed, O.K., my first day.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t in fact signed such an order, but his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, backed him up at her confirmation hearing last month, saying that guns might be necessary in schools because of \u201cpotential grizzlies.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Sebastian Gorka, a White House aide to Trump, who wrote a book in which he suggested that Americans engage in their own private counterterrorism strategy: \u201cConsider applying for a concealed-carry permit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne reason to think that this isn\u2019t great advice: Gorka was arrested at Reagan Airport in Washington last year for trying to bring a gun through security. This didn\u2019t prevent him from getting a White House job.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Nicholas Kristof Newsletter Receive emails about each column and other occasional commentary.

Likewise, there is a strong push in Congress \u2014 backed by Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son \u2014 to end longstanding curbs on the purchase of silencers. The younger Trump and other advocates say that silencers would reduce the danger of hearing loss from gunfire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hearing protection,\u201d Donald Jr. explained in a video for SilencerCo, a Utah company that makes silencers. \u201cIt\u2019s a health issue, frankly.\u201d He expressed admiration for silencer technology and frustration that \u201cI don\u2019t get to use it in the People\u2019s Republic of New York.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that we don\u2019t have much evidence on the impact of silencers (partly because the gun lobby tries to block research on gun safety). But the sale of silencers has been restricted nationally since the 1930s because of fears that they help criminals avoid attention after shootings, and the National Rifle Association\u2019s battle for them seems to be rooted in its broader campaign to eviscerate gun laws.\n\nThe evidence does suggest that if we really want to make Americans safer, then we should require universal background checks before gun purchases (22 percent of guns are purchased without background checks). We should work hard to get guns out of the hands of people subject to domestic violence restraining orders, or people with recent histories of crime or alcohol or drug abuse.\n\nWe should also require trigger locks or safe storage of guns, especially in houses with young children. We should crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchasers.\n\nSo let\u2019s not be diverted by shiny things and furious tweets. With his travel ban, Trump is peddling an ineffective policy that is morally repugnant, even as he marches toward a looser policy on guns likely to result in more school shootings, more shattered families and more lives lost.\n\nThose graves will last long after Trump\u2019s tweets are gone.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn other news, I\u2019m delighted to announce that the winner of my 2017 win-a-trip contest is Aneri Pattani, a senior at Northeastern University and an ace student journalist. We will probably report together on global poverty issues in West Africa in June, focusing on Liberia, with a separate trip looking at America\u2019s own poverty. Congrats to Aneri and a special thanks to the Center for Global Development for helping sift through hundreds of applications.", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "authors": "Nicholas Kristof", "type": "article"}
