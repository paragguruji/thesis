{"title": "Liberal Lawyers Plan Wave of Resistance to Trump Policies", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/lawyers-trump-travel-order.html?mcubz=0", "text": "The effort was primarily drafted by lawyers at the project and at the National Immigration Law Center, and by law students at Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic overseen by Profs. Michael J. Wishnie and Muneer I. Ahmad. Then it was argued at an emergency hearing by an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.\n\nVideo\n\nThe effort illustrates that a broad mobilization of rights-oriented lawyers is emerging.\n\nDetermined to make legal resistance one of the defining attributes of the Trump era, lawyers at liberal advocacy groups have been putting aside institutional rivalries and organizing to work together on litigation.\n\nSeveral leaders of the effort said their hope is that the judiciary may serve as a strong check to a government controlled by Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress across a broad range of anticipated fights.\n\nFor example, in early January, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law convened a private meeting of about two dozen civil rights groups to strategize about coming voting rights and other civil rights fights, participants said. And last week, the American Constitution Society and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund co-sponsored a similar two-day private conference to discuss coordination of legal challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly in a moment in which civil rights organizations face unprecedented challenges and will need to mount new and more aggressive strategies,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee.\n\nNow, with the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn \u2014 which was quickly echoed elsewhere, including one filed in Virginia by two other veterans of the Yale immigration clinic \u2014 the leading edge of that wave is arriving. (The litigation joins a lawsuit filed last week arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s ownership of businesses that take payments from foreign governments violates the Constitution.)\n\nPropelling the effort is an outpouring of financial support and volunteers that legal rights group leaders say dwarfs the campaign that gradually emerged to counter the George W. Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 national security policies, including detention without trial at the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen it at this intensity and across all these different issues \u2014 freedom of speech, Muslim rights, immigrants\u2019 rights, abortion rights,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. \u201cAll the pots have been put on a boil.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe A.C.L.U.\u2019s membership rolls and fund-raising provide a measure of those energies. Mr. Romero said his group last year had about 400,000 members \u2014 to be active, people must give at least $20 each year \u2014 down from its peak of about 550,000 during the Bush administration. In each of the past three years, its website took in about $5 million in donations, he said.\n\nBut just since Election Day, he said, the A.C.L.U. has surged to more than a million members and \u2014 as of 5 p.m. Monday \u2014 it had taken in $71.3 million from 921,304 online donations; $31.5 million of that came from 456,714 since Friday, when Mr. Trump signed the travel ban. The money will fund many more lawyers at both the federal and state level, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary \u2014 we\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cIt means that people expect us to do a lot more of this work.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Caroline Fredrickson, the executive director of the American Constitution Society, said that when her organization sponsors a conference call to discuss an issue, it typically gets 80 to 100 R.S.V.P.s. On Monday, it announced a call about the travel ban and got 500, she said.\n\nSimilarly, Nan Aron, the president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, which focuses on judicial nominations, said in the past her group has had trouble getting support from corporate law firms that seek to avoid entanglement in politics, but since the election, several \u201cmajor\u201d ones \u2014 she would not name them \u2014 have volunteered their services to research the backgrounds and records of potential judicial nominees.\n\n\u201cThe bar has been galvanized in a way I have not seen since the 1960s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just showering us with offers of legal assistance.\u201d\n\nNew liberal legal groups are also sprouting up. The day after the election, Traci Feit Love, an Atlanta-based lawyer, created a private Facebook group she called Lawyers for Good Government, hoping, she said, to get about 200 members who wanted to discuss the changes that were coming.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

Her group has since helped organize the \u201cRise Above\u201d conference in Washington, as part of the post-inauguration Women\u2019s March and helped steer volunteer lawyers to airports after Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to supplant other organizations \u2014 we\u2019re looking to complement them,\u201d Ms. Love said.\n\nMany immigrant legal advocacy groups were also steering volunteer lawyers to airports, and over the weekend at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, the number of volunteer lawyers at times exceeded the number of protesters. By Sunday, the volunteers had set up a makeshift legal clinic on a folding table under a bank of escalators and began to organize themselves, starting a WhatsApp group to share information and a Google spreadsheet to track potential cases.\n\nAmber D. Murray, 34, an immigration attorney who works with No One Left Behind, which helps resettle Iraqi and Afghan refugees who worked for the military, was at Dulles around 6:30 p.m. Sunday when she got a call from an Afghan man whose flight had just landed.\n\nThe man had a special visa that is given to those who have worked for the United States military or government, and was arriving with his wife and children.\n\n\u201cIf you get pulled aside, give them my name, give them my phone number and tell them I\u2019m your lawyer,\u201d Ms. Murray told him.\n\nThen the waiting began. After hours to clear customs, her clients made it out.", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Charlie Savage", "type": "article"}
