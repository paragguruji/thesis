The order, which temporarily bans travel for citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspends the resettlement of refugees to the U.S., runs against America\u2019s proud history of giving shelter to the vulnerable, Jolie argues. Not only does the ban deny entry to those who most need help from the U.S. and who, she points out, are subject to the very highest degree of screening of any traveler to the U.S., but it also threatens to further perpetuate international instability and violence. For the sake of America\u2019s own safety, as well as for the safety of refugees fleeing conflict zones, Jolie argues U.S. officials must continue to uphold the United Nations convention and standards by welcoming even a small portion of refugees to the nation\u2019s shores.\n\nJolie has long championed the rights of women and children refugees displaced by war. Speaking at the 2015 Women in the World New York Summit, Jolie shared harrowing images of the horrors she\u2019s seen firsthand as Special Envoy of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
