But Ms. Mastropietro is loath to give her employees false hope.\n\n\u201cThey all know we\u2019re talking about layoffs,\u201d she said.\n\nHer staff members went back to work, back to assisting the refugees waiting in the lobby, clutching foreign-language paperwork. But they struggled to concentrate, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to upend their mission, with the president effectively suggesting that they are abetting \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people.\u201d\n\nHere was Josh Digrugilliers, 26, a Church World Service housing specialist. Just two months ago, a visit to Lancaster found him preparing a slate-gray house on a hillside for the imminent arrival of another Syrian family, this one with six members. He had shopped at Walmart for last-minute household necessities, using money from the one-time government grant of $1,000 or so that each refugee receives.\n\nNow he was setting up a modest apartment for an incoming Haitian couple, but thinking about all those he knew who were hoping to be joined someday by relatives left behind.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou were rooting for them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they just lost a very big bet.\u201d\n\nHere was Gaby Garver, 22, a case manager who, two months ago, shopped for food and stocked the cabinets of that gray house.

Two months ago, Mr. Alfayadh collected that grateful family of Syrians at the airport and drove them to their new home.\n\nThe night of the executive order, Mr. Alfayadh had a nightmare about immigration officials coming to arrest him.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a citizen!\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn around.\u201d\n\nNow Mr. Alfayadh was returning to that house on the hillside to visit the Syrian family he and his colleagues had resettled: Ahmad and Fatima Mohamed Zein, 53 and 50, and four of their children: Somaya, 32; Mona, 19; Yousef, 13; and Aya, 10.", "authors": ["Dan Barry", "This Land"], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["syrian", "upended", "family", "ago", "pen", "visit", "mission", "resettlement", "york", "months", "sign", "sweep", "alfayadh", "house", "presidents", "mr"], "summary": "Her staff members went back to work, back to assisting the refugees waiting in the lobby, clutching foreign-language paperwork.\nJust two months ago, a visit to Lancaster found him preparing a slate-gray house on a hillside for the imminent arrival of another Syrian family, this one with six members.\n\u201cAnd they just lost a very big bet.\u201dHere was Gaby Garver, 22, a case manager who, two months ago, shopped for food and stocked the cabinets of that gray house.\nTwo months ago, Mr. Alfayadh collected that grateful family of Syrians at the airport and drove them to their new home.\nThe night of the executive order, Mr. Alfayadh had a nightmare about immigration officials coming to arrest him."}
