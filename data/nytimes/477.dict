She is on Twitter.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s suggestions during his campaign to ban Muslims from entering the country and to possibly establish a registry of Muslims have stirred fears about religious discrimination.\n\nBut a more easily realized and less publicized proposal by Donald J. Trump may also threaten civil liberties. That is a Commission on Radical Islam, which his campaign website says would \u201cidentify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization.\u201d As hate crimes against American Muslims soar, such a commission could further incite distrust and undermine Muslim leaders and civil society.\n\nPresidents Obama and George W. Bush were careful to avoid tarring all Muslims with the terrorism brush. Six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush visited a mosque to warn against the harassment of American Muslims and underline the need to respect Islam. Mr. Obama has sent the same message, refusing to even use the term \u201cradical Islam.\u201d This does not mean that the United States government has simply ignored the belief systems of terrorists. To the contrary, there are reams of research and several congressional reports on the topic. It seems unlikely that a Commission on Radical Islam would add anything.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s commission would be charged with identifying \u201cwarning signs of radicalization,\u201d allowing it to veer easily into examining political and religious views. Both the New York Police Department and the F.B.I. have said that indicators of terrorism included political activism and signs of Muslim religiosity, such as growing a beard, wearing a head scarf or giving up smoking and drinking. Although these ideas have been thoroughly debunked by research, they continue to be influential and could serve as a basis for categorizing tens of thousands of American Muslims as potential terrorists requiring monitoring by law enforcement (or worse).\n\nResearch has also found little evidence of support for terrorism among American Muslims. James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., said, \u201cThe threat here focuses primarily on troubled souls in America who are being inspired or enabled online to do something violent.\u201d This makes the proposed commission\u2019s mandate of ferreting out networks that support radicalization sound like a witch hunt that could ensnare politically active American Muslims and the civil society groups that work to protect the community\u2019s rights.\n\nThat seems to be what Newt Gingrich, one of the president-elect\u2019s top advisers, has in mind. Earlier this year, Mr. Gingrich called for a new House Un-American Activities Committee to deal with \u201cIslamic supremacists.\u201d That notorious committee\u2019s hearings and the investigations by Senator Joseph McCarthy into suspected Communists represented some of the most severe political repression in American history and destroyed lives. Today, as falsehoods are spread quickly on the internet and accepted as true, this risk may be even more acute.\n\nThese fears are not theoretical. Conspiracy theorists and pseudo-experts poised to peddle lies about prominent Muslim officials and groups have garnered support in both Congress and Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nIn 2012, five members of Congress asked the State Department\u2019s inspector general to investigate the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood on the department, citing family ties of Huma Abedin, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest aide. (The alleged connections were so convoluted that that they inspired a \u201cDaily Show\u201d sketch.) This summer, Senator Ted Cruz held a hearing in which a witness smeared the Islamic Society of North America, an umbrella organization for Muslim groups, claiming it had links to terrorist groups. The same witness also insinuated that the two Muslim members of the House of Representatives, Keith Ellison and Andre Carson, supported terrorism because they attended the group\u2019s events, as had the Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson.\n\nThe F.B.I. has a policy of marginalizing the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights organization. The F.B.I.\u2019s stance, which it claims is based on vague concerns over potential connections to terrorism, is difficult to understand given the bureau\u2019s broad powers to seize the assets of any organization supporting terrorism. So unfounded is the F.B.I.\u2019s stance that it has been resisted by its own field offices and the Justice Department, and the council is a frequent partner of local police departments and other agencies.\n\nBaseless insinuations about Muslim groups and individuals are a regular feature on Breitbart, the website run by Stephen Bannon, chief strategist to the incoming president.\n\nLike many campaign promises, Mr. Trump\u2019s commission may never become reality. But it would be far harder to challenge in court than a Muslim ban or registry. It must be vigorously resisted as a threat not only to American Muslims, but all Americans who dread a return to McCarthyism.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "publish_date": "2016-11-18", "title": "A 'Commission on Radical Islam' Could Lead to a New McCarthy Era"}
