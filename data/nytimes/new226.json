Greenberg Immigration Justice Clinic at Cardozo Law School and the Center for Constitutional Rights said in a complaint filed late Monday.\n\nThe complaint was redacted to protect the names of people caught up in the disruption. It included 26 accounts by lawyers barred from reaching their clients and in some cases by affected individuals or their relatives.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Kelly rejected accusations that inspectors had insulted or mistreated those caught up in the confusion after Mr. Trump signed the order.\n\n\u201cEveryone was treated humanely,\u201d Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general recently confirmed as homeland security secretary, told lawmakers. \u201cWe did have to step back and kind of re-cock in that first 24-hour period because of action by one of the federal courts. That changed things a bit, so we had to kind of step back.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly said he also agreed with a Twitter post by Mr. Trump that dangerous people could be getting into the country while a court order has held up the ban. He said it was \u201centirely possible\u201d and it was likely that law enforcement officials would not know \u201cuntil the boom.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he was concerned about \u201cthe lack of coordination, both within the executive branch and also with congressional leaders like myself.\u201d\n\nBut he said he applauded Mr. Kelly for \u201cquickly correcting what I consider to be errors by quickly granting the exception and waiver to green-card holders, which went a long way to remedy, I think, this executive order.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kelly said most of the confusion had occurred because of the multiple court rulings issued in response to the order and the many protesters who appeared at airports across the country, not because of the actions of Customs and Border Protection officers.\n\nRepresentative Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said he agreed that there had been problems with the rollout of the ban. But he rejected Mr. Kelly\u2019s testimony that the order had not caused chaos at airports as customs officers tried to determine who would be denied entry.\n\n\u201cThey were put in an untenable position. Basically, they were flying by the seat of their pants trying to interpret an E.O. that had no directives to go with it,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, referring to the executive order. \u201cYou had L.A. doing one thing, Atlanta doing one thing and J.F.K. doing another. So I\u2019m troubled by the comment that he made that there was no chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson said he and other members of Congress had requested copies of the guidance that United States Customs and Border Protection sent to its officers after the immigration order was signed, but had not received the information so far. \u201cOur feeling is that the normal vetting that goes with the issuance of an E.O. was not done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive order has been criticized by several former high-ranking diplomatic and security officials \u2014 among them former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Leon E. Panetta, the former secretary of defense and C.I.A. director, whom Mr. Kelly worked for at the Pentagon \u2014 who said there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for the travel ban.\n\nAccording to the report by the legal advocacy groups, the niece of a detained Iranian described how he was not given food for 18 hours and then was physically carried to a plane headed back to Dubai. A Sudanese doctor in the middle of her residency in Cleveland told how her passport had been confiscated while she was detained and not returned until she had been deported to Saudi Arabia, the country she had flown in from.\n\nOver and over, lawyers said they had been unable to reach their clients. The report complained that border agents had \u201cmaintained an impenetrable wall between these detained individuals and lawyers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to prevent similar rights violations from occurring in the future, we recommend that the Office of Inspector General develop mechanisms to ensure that individuals detained in airports can communicate with legal counsel,\u201d the report said.", "authors": ["Ron Nixon", "Nicholas Kulish"], "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "homeland", "ban", "detained", "security", "admits", "secretary", "chief", "rushed", "individuals", "rights", "kelly", "thompson", "order", "mr"], "summary": "In his testimony, Mr. Kelly rejected accusations that inspectors had insulted or mistreated those caught up in the confusion after Mr. Trump signed the order.\n\u201cEveryone was treated humanely,\u201d Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general recently confirmed as homeland security secretary, told lawmakers.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the rollout of the executive order had been problematic.\nthat had no directives to go with it,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, referring to the executive order.\ndirector, whom Mr. Kelly worked for at the Pentagon \u2014 who said there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for the travel ban."}
