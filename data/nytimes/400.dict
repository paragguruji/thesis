They said the president\u2019s powers to limit immigration \u201care undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the opinion also signaled that some of the justices might believe that Mr. Trump exceeded even that broad authority when he twice sought to impose a blanket ban on entry to the United States from certain predominantly Muslim countries. With the limits imposed on Monday by the court, the travel ban will be far narrower than the one he proposed in his first week in office and a later, revised version.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the opinion was a rare legal victory after months in which the lower courts repeatedly chastised him for imposing a de facto ban on Muslims\u2019 entering the country. In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., said the president\u2019s revised order \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the court opinion would allow the department \u201cto largely implement the President\u2019s executive order.\u201d Mr. Trump used similar language in his statement, saying his travel ban would now \u201cbecome largely effective.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics of the ban disputed those assessments. Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the opinion meant that the ban would not apply to many people while the court case proceeds.\n\n\u201cClearly, the White House press statement today is based on alternative facts,\u201d Ms. Wang said.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision could lead to months of administrative and legal wrangling as consular officials try to determine which people are allowed to seek entry into the United States and which are barred by the opinion.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWe are going to be monitoring all of that,\u201d said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nThe justices said the distinction should be easy to administer. \u201cIn practical terms, this means that\u201d the executive order \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut Justice Clarence Thomas, who issued a partial dissent on Monday that was joined by Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, warned that the court\u2019s opinion would \u201cprove unworkable\u201d for officials at consulates around the world and would invite \u201ca flood of litigation\u201d from people denied entry.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote.\n\nBased on the dissent, those three justices are likely to vote in favor of the Trump administration.\n\nThe court\u2019s four-member liberal bloc \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 are likely to vote against it.\n\nThat leaves the ultimate fate of the ban in the hands of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions called the court\u2019s decision an \u201cimportant step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government,\u201d and he expressed confidence that the court would uphold the president\u2019s travel ban in its entirety after it heard the case this fall.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The time was needed, the order said, to address gaps in the government\u2019s screening and vetting procedures.\n\n\n\nTwo federal appeals courts had blocked critical parts of the order, and the administration had asked that the lower court rulings be stayed while the case moved forward. The Supreme Court granted part of that request in its unsigned opinion.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit ruled on constitutional grounds, saying the limits on travel from the six countries violated the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion. It blocked those limits, but not the suspension of the refugee program.\n\nThis month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked both the limits on travel and the suspension of the refugee program. It ruled on statutory rather than constitutional grounds, saying Mr. Trump had exceeded the authority granted him by Congress.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to review both cases in October, noting that the government had not asked it to act faster.\n\nThe court suggested that the administration could complete its internal reviews over the summer, raising the prospect that the case could be moot by the time it is argued.", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": "Michael D.
