Frosh, the Maryland attorney general, said if the lawsuit progressed to the discovery phase, he and Karl Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, would seek to obtain the president\u2019s tax returns to gauge the extent of his business dealings.\n\n\u201cIt is unprecedented that the American people must question day after day whether decisions are made and actions are taken to benefit the United States or to benefit Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s conflicts of interest threaten our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department had no immediate response. But in a brief filed last week in response to the New York case, the department argued that the earlier suit should be dismissed because the emoluments clauses were never intended to prohibit a president from owning a business while in office. Even if the president had violated those prohibitions, the department\u2019s lawyers contended, it is up to Congress, not a federal judge, to act. They also argued that the plaintiffs had shown no financial harm.\n\nIn a statement, the Republican National Committee called the new lawsuit \u201cabsurd.\u201d Lindsay Jancek, a spokeswoman, said, \u201cThe actions by the attorneys general represent the kind of partisan grandstanding voters across the country have come to despise.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s complaint claims that businesses owned by Mr. Trump divert customers away from businesses that the District of Columbia and Maryland either own, license or tax, harming those governments financially. For example, it contends, the Trump International Hotel in Washington competes with facilities owned or operated by the city\u2019s government, including the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, its armory and its Carnegie Library. It also competes with a government-owned conference center in Bethesda, Md., and a resort in Prince George\u2019s County, Md., that generates tax revenue for the state, the suit claims.\n\nMr. Racine told reporters on Monday that just as states intervened to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit travel from predominantly Muslim countries, he hoped to force the court to step in and evaluate Mr. Trump\u2019s business entanglements.\n\n\u201cCongress has given the president a total pass,\u201d he said. \u201cState attorney generals are serving as a necessary check and balance in the Trump era where others failed.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

His visits to the Trump hotel have raised the business\u2019s profile, the suit claims, and put competitors at a disadvantage. Although Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses pay taxes, it states that over all, his business interests threaten revenue on which Maryland and the District of Columbia depend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, the suit claims, the president\u2019s business dealings create an \u201cintolerable dilemma\u201d for governments like Maryland and the District of Columbia. If they refuse requests from the Trump Organization for concessions because they are too costly or against the public interest, the company could turn to states more willing to grant favors.\n\nThe Justice Department argues the emoluments clauses should be narrowly construed to prohibit the president from accepting gifts or payments in his official capacity. It does not extend to ordinary commercial arms-length transactions like hotel stays, the department contends. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders claim he has taken every reasonable step to distance himself from the Trump Organization, the family company now run by his adult sons.\n\nZachary Clopton, a law professor at Cornell University, said Monday\u2019s lawsuit may be more serious than the New York complaint because Maryland is legally considered a \u201ccoequal sovereign\u201d with the president and so is a stronger opponent.\n\nAndy S. Grewal, a University of Iowa law professor who has criticized the merits of the New York case, said he remained skeptical of the legal arguments in both lawsuits. But he said: \u201cAll they really need is for a court to say Donald Trump needs to release his records to you. That would be one heck of a victory for them.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys general\u2019s complaint \u201crepresents an important new front in the emoluments war,\u201d said Norman Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, whose lawyers are outside counsel in the case. The group is also the original plaintiff in the New York lawsuit.", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "authors": "Sharon LaFraniere", "type": "article"}
