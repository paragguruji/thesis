This is incorrect; existing law already places strong emphasis on religious persecution among the criteria for resettlement. For example, most of the refugees from Iran \u2014 a Muslim-majority country \u2014 who are resettled by my organization are not Muslim.\n\nCompared with other types of immigrants, refugees are the most thoroughly vetted group to enter the United States. The resettlement process can take up to 36 months and involves screenings by the Department of Homeland Security, the F.B.I., the Department of Defense, the State Department and the National Counterterrorism Center and United States intelligence community. According to the Cato Institute, the chances that a citizen here will be killed by a refugee are one in 3.64 billion a year; an American is far more likely to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist attack carried out by a refugee.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

And this is true not just on the coasts but across the country. In the 29 cities where the Rescue Committee has resettlement offices, elected officials like the mayor of Boise, Idaho, and the governor of Utah, along with police officers, school principals, faith leaders and small-business owners, actively welcome refugees. They do so out of a sense of a moral obligation, of course, but also because they have witnessed the myriad ways refugees have enriched their communities over the years.\n\nTo take one example, over the course of a decade, refugees created at least 38 new businesses in the Cleveland area alone. In turn, these businesses created an additional 175 jobs, and in 2012 provided a $12 million stimulus to the local economy.\n\nThere is a further concern raised by the president\u2019s refugee ban. When the United States abjures its responsibility to the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, it forgoes its moral authority to call upon the countries of Europe, as well as poorer nations like Lebanon, Turkey, Kenya and Pakistan, which host over five million refugees among them, to provide such shelter.\n\nHistorically, the United States has welcomed the \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free,\u201d and this has helped cement America\u2019s leadership of the international order. But why should others continue to bear their heavy burdens when the United States won\u2019t? Support for refugees is not charity; it is a contribution to the global stability on which all nations depend \u2014 and this is especially important at a time when the world faces a heightened threat of terrorism.\n\nTerrorists are strategic in their work and their messaging. The civilized world must be equally strategic in its response. Where extremists seek to foster a clash of civilizations, democratic governments should not play into their hands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is what a ban on specific nationalities does. It is not right, it is not needed and it is not smart.\n\nIn 1980, when Congress passed the Refugee Act with bipartisan support, President Carter\u2019s secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the refugee issue required the United States to \u201creveal to the world \u2014 and more important to ourselves \u2014 whether we truly live by our ideals or simply carve them on our monuments.\u201d\n\nThat still resonates today. Expert review of the resettlement vetting process is part of good government. Hasty dismissal of carefully developed systems is harmful in and of itself. It is also a distressing departure from fact-based policy making.\n\nThe world looks to America for enlightened leadership. Its citizens seek the same from their government. Refugee policy is a telling test for every nation. The United States passed that test for so many years, so it is a tragedy for it now to fail when its commitment is needed more than ever.", "publish_date": "2017-01-27", "authors": "David Miliband", "type": "article"}
