But few episodes have so blindsided the current generation of Iraqi soldiers, who are accustomed to viewing the United States as their partner in a shared struggle to defeat insurgents and build a viable nation.\n\nThe timing of the order hit the Iraqi military in Mosul like an incoming rocket. Iraqi forces have reached a pivotal moment, seizing half of Mosul and preparing to assault the remaining half \u2014 supported by American advisers, Special Operations forces and airstrikes by the United States-led coalition.\n\nWhy, some soldiers asked, had Mr. Trump chosen this moment to lump together all Iraqis as mortal threats to America \u2014 soldiers, civilians and terrorists alike?\n\n\u201cThis decision by Trump blows up our liberation efforts of cooperation and coordination with American forces,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Mizhir Khalid al-Mashhadani, a counterterrorism force commander in Mosul.\n\nAstounded by the announcement, General Mashhadani, who speaks English, said he asked his American counterparts about the president\u2019s order. He said several told him they considered the decision hasty and its consequences poorly considered.\n\nThe travel ban was all the more perplexing to those Iraqi troops who had heard Mr. Trump vow as a candidate to wipe out the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Some also heard the president promise, when issuing the order, to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the United States.\n\nFor some soldiers, those comments seemed to equate Iraqi soldiers \u2014 by virtue of their nationality and religion \u2014 with the very terrorists they were fighting.\n\nPhoto\n\nPresident Trump was \u201cunjust and not right,\u201d said Maj. Sabah al-Aloosi, 37, another counterterrorism force officer in Mosul. It is Iraqi soldiers, he said, \u201cwho are fighting terrorism on behalf of the world and sacrificing themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCol. John L. Dorrian, the spokesman in Baghdad for the American-led operation against the Islamic State, emphasized that the president\u2019s order was temporary, calling it \u201ca pause.\u201d\n\nTold of critical comments by Iraqi soldiers and officers, Colonel Dorrian said: \u201cFor our part, we continue to do every single day what we\u2019ve been doing all along in the campaign to defeat Daesh.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The ban on so-called S.I.V. holders was lifted after the Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt Iraqis who have tangibly demonstrated their commitment to supporting United States forces, a Pentagon spokesman said.\n\nBut Iraqis who hold valid refugee visas, some because their association with Americans exposes them to danger in Iraq, remained barred from entry to the United States.\n\nBefore the Jan. 27 ban was announced, two counterterrorism force officers in Mosul said they had begun making plans to visit the United States after the battle for Iraq\u2019s second-largest city.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCaptain Musawe, who had hoped to vacation in the United States, said he was not making any travel plans at the moment. \u201cThe decision by Trump has wasted my dreams,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor Aloosi said he even asked his American counterparts for advice about the visa process for Iraqi soldiers seeking to visit the \u201cwonderful sights and tourism\u201d he had seen on American TV programs. \u201cBut all that has vaporized because of the decision by Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nGeneral Mashhadani said that despite bitter feelings among many of the soldiers he commands, he continues to work closely, if under trying circumstances, with his American counterparts.\n\n\u201cMy American friends who are officers promised to let me in their country in case I decide to go there \u2014 even if they have to use illegal ways,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["David Zucchino"], "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "iraqi", "trump", "counterterrorism", "ban", "iraqis", "order", "united", "drives", "soldiers", "wedge", "states", "americans", "american", "forces"], "summary": "\u201cThis decision by Trump blows up our liberation efforts of cooperation and coordination with American forces,\u201d said Brig.\nSome also heard the president promise, when issuing the order, to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the United States.\nFor some soldiers, those comments seemed to equate Iraqi soldiers \u2014 by virtue of their nationality and religion \u2014 with the very terrorists they were fighting.\nThe interpreters and their families had been issued special immigrant visas because of their service to the United States.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyCaptain Musawe, who had hoped to vacation in the United States, said he was not making any travel plans at the moment."}
