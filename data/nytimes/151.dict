{"title": "In Trump\u2019s Early Days, News Media Finds Competing Narratives", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/business/trump-news-media.html?mcubz=0", "text": "He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point.\n\nSome of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s guests were also critical. Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that \u201cthe controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him.\u201d Brit Hume said it was handled \u201cvery clumsily.\u201d And Charles Krauthammer said it was introduced in the \u201cmost amateurish, botched way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, in more typical form, Mr. O\u2019Reilly also focused on what he said he perceived to be Mr. Trump\u2019s political calculation, adding that much of the country was \u201cgetting fed up with the anti-Trump people.\u201d\n\nBy late Monday, order on Fox News had been fully restored. In his opening monologue, Sean Hannity followed a familiar trope, criticizing the mainstream news media for \u201cfreaking out and completely misrepresenting\u201d the immigration ban. The Trump administration, he said, was trying to \u201cset the record straight, but the media won\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nUnrest at The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, part of the Rupert Murdoch-controlled News Corporation, delivered a scathing editorial on Monday denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cblunderbuss\u201d policy. But on Tuesday, some journalists at the publication were frustrated after a note from the editor in chief, Gerard Baker, instructed editors to avoid the phrase \u201cseven majority Muslim countries\u201d when writing about the order.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very loaded,\u201d Mr. Baker wrote Monday night in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times (and reported earlier by BuzzFeed). \u201cThe reason they\u2019ve been chosen is not because they\u2019re majority Muslim but because they\u2019re on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern. Would be less loaded to say \u2018seven countries the U.S. has designated as being states that pose significant or elevated risks of terrorism.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe note caused concern among some editors and reporters in the newsroom as inappropriate interference.\n\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said Mr. Baker\u2019s note was \u201cpart of a larger conversation discussing late-breaking developments as a story was being edited on deadline.\u201d In the same email chain, she said, Mr. Baker also pushed to include more comments from critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Baker has maintained that the publication is committed to fair reporting.\n\nElsewhere in the news and entertainment empire of the Murdoch family, there was a more pointed response to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a memo to employees of 21st Century Fox on Monday evening, James and Lachlan Murdoch suggested they did not fully support Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201c21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U.S., founded by \u2014 and comprising at all levels of the business \u2014 immigrants,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of America\u2019s strength.\u201d\n\nPlenty of Support Online\n\nAmong far-right organizations, the tone in the last few days has been predictably defiant and jubilant, reflecting their position on the conservative spectrum. Several seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation that Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had shed \u201cfake tears\u201d over the ban. The Federalist, a right-leaning web magazine, published an article under the headline, \u201cNo, Trump\u2019s Immigration Order Isn\u2019t Racist or Reminiscent of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump fired Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, on Monday night for refusing to carry out his immigration order, Breitbart News went with the spirited headline, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired: Trump Fires AG for \u2018Betrayal.\u2019\u201d The conservative Daily Caller called Ms. Yates\u2019s decision a \u201cbrazen act of defiance that cost her the post.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Breitbart readers may have been surprised to see the site covering protests \u2014 but the blaring headline would have quickly showed the organization\u2019s focus. \u201cTrump Supporter Knocked Unconscious at Portland Airport Protest,\u201d the site wrote.", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Sydney Ember", "type": "article"}
