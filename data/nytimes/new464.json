Haines, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview. She said they wanted to focus the law on catching foreign fighters who might have visited those countries.\n\nWhile the State Department designates all seven countries as terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism, the United States receives more visitors from other nations linked to terrorism.\n\nVisitors to the United States from terrorist safe havens or sponsors of terrorism, 2015\n\nThe vast majority of people who have carried out deadly jihadist-inspired attacks in the United States were citizens of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Egypt and Lebanon.

In fiscal year 2011, 9,388 Iraqi refugees were admitted to the United States, according to the State Department.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order bars all refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nIraqi refugees arriving in the United States\n\n20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 FY 2007 2009 2011 2013 2016 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 FY 2007 2009 2011 2013 2016\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement on Facebook, Jan. 29\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\nWhat really happened\n\nAfter he signed the order, Mr. Trump said that Christians would be given priority once the United States resumed taking in refugees.\n\nMr. Trump has said that the travel ban does not target Muslims, noting there are more than 40 majority-Muslim countries worldwide that are not affected.\n\nMuslim-majority countries\n\nBANNED COUNTRIES BANNED COUNTRIES BANNED COUNTRIES\n\nBut Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that Christians would be given priority once the United States resumed taking in refugees.\n\nThe White House has said Mr. Trump simply wants to give preference to persecuted minorities. And in majority-Muslim countries, Christians are often religious minorities.\n\nDuring the campaign Mr. Trump framed the plan as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. He also recently described the executive order as a \u201cban.\u201d\n\nSome religious leaders think that is still his intent.\n\n\u201cIs the intent of the ban religious? Without a hesitation,\u201d said Omid Safi, the director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center. \u201cThis is not something I\u2019m having to read between the lines.\u201d\n\nNot only are the seven countries in the ban majority Muslim, all are almost completely Muslim.\n\nShare of Muslims in each banned country\n\n10% 50% 90% Iran Yemen Iraq Somalia Sudan Libya Syria 10% 50% 90% Iran Yemen Iraq Somalia Sudan Libya Syria\n\n\u201cWe need to stand up against anything that pits Christians and Muslims against each other,\u201d said Jen Smyers, the associate director for immigration and refugee policy at Church World Service, a ministry affiliated with dozens of Christian denominations.\n\nReligious leaders, both Muslim and Christian, said that temporarily suspending the refugee program and barring Syrian refugees indefinitely shut the door to the most vulnerable people.
