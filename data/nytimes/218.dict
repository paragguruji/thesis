In particular, he zeroed in on one detail among a few paragraphs of the story that he insisted were wrong: that the president has worn a bathrobe while alone in the White House residence.\n\n\u201cThat is literally the epitome of fake news,\u201d Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump. \u201cStart at the top. I don\u2019t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn\u2019t wear one.\u201d\n\nThe White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes.\n\nWithin moments of Mr. Spicer\u2019s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe.\n\nMr. Spicer added that the story was \u201cso riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology.\u201d He went on, \u201cLiterally, blatant factual errors, and it\u2019s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.\u201d\n\nThe overall piece, which described Mr. Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic shake-up of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was \u201cnot an accurate portrayal of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Mr. Spicer concluded.\n\nThe president defends himself on Twitter\n\nMr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning.\n\nIn one Twitter post, the president rejected reports of polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order. In another, he appeared to lash out at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing.\n\nA CNN poll released over the weekend said that 55 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s travel order as an attempt to keep Muslims out of the country.\n\nThe president also seemed angry about the Bannon-in-charge story line, which was featured in a Time magazine article and in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit showing Mr. Bannon as the Grim Reaper directing Mr. Trump\u2019s activities in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d that sought to marginalize him.\n\nFriendly confines\n\nIf you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight.\n\nAnother satisfied customer?\n\nMr. Trump continued his screed against news coverage of him on Monday, training his fire at The New York Times in an apparent reaction to a portrait of his early stumbles published in Monday\u2019s editions.\n\nIn a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times\u2019s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House\u2019s most senior officials and others aware of the administration\u2019s inner workings, as \u201cfiction\u201d based on fabricated sources.\n\nMr. Trump has long delighted in denigrating The Times and claiming, falsely, that its coverage of him has led to declining readership. But in a meeting at The Times in November, he called the paper, which is among his first reads each morning, \u201ca great, great American jewel.\u201d Last week, The Times surpassed three million print and digital subscriptions, adding 276,000 net digital-only subscriptions in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined.\n\nTech companies are no friend of the travel ban\n\nIt\u2019s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order.\n\nOvernight, 97 companies \u2014 most of them technology firms, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 filed a legal brief arguing that the ban is unconstitutional and harms the interests of American businesses.\n\nThe brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201d\n\nIt is a remarkable statement of unity from the country\u2019s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNational Security officials also oppose the ban\n\nThe companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials.\n\nJustice Department corrects record on travel ban\u2019s visa impact\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an attention-grabbing claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump\u2019s executive order on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nThe government lawyer provoked gasps in the courtroom when he told Judge Leonie Brinkema, one of the Federal District Court judges weighing legal challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s order, that more than 100,000 visas had been revoked as a result of the order \u2014 far more than had been understood to be the case.\n\nThat number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60,000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban.\n\nOn Monday, the department submitted a filing to Judge Brinkema that corrected its statement in the court.\n\n\u201cIn response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60,000 visas.\u201d\n\nPermanent campaign, confirmation edition\n\nAn outside, pro-Trump political group is adding veteran fund-raisers and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president\u2019s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees.\n\nThe group, 45Committee, has signed Larry Weitzner of Jamestown Associates, which produced most of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign ads in the general election. Mr. Weitzner\u2019s first spot will air nationally this week, with a gauzy focus on the initial days of the Trump presidency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus; Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director; Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff; and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director.\n\nWith Mr. Trump\u2019s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics.\n\nArpaio holds out the tin cup\n\nJoe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for re-election.\n\nNow he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense.\n\nIn his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his re-election defeat to a host of enemies, including \u201cleftist financier George Soros,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nMr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal contempt-of-court charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge\u2019s order to stop discriminating against Latinos.\n\nAs the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area.\n\nThousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling.", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": "Michael D.
