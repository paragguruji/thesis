He argued that his cellist, whom he declined to name out of concern for the player\u2019s safety, was as Hungarian as anyone in the orchestra, and that he did not believe that the executive order, which he read, applied to dual-passport holders. The next day, after pressure from diplomats in Britain, Canada and elsewhere, Trump administration officials announced that dual citizens would be allowed to enter the country.\n\nSo when the Budapest Festival Orchestra gathered onstage at David Geffen Hall on Monday evening to play the Ninth Symphony \u2014 and the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d melody, a paean to brotherhood, was first sounded by the low strings \u2014 its cello section was intact.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe behind-the-scenes musical diplomacy was one of the more dramatic moments as the classical field adapts to a changing United States during the Trump era. The travel ban has drawn criticism from the League of American Orchestras and from Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, who wrote in The Los Angeles Times that it \u201cbetrays our immigrant roots.\u201d The Seattle Symphony planned a free Wednesday concert of music from the countries it targeted. And Christoph von Dohnanyi, the former music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, wrote a denunciation of the ban, stating that his uncle, the German Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was killed by the Nazis, would have opposed a policy that barred Muslims while making exceptions for Christians.\n\nFor American music lovers, the resolution of the Budapest ensemble\u2019s visa issue allowed them to hear one of the most admired, and unusual, orchestras of the day. Mr. Fischer is reverent about the music he conducts but not about what he sees as some of the stultifying traditions that have grown up around it.\n\nFor this week\u2019s Beethoven concerts, that meant placing the timpanist front and center, where a concerto soloist usually stands, rather than at the back of the stage; inviting students from the Juilliard School and Bard College to run onstage to play near the end of a performance of the Fifth Symphony; and sprinkling undercover members of the Concert Chorale of New York around the audience so they could pop up to sing the \u201cOde to Joy\u201d at the end of the Ninth.\n\n\u201cI think if we hear these voices from everywhere \u2014 from the audience, from us, the people, then it comes much closer to the original meaning of the work,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven his rehearsals are unusual. He began a Beethoven rehearsal at Geffen Hall on Monday morning with a Bach chorale, which he explained was a tradition: \u201cIt creates a separation between the outside world and our world \u2014 it helps the mind, it helps the soul, it helps the ears.\u201d He sometimes got down from his podium to wander among the players, and repeatedly leapt off the stage and ran to Row J to test balances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJane Moss, the artistic director of Lincoln Center, said that Mr. Fischer had become a New York favorite for his virtuosity and his expansive ideas of what concerts can be. \u201cIn 80 percent of the cases, my right eyebrow is going up as there is yet again a new idea, and every single time, it turn out to be unbelievably powerful,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Fischer will return to the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center this summer with Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d one of several well-regarded semi-staged productions for which he serves as both conductor and director. (He calls the present tradition \u201ccompletely artificial, with the director and the conductor being the two polarized forces pulling poor singers in two directions.\u201d)\n\nAsked if he saw parallels between the United States these days and Hungary \u2014 which has also had a rise in right-wing populism, battles over immigration and refugees, and the construction of a fence along its southern border \u2014 he said that he saw these trends in many places.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as an American problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI see it as a worldwide problem. We now live in a period when fear is somehow misused and stirred up. And it\u2019s an extremely dangerous phenomenon.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Cooper"], "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "helps", "world", "play", "ban", "orchestra", "triumphs", "trumps", "director", "symphony", "fischer", "music", "mr", "center"], "summary": "The next day, after pressure from diplomats in Britain, Canada and elsewhere, Trump administration officials announced that dual citizens would be allowed to enter the country.\nPhotoThe behind-the-scenes musical diplomacy was one of the more dramatic moments as the classical field adapts to a changing United States during the Trump era.\nAnd Christoph von Dohnanyi, the former music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, wrote a denunciation of the ban, stating that his uncle, the German Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was killed by the Nazis, would have opposed a policy that barred Muslims while making exceptions for Christians.\nMr. Fischer is reverent about the music he conducts but not about what he sees as some of the stultifying traditions that have grown up around it.\n\u201cI think if we hear these voices from everywhere \u2014 from the audience, from us, the people, then it comes much closer to the original meaning of the work,\u201d Mr. Fischer said."}
