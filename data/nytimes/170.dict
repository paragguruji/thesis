They traveled with their three children to Lebanon and then Egypt. But their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed Mohamed Morsi as Egypt\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cWe left our home to find safety, but in Egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid,\u201d said Ali Aldaher, Sham\u2019s father.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo the family packed up again to join thousands of other Syrian refugees in Jordan. Sham was born there in July 2015, on the day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. The coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents, but it complicated Sham\u2019s birth, as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor.\n\nEven though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth, Sham\u2019s mother \u201cdid not receive the health care she needed and I\u2019m sure all the stress hurt,\u201d Mr. Aldaher recounted.\n\nWhen Sham was born, her father tried to calm his wife by pretending Sham was keeping one eye shut, even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face.\n\n\u201cBefore the birth of Sham, my worries were how would I support my family, without any work in Jordan and without money,\u201d Mr. Aldaher said. \u201cAfter she was born, we forgot about food, our problems, ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for Sham, to see how we could possibly care for this child.\u201d\n\nSham\u2019s family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders. Lawyers from Reed Smith started searching for a hospital capable of undertaking such advanced surgery, while helping the family apply for resettlement in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lawyers then delayed the move to America because they could not simultaneously find an American hospital ready to treat Sham at no cost. Instead, the Sant Joan de D\u00e9u hospital in Barcelona agreed to help.\n\nEntering Spain, however, also proved a struggle. In June 2016, the Spanish government granted Sham\u2019s family permission to travel to Barcelona, shortly after The New York Times published an article about the infant\u2019s plight and Spain\u2019s refusal to grant visas to the whole family.\n\nEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the United States, on security grounds, many European governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees, following a European Union agreement reached in September 2015. By the end of 2016, about 900 refugees had resettled in Spain, out of the quota of 17,377 agreed on by Spain\u2019s government.\n\nPhoto\n\nSham underwent two major facial surgeries in Barcelona. In August, doctors reset her facial bones, also to make room for an eye orbit. In December, they fissured her skin into an eyelid and implanted fat taken from Sham\u2019s bottom into the artificial orbit, which was then re-covered with a curved plastic shell. Sham is due to receive her eye prosthesis next Wednesday.\n\nDr. Joan Prat, the chief ophthalmologist at the Sant Joan de D\u00e9u hospital, said he used a unique technique to \u201cinvent a cavity from zero.\u201d The eye surgery was not only difficult but also urgent, because Sham\u2019s face will soon reach a level of development that would make the disfigurement permanent.\n\n\u201cEither we did something now or it was game over,\u201d Dr. Prat said. The kind of disorder suffered by Sham, known as anophthalmia, occurs \u201conly every few years,\u201d he added.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows, while her eye prothesis will also need replacement.\n\nSham and her family were granted residency in Spain until late December. They have been housed in a three-bedroom apartment, a stone\u2019s throw from the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Barcelona\u2019s emblematic basilica.\n\nMs. Fleming said that the family wanted to live in the United States in large part because Sham could get excellent follow-up medical care there. She acknowledged that the family was now concerned about a backlash against Muslims in America and that \u201cthey are distressed by rhetoric that brands them as terrorists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Barcelona, Sham\u2019s family has received support from the city, as well as Caritas and other nongovernmental organizations. Sham\u2019s siblings have joined a local school.\n\nOn a bookshelf, the family keeps a small Quran that is among the few items that traveled with them from Syria. A prayer mat is also pinned to the wall, but the family normally goes to a Barcelona mosque for Friday Prayer.\n\nWhen the girl was born, her mother gave her an ancient name for Syria, Sham. Wherever the family finally ends up living, she said, \u201cone day Sham will ask me what is the meaning of her name and I will at least be able to tell her that it is your country, it is Syria.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "authors": "Raphael Minder", "type": "article"}
