They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq.\n\nThe fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded. So \u201cmassacre\u201d? No. In Bowling Green? No. Refugees? Well, yes, sort of.\n\nMs. Conway now says she misspoke.\n\nBut things got really hot when a Clinton jumped into the fray \u2014 Chelsea Clinton.\n\nWhich only stoked old campaign feuds, and a reminder of the exaggerated claim from Hillary Clinton that, as first lady, she once landed in war-torn Bosnia under fire from hostile Serbs.\n\nIt never ends.\n\nTrump to Uber: Well, we can\u2019t print it.\n\nPresident Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him. Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the new online newsletter Axios, Mr. Trump had an unpleasant conversation with the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, after the brash entrepreneur quit the president\u2019s business council in protest of his executive order banning some foreigners from entering the country.\n\nSome in Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d suggested that Mr. Kalanick was cutting off his access to the White House. Mr. Kalanick might be a little more concerned with all the smartphone users\u2019 dropping their Uber app in favor of Lyft, a competitor that was first to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSenate up early for DeVos\n\nIn an unusual early morning session, the Senate on Friday cleared an important procedural hurdle to approving Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, setting up a final, nail-biting confirmation vote next week.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s 52-to-48 vote along party lines to limit further debate on her nomination is deceptive. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, went along with the procedural vote, but they say they will oppose her on the final vote, expected on Tuesday.\n\nCallers have overwhelmed the Capitol\u2019s phone system, many of them expressing angry opposition to Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination. Senators have heard from all manner of educators in their home states opposing her confirmation \u2014 and not just teachers\u2019 unions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe opposition from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski raises the prospects of a 50-to-50 tie that Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, would have to settle.\n\nAfter convening at 6:30 a.m., one of the earliest starts in recent memory, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, urged his colleagues to take stock of their positions on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination over the weekend. \u201dSometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,\u201d he said on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy so early? Under Senate rules, a set amount of time had to elapse between the first procedural actions, which took place Wednesday afternoon, and Friday\u2019s vote.\n\nSenators start bipartisan inquiry into Russian election meddling\n\nRemember Russia? The country that intelligence officials believe interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf?\n\nTwo weeks into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, talk of the foreign power\u2019s apparent role has somewhat faded from view, at least temporarily, in the daily avalanche of White House exploits and misadventures.\n\nBut Capitol Hill will have its say. Two senators are convening an investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference, joining other efforts in Congress to examine what happened.\n\nSenators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said their investigation would focus on Russian interference both in the United States\u2019 election and in other elections around the world. (Mr. Graham is the chairman and Mr. Whitehouse is the ranking member of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is focused on crime and terrorism.)\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple,\u201d the senators said in a joint statement. \u201cTo the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy.\u201d\n\nThere are already multiple Senate committee examinations into Russia\u2019s role, as well as an inquiry by the House.\n\nTrump will keep Obama\u2019s White House doctor\n\nDr. Harold N. Bornstein has been President Trump\u2019s personal doctor for more than 35 years. He prescribed Mr. Trump the prostate-related drug that keeps the presidential mane flowing, and declared him the healthiest man to hold the highest office in the land.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for now, Mr. Trump will keep the same White House doctor who cared for Barack Obama, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy.\n\nThe decision, first reported by the online medical journal Stat, raised the possibility that voters might actually get some reliable information on the health of their commander in chief.\n\nC.E.O. meeting at White House could be heating up\n\nThe meeting of big-shot chief executives at the White House on Friday \u2014 people like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone \u2014 was supposed to prove the bona fides of the new, business-focused businessman-turned-president.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries has complicated the discussion considerably.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
