Bush, said Mr. Trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that Mr. Bush\u2019s staff would never have dreamed of doing 15 years ago, because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda. President Obama has become adept at doing the same thing in recent years, through videos posted on Facebook and other media.\n\nMr. Fleischer said, \u201cHe\u2019s just doing more of what President Obama successfully did, and what I\u2019m fascinated about is, what does this mean for the future?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

By Monday, Mr. Trump\u2019s @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account, which he enjoys using, had 15.7 million followers. Once in the White House, he will inherit @POTUS, with its 12.1 million online followers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump also spent Monday at his office in Trump Tower, interviewing a stream of potential Republican cabinet candidates. They included Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas; former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts; and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democrat.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about Mr. Trump\u2019s video was what he did not say in it.\n\nOn immigration, he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico or his desire to deport immigrants here illegally, whether or not they have a criminal record. He made no mention of ending President Obama\u2019s program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump simply promised to direct the Labor Department to investigate visa abuses.\n\nThe tough-talking president-elect, who has often railed against Mr. Obama and \u201cthe generals\u201d for what he often called their \u201cstupid\u201d conduct of foreign policy, said nothing in the video about fighting terrorism, confronting Russian aggression or pressuring NATO allies to pay more for their common defense.\n\nInstead, he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard America\u2019s vital infrastructure from \u201ccyberattacks, and all other form of attacks.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the campaign, offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the Oval Office.\n\nSome, like his pledge to \u201cissue our notification of intent to withdraw from the trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d trade deal, will be well within his power as president to accomplish. But his additional promise to \u201cnegotiate fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores\u201d will be in the eyes of the beholder, and may not produce the results he expects.\n\nOthers appear to be overblown political hyperbole, like his promise in the video to \u201ccancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy \u2014 including shale energy and clean coal \u2014 creating many millions of high-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nHe did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in \u201cmany millions\u201d of jobs. Even supporters of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which Mr. Trump has said he will greenlight once in office, do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built.\n\nMr. Fleischer said Mr. Trump\u2019s more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse for fiery speech when he felt it was in his interest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe has said this about himself, that he knows how to be really boring when he wants to be,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s so self-aware about the fact that there are these two Trumps, and we\u2019re seeing more of the other one since he won.\u201d", "publish_date": "2016-11-21", "authors": "Michael D.
