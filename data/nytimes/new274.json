Now many are following the potential indictment of the Muslim Brotherhood as a harbinger of things to come.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration moved us away from the \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 narrative,\u201d said Emad Shahin, a dissident Egyptian academic who lectures at Georgetown University. \u201cTrump is taking us deeper into it.\u201d\n\nNot all are unhappy about the move to list the Brotherhood.\n\nOne leader the designation would surely delight is President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the former general who has led a harsh crackdown on the Brotherhood since the military ousted a Brotherhood leader, Mohamed Morsi, as president in 2013. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also would support it.\n\nBut in countries where Brotherhood-linked parties are prominent in Parliament or are in power, experts say a sweeping indictment could have serious implications for domestic politics, American diplomacy and the broader fight against Islamist extremism.\n\nIn Jordan, a crucial ally in the fight against jihadist groups, Islamists constitute a small but significant bloc in the Parliament. Tunisia\u2019s Ennahda party, which has won wide praise for its democratic engagement and moderate stance since 2011, might be shunned. The prime minister of Morocco, technically, could be considered a criminal.\n\n\u201cYou would throw many babies out with the bath water,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former United States ambassador to Yemen, now at the Middle East Institute in Washington.\n\nThe initial momentum toward such a designation appears to have slowed. A leaked assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency said isolating the Brotherhood would serve only to empower jihadist groups; some experts doubt that a broad designation would pass legal muster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the very fact that the ban is under consideration by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides is being taken as an ominous sign in a region where religion and politics are carefully, and often precariously, balanced.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe proposed designation has also reaffirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent embrace of Mr. Sisi, who has weathered a barrage of international criticism for his country\u2019s dismal human rights record in recent years. Mr. Trump has hailed him as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d with whom he shares \u201cgood chemistry.\u201d\n\nSince an initial meeting at the United Nations in September, the two leaders have spoken several times by phone \u2014 Mr. Sisi was the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr. Trump on his victory in November \u2014 and now a visit to Washington by Mr. Sisi is under preparation.\n\nEgypt wants the United States to resume a military financing program, frozen by President Barack Obama in 2015, that helps it make billions of dollars in purchases of big-ticket weapons like F-16 warplanes and M1A1 Abrams tanks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We thought we would stand by the shah of Iran until the day he got on an airplane and left the country. Now what do we have to show for it? We have 40 years of not being able to have a relationship with Iran.\u201d\n\nBrotherhood officials insist that the Trump administration has gotten it wrong. In a letter smuggled from the high-security Egyptian prison where he is being held, the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad admitted that his party had made serious mistakes during its yearlong stint in power in Egypt from 2012 to 2013. Citing the \u201chard-learned lessons of the Arab Spring,\u201d he said the Brotherhood had failed to heed loud opposition from millions of Egyptians who disliked Mr. Morsi\u2019s actions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, he insisted, the movement renounced bloodshed. \u201cOur flaws are many,\u201d he wrote. \u201cViolence is not one.\u201d\n\nIn other places, the reality can be harder to pin down. By nature secretive, the Brotherhood takes different forms around the world. In some places, its members have condoned or committed violent acts. Its Palestinian offshoot, Hamas, carries out suicide bombings; in Egypt, angry young supporters have been accused of attacking Mr. Sisi\u2019s security forces.\n\nBut that does not make terrorists of the many millions of people who support the Brotherhood\u2019s political ideology across many countries.\n\nOne route for the Trump administration could be to narrowly designate specific Brotherhood branches as terrorists, said Mokhtar Awad, an expert on the group. But it would be better still, he argued, to \u201cengage in a battle of ideas.\u201d\n\nThe debate could prove an early lesson for the administration in doing business in the Middle East, which has long resisted broad-brush prescriptions. Unpalatable as its ideas may be to Trump officials, the Brotherhood may become just one of many factors they will be forced to grapple with.\n\n\u201cWe engage with the Brotherhood knowing they are problematic actors, but they are also a reality,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation. \u201cAnd the alternative \u2014 ignoring or repressing them \u2014 leads to a very bad place.\u201d", "authors": ["Declan Walsh"], "publish_date": "2017-02-20", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["administration", "mr", "middle", "trump", "listing", "designation", "allies", "brotherhood", "united", "arab", "talk", "east", "leader", "terror", "muslim", "alarms", "sisi"], "summary": "In much of the Middle East, though, the rapid pace and embattled rollouts of Mr. Trump\u2019s early orders have induced anxiety.\n\u201cTrump is taking us deeper into it.\u201dNot all are unhappy about the move to list the Brotherhood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say you will stand by your friends,\u201d said Mr. Feierstein at the Middle East Institute.\nWe have 40 years of not being able to have a relationship with Iran.\u201dBrotherhood officials insist that the Trump administration has gotten it wrong.\nOne route for the Trump administration could be to narrowly designate specific Brotherhood branches as terrorists, said Mokhtar Awad, an expert on the group."}
