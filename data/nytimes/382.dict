Gorsuch to fill a seat left vacant for more than a year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The new case will be an early indication of how Justice Gorsuch affects the balance of power on the court.\n\nA week into his presidency, on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump issued an executive order to ban travel from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It also banned all Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order was blocked by the Ninth Circuit in February.\n\nIn March, Mr. Trump issued a new, revised ban that narrowed the scope of his original order. It omitted Iraq from the countries that faced the travel scrutiny and allowed case-by-case exceptions for travelers from the others. It also removed the complete ban on Syrian refugees and deleted explicit references to religion.\n\nLike the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 110,000.\n\nIn its brief, the Trump administration urged the court to place law above politics.\n\n\u201cThis order has been the subject of passionate political debate,\u201d the brief said. \u201cBut whatever one\u2019s views, the precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s national security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order, and this constitutional moment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPrecisely in cases that spark such intense feelings, it is all the more critical to adhere to foundational legal rules,\u201d the brief said. It said the lower court ruling \u201cdeparts from those rules, and calls into question the executive and his authority in a way that warrants this court\u2019s review.\u201d\n\nOmar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people and groups challenging the ban, said the Supreme Court should let the appeals court decision stand.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to disturb the Fourth Circuit\u2019s ruling, which was supported by an overwhelming majority of the judges on the full court, is consistent with rulings from other courts across the nation, and enforces a fundamental principle that protects all of us from government condemnation of our religious beliefs,\u201d he said.", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
