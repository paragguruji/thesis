He said he could not provide a specific number.\n\nThe Justice Department referred a request for that figure to the Customs and Border Protection agency, which declined to comment because of the continuing litigation.\n\nAt the hearing, Judge Amon ordered the government to inform the plaintiffs how many of the 746 people on the government\u2019s list had been allowed to enter the country, and to investigate the cases the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said had been omitted.\n\nThe list included only the given name and surname of those who were detained and did not mention nationalities. Judge Amon had not ordered that contact information be included.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is put together a puzzle, to which the government has all the pieces,\u201d said Muneer I. Ahmad, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs.\n\nWhen Mr. Ahmad questioned why the people he and his colleagues cited were missing from the list, Mr. Press replied, \u201cThe government is not omniscient.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order was halted on Feb. 9 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Seattle. The Trump administration has said it plans to issue a revised order next week.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p.m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a \u201csnapshot\u201d to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnelly\u2019s ruling, from 9:37 p.m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p.m. on Jan. 29.\n\nThe list provided by the government did not include refugees because they generally do not arrive on weekends, said Rebecca Heller, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAccording to documents submitted to the court by the American Civil Liberties Union, some of those detained described having their phones confiscated, their requests to talk to lawyers denied and, in some cases, being coerced into signing forms that resulted in their deportation.\n\nSara Yarjani, an Iranian citizen who is studying for a master\u2019s degree in holistic health in California, was held for 23 hours at Los Angeles International Airport before being deported, after Judge Donnelly issued her ruling, according to court filings.\n\nSuha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who was born in Saudi Arabia and has a valid work visa, was detained at Kennedy Airport for 10 hours and deported, according to the filings.\n\nThere is an urgent need to find those on the government\u2019s list of people who were held, said Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer with the A.C.L.U. for detainees. He said he feared that those people might be forgotten once the Trump administration releases new travel restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to get everybody back, and then we\u2019ll fight the new executive order,\u201d Mr. Gelernt said.", "publish_date": "2017-02-24", "authors": "Liz Robbins", "type": "article"}
