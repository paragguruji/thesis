One veteran left-wing lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, Dennis Skinner, rose from his seat and said to Mr. Bercow: \u201cTwo words: Well done!\u201d\n\nSome female Labour deputies called for a boycott of any Trump speech. And so far there has been no attempt in Parliament to bring up for discussion a no-confidence motion in Mr. Bercow. That suggests that lawmakers may be reluctant to upset the speaker, who controls debates, or have calculated that he would survive any vote to unseat him.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Bercow\u2019s intervention is not conclusive, as the lord speaker, the speaker of the House of Lords and the lord great chamberlain, who represents Queen Elizabeth, would also have to agree to any government request to invite a head of state to speak in Parliament. On Tuesday, the lord speaker, Norman Fowler, said that he would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d on whether to invite Mr. Trump and that Mr. Bercow had apologized for a lack of consultation before his statement on Monday.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Bercow\u2019s comments made it unlikely that such an invitation would be made, and they provoked the wrath of Conservative-leaning newspapers. The Daily Telegraph, a conservative broadsheet, argued that \u201cthe contents of Mr. Bercow\u2019s near-hysterical rant about President Donald Trump\u2019s planned state visit to Britain are unacceptable,\u201d while The Sun, a right-wing tabloid, described the speaker as an \u201cegomaniac\u201d in an editorial titled \u201cBerk Bercow.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it is not clear that Mr. Trump has any desire to address Parliament, particularly given that some deputies have threatened to boycott any address. (In contrast, he has said that he is a fan of the queen and eager to meet her.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Britain, there has been fierce criticism of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, particularly his ban on visits to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries. Last year, British lawmakers debated whether to ban Mr. Trump himself from the country but mainly rejected the idea. (Mr. Trump\u2019s mother was born in Scotland.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the unease has been compounded by the uncustomary speed of the invitation to Mr. Trump, so soon after he was inaugurated. Mrs. May\u2019s critics say she rushed into the move to ingratiate herself with Mr. Trump because she is desperate to conclude a quick trade deal with the United States to help compensate for Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, it would have been prudent to wait before rolling the royal red carpet,\u201d wrote Andrew Rawnsley of The Observer, the Sunday sister newspaper of The Guardian, adding: \u201cPimping out the Queen for Donald Trump. This, apparently, is what they meant by getting our sovereignty back.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, there was another reminder of the lingering divisions over withdrawal from the European Union, this one from Scotland, where a majority in last year\u2019s referendum voted to remain in the bloc.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament voted Tuesday to oppose Mrs. May\u2019s plans to begin negotiations on withdrawal by the end of March.", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": "Stephen Castle", "type": "article"}
