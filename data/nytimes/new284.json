Bush Levels Tacit Criticism at Trump", "text": "\u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Mr. Bush told Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host. \u201cWe need the media to hold people like me to account. I mean, power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive and it\u2019s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to suggest that language like Mr. Trump\u2019s made it more difficult to press authoritarian leaders like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to tolerate a free press. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to, you know, tell others to have an independent free press when we\u2019re not willing to have one ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bush also urged tolerance when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to temporarily ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. As president, Mr. Bush made a point of visiting a mosque after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regularly insisted that the United States was not at war with Islam.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to worship the way they want to or not worship at all,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cI mean the bedrock of our freedom \u2014 a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.\u201d\n\nAsked if he supported a ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, the former president said, \u201cI am for an immigration policy that\u2019s welcoming and upholds the law.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The book, his third since leaving office, is a collection of 66 portraits of military veterans he has gotten to know personally. It also includes a four-panel mural he painted of several active and former members of the military. The paintings will be displayed at his presidential center in Dallas from March to October.\n\nMr. Bush picked up painting after leaving office when the historian John Lewis Gaddis mentioned that it was a hobby of Winston Churchill\u2019s. The former president\u2019s initial efforts focused on his pets as subjects. Then he painted a series of portraits of world leaders he met while in office, including Mr. Putin, and displayed them at his center.\n\nMr. Bush, who as commander in chief ordered American forces into Afghanistan and Iraq, hosts regular bicycle rides and golf tournaments with wounded veterans and decided to make them his next focus. He started painting them in September 2015. Some of the portraits in the book show veterans with prosthetic limbs. A few depict amputees playing golf.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI painted these men and women as a way to honor their service to the country and to show my respect for their sacrifice and courage,\u201d he wrote in the book. \u201cI hope to draw attention to the challenges some face when they come home and transition to civilian life \u2014 and the need for our country to better address them.\u201d", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "publish_date": "2017-02-27", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["book", "veterans", "tacit", "trump", "george", "office", "painted", "worship", "portraits", "levels", "press", "w", "president", "criticism", "mr", "bush"], "summary": "\u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Mr. Bush told Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host.\nPhotoMr. Bush also urged tolerance when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to temporarily ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nAs president, Mr. Bush made a point of visiting a mosque after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regularly insisted that the United States was not at war with Islam.\nBut Mr. Bush, who has emphasized the importance of not criticizing a successor, tried to avoid seeming too critical of Mr. Trump.\nMr. Bush picked up painting after leaving office when the historian John Lewis Gaddis mentioned that it was a hobby of Winston Churchill\u2019s."}
