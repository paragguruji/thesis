Before she even finished packing up her office, she had become a hero to many Democrats, the face of a simmering resistance inside the government to Mr. Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nVideo\n\nHer firing was a politically divisive turn in a career that had, until now, earned her bipartisan praise.\n\n\u201cShe will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what\u2019s right,\u201d Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said in 2015 at Ms. Yates\u2019s confirmation hearing. \u201cShe\u2019ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Yates was a reliably liberal voice in the Justice Department on issues of civil rights, criminal justice and sentencing, she worked her way up as a career prosecutor in Atlanta under political appointees from both parties. A native Georgian, she led prosecutions against some of the highest profile defendants in Atlanta, including former Mayor Bill Campbell, a Democrat who was accused of racketeering and tax fraud, and Eric Robert Rudolph, who set bombs at a park during the 1996 Olympic Games, a gay nightclub and two Southern abortion clinics.\n\nShe also took on the leaders of an Atlanta suburb who refused to allow construction of a mosque. The Justice Department sued, and the city reversed itself. \u201cReligious freedom requires that local government decisions impacting the exercise of that freedom be free of discrimination,\u201d Ms. Yates said at the time.\n\nWhen Ms. Yates, who declined to comment on Tuesday, became deputy attorney general in 2015, she told colleagues that she had no intention of merely being a caretaker. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run through the tape,\u201d she often said.\n\nIn Washington, her outgoing personality made her a counterpoint to her more reserved boss, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. At times that made Ms. Yates the face of the Justice Department in ways that caused tension with Ms. Lynch\u2019s staff. Ms. Yates was regarded as professionally ambitious, though she has told friends that she has no interest in running for political office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Comey, from sending a letter to Congress in the final days of the presidential campaign. The letter raised the prospect of new and potentially damaging evidence against Hillary Clinton related to an investigation that had been closed. Nothing came of the new evidence, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team says the letter cost her the presidency. Her supporters argued that Justice Department leaders were too timid to stand up to Mr. Comey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s executive order prompted a new challenge for Ms. Yates, who was serving until the Senate confirmed a new attorney general. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel had reviewed and signed off on the order, but Ms. Yates believed that the department had to also consider the president\u2019s intent, which she said appeared aimed at singling out people based on religion.\n\nMr. Trump had promised to do as much. His campaign website still calls for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d After the decision was announced, one of his advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said in an interview that Mr. Trump had wanted a Muslim ban but needed \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d Mr. Trump then said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that Christian refugees would be given priority for entry visas to the United States.\n\nIn meetings on Monday, some in the department said it should defend the order, as it normally does. Others disagreed.\n\nProminent lawyers echoed that debate on Tuesday. Some former Justice Department officials, like Martin Lederman, praised Ms. Yates\u2019s decision. Ms. Lynch said \u201cher courageous leadership embodies the highest traditions of the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nBut others, like Jack Goldsmith, said she should have either defended the president\u2019s order or resigned. George J. Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who, like Ms. Yates, served briefly as acting attorney general, said that Ms. Yates had made herself and the Justice Department \u201clook blatantly political.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Yates considered resigning, four current and former Justice Department officials said, but she concluded that doing so would only defer a difficult decision to a temporary successor.\n\nThat dilemma was foreshadowed two years ago in her confirmation hearing, when Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is poised to become the next attorney general, questioned whether Ms. Yates had the independent streak needed to be the Justice Department\u2019s second in command.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?\u201d Mr. Sessions asked.\n\n\u201cI believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,\u201d Ms. Yates replied.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on Monday, roughly three hours after she ordered department lawyers not to defend the president\u2019s position, a White House courier arrived with a copy of her dismissal letter.\n\n\u201cDear Deputy Attorney General Yates,\u201d said the letter, which was signed by John DeStefano, an assistant to Mr. Trump. \u201cI am informing you that the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": "Alan Blinder and Matt Apuzzo", "type": "article"}
