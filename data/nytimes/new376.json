The second order allowed case-by-case exceptions for incoming travelers and lifted the ban against Iraqi visitors. It also deleted explicit references to religion.\n\nBut both orders suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 110,000. And in Thursday\u2019s ruling, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail \u2014 where he called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d \u2014 showed that the revised order remained the product of religious hostility.\n\nSuch discrimination, Judge Gregory wrote for the majority, violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion. The Trump administration had urged the appeals court to ignore the statements as loose language made before the president assumed office. But Judge Gregory said the court could take account of the comments.\n\n\u201cThen-candidate Trump\u2019s campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States,\u201d Judge Gregory wrote.\n\nThe appeals court vote was 10 to 3 and divided along ideological lines, with the three Republican appointees in dissent. Two other judges, both appointed by Republican presidents, recused themselves.\n\nIn dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer said that the majority had made a grave error in considering Mr. Trump\u2019s political comments to interpret his executive orders, calling campaign statements ambiguous by nature and \u201coften shorthand for larger ideas; they are explained, modified, retracted and amplified as they are repeated and as new circumstances and arguments arise.\u201d\n\nJudge Niemeyer also predicted that the majority\u2019s reliance on campaign statements would meet a hostile reception in the Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds \u2014 one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation,\u201d he wrote. And Judge Dennis W. Shedd, also in dissent, wrote that those welcoming Thursday\u2019s decision had missed the larger point.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Ordinarily, a three-judge panel would have heard the case and decided it, with the possibility of full-court review afterward.\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Niemeyer wrote that the law did not permit judges to second-guess a president\u2019s national security judgments.\n\nBut Judge Gregory wrote that courts had a role to play.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Supreme Court has certainly encouraged deference in our review of immigration matters that implicate national security interests,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit has not countenanced judicial abdication, especially where constitutional rights, values and principles are at stake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was more than plausible, he added, that the revised order\u2019s \u201cstated national security interest was provided in bad faith, as a pretext for its religious purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has repeatedly asked this court to ignore evidence, circumscribe our own review, and blindly defer to executive action, all in the name of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers,\u201d Judge Gregory wrote.\n\n\u201cWe decline to do so, not only because it is the particular province of the judicial branch to say what the law is, but also because we would do a disservice to our constitutional structure were we to let its mere invocation silence the call for meaningful judicial review.\u201d\n\nIn March, federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked parts of the new executive order, saying they could not ignore the remarks from Mr. Trump and his allies. \u201cSimply because a decision maker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them\u201d from judicial memory, Judge Theodore D. Chuang of Federal District Court in Maryland wrote in the decision under review by the appeals court.\n\n\n\nA second appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, heard arguments recently in an appeal of the Hawaii decision. That court is expected to rule shortly.\n\nMr. Trump issued his initial order on Jan. 27, a week into his presidency. Less than two weeks later, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed an order halting it.\n\nThough Mr. Trump vowed to fight the ruling, he did not appeal to the Supreme Court. Instead, he issued a revised executive order. This time around, the administration will appeal, setting the stage for a major constitutional showdown.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "wrote", "campaign", "revised", "ban", "appeals", "judge", "court", "trumps", "gregory", "reinstate", "statements", "order", "decision"], "summary": "The revised order sought to soften the original ban, which was almost immediately blocked after foreign travelers found themselves stranded at chaotic airports and protesters nationwide called the policy un-American.\nSuch discrimination, Judge Gregory wrote for the majority, violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion.\nThe Trump administration had urged the appeals court to ignore the statements as loose language made before the president assumed office.\nThe appeals court vote was 10 to 3 and divided along ideological lines, with the three Republican appointees in dissent.\nA second appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, heard arguments recently in an appeal of the Hawaii decision."}
