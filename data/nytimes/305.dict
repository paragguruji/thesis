{"title": "Hawaii Sues to Block Trump Travel Ban; First Challenge to Order", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/us/trump-travel-ban-hawaii.html?mcubz=0", "text": "\u201cThis order brings back memories for a lot of people here,\u201d Mr. Chin said. \u201cAny time you have an executive order or some government decision that\u2019s calling out people by their nation of origin or by religion, we\u2019ve got to be a check against that.\u201d\n\nBut it is unclear whether Hawaii\u2019s legal challenge can halt Mr. Trump\u2019s revised executive action the way a Washington State lawsuit doomed his first version.\n\nAmong other Democratic attorneys general, there is concern that the new order may be drawn carefully enough to survive the scrutiny of a court.\n\nSeveral attorneys general from states that challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s original travel ban, including New York, Massachusetts and Washington, have said they are still studying the new order to determine whether they believe it is constitutional.\n\nMr. Chin, 50, a deep-voiced career litigator who was appointed to his post, rather than elected, has shown an appetite for challenging Mr. Trump in recent weeks. At a meeting between Mr. Trump and state attorneys general last week in Washington, Mr. Chin pressed Mr. Trump to defend the thinking behind his attempts to crack down on travel from the Middle East.\n\nMr. Trump replied by asking if Mr. Chin was among the attorneys general who had sued over his travel ban, and then said he was trying to \u201cmake America safe,\u201d according to Mr. Chin and two other people who were present for the meeting.\n\nMr. Chin said the president had also acknowledged to the group that \u201ca lot of us wouldn\u2019t like how he was approaching that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Hawaii and San Francisco cases.\n\nEven amid the multiplying legal challenges to Trump administration policies, both actions stand out for their aggressive approach. While many mayors have denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to withhold federal funding from cities on the basis of immigration policy, they have also largely declined to take pre-emptive action against the presidential order, pledging to do so in the event that he actually carries out his threat.\n\nIn San Francisco on Wednesday, the city attorney, Dennis Herrera, argued that a district court should prevent Mr. Trump from even trying to enforce his order while the city challenges its legality. Mr. Herrera said that because the city budget relies on federal funding, San Francisco could not develop a realistic spending plan \u201cunder a cloud of uncertainty and a budgetary sword of Damocles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis court action is designed to protect our residents and provide financial clarity,\u201d Mr. Herrera said in a statement.\n\nSanta Clara County, Calif., has also requested an injunction against Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement order, for similar reasons.\n\nKaren Tumlin, the legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, which opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban and his order on sanctuary cities, called the legal actions on Wednesday a forerunner to other forceful challenges in the coming days.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And it no longer provides for special treatment for Christians and other religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim countries affected by the ban.\n\nJames E. Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who works extensively with current state attorneys general, said most Democrats were approaching Mr. Trump\u2019s new order cautiously.\n\nMr. Tierney, a Democrat, said state lawyers were \u201cresearching the constitutionality\u201d of the order before settling on a public course of action.\n\n\u201cThey believe strongly that just because they don\u2019t like something, doesn\u2019t mean it is unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Tierney said.\n\nIf the Hawaii lawsuit faces uncertain odds, it may still have the effect of putting pressure on other blue states to sue over Mr. Trump\u2019s order, or to join with advocacy groups that intend to file lawsuits of their own.\n\nIn the wave of litigation against the first, abruptly issued order, a number of attorneys general cited the massive disruption it caused for travelers with legal rights to enter the United States, as well as the damage it might do to state universities, public hospitals and other government-backed institutions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s new order is more carefully tailored, and Hawaii\u2019s lawsuit relies on a more limited set of claims. It emphasizes the possibility that people with single-use or expiring visas might be blocked from traveling, and that lawful residents of Hawaii might be inappropriately blocked from sponsoring family members from overseas to join them in the United States.\n\nThe complaint \u2014 a revised version of the document Mr. Chin\u2019s office filed as a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s first order \u2014 also cites comments last month by Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, describing any changes to the initial travel ban as technical adjustments intended to preserve the same \u201cbasic policy outcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA federal judge has scheduled a hearing for March 15 to consider Hawaii\u2019s request for a temporary block on Mr. Trump\u2019s order.
