It said refugees were subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States, involving the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center and the F.B.I.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump has not commented on the deal. As a presidential candidate, he called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration, though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants from \u201cterror-prone regions.\u201d One of his supporters, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors more restrictive immigration policies, was quoted in Australian news reports as saying that the deal was likely to be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d once Mr. Trump took office.\n\nThe United Nations envoy, Fran\u00e7ois Cr\u00e9peau, said on Friday that conditions for detainees on Nauru were grim.\n\n\u201cMental health issues are rife, with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression being among the most common ailments,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9peau said at a news conference in Canberra, the Australian capital, describing what he found on a recent visit to Nauru. \u201cMany refugees and asylum seekers are on a constant diet of sleeping tablets and antidepressants.\u201d Children suffered from insomnia, nightmares and bed-wetting, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To me, mandatory detention is a violation of human rights law.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations has endorsed the plan to send about 1,600 detainees to the United States. The camps were opened in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nManus Island is holding 823 men. About 410 men, women and children, mostly in family groups, are held on Nauru and would be given the first option to resettle in the United States under the new agreement. About 400 others in Australia seeking some medical treatment must return to Nauru or Manus Island before applying to go to the United States.\n\n\n\nOnly those who have been granted refugee status by the United Nations will be eligible to go to the United States, the Australian government has said. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia and the State Department have said the deal would not affect the total number of refugees accepted by the United States each year.\n\nMr. Turnbull said the deal was the result of months of talks, but he offered little reassurance that it would be honored under Mr. Trump. \u201cWe deal with one administration at a time,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said Sunday.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised during the hearing on Tuesday. One senator, Murray Watt, asked Mr. Pezzullo, the immigration secretary, whether the government was sure that the deal would be honored, given Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about refugees and Muslims. About 10 percent of the detainees are from Iran, while others are from Afghanistan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cWe have an agreement struck between the two governments and, should other contingencies or other eventualities arise, that is a matter that the Australian government will have to deal with at that time,\u201d Mr. Pezzullo said.", "publish_date": "2016-11-18", "authors": "Michelle Innis", "type": "article"}
