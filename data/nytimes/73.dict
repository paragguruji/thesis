Mr. Moya\u2019s bill, which had the backing of other Assembly members, would prohibit law enforcement agents from stopping, questioning, investigating or arresting an individual on the basis of a suspected immigration violation. \u201cNo state or local law enforcement agency, or agent thereof, shall perform the function of or be cross-designated as a federal immigration officer,\u201d the bill states.\n\nA draft of Mr. Trump\u2019s next order, which remained unsigned on Thursday, included an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and a temporary ban on immigrants coming from Muslim countries with known terrorist ties.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country\u2019s largest Muslim civil liberties organization, sponsored the protest on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMuslim-Americans have been attacked over and over again,\u201d said Afaf Nasher, executive director of CAIR New York. \u201cBut we are resilient and strong, and we will come back with more protests, until we have our civil rights.

He works with the New York Police Department, and since the Sept. 11 attacks, he has encouraged his community to report crimes and to not fear the police.\n\n\u201cThese orders are really putting a gray cloud over the hard work in building these relationships and encouraging the community to be part of mainstream America,\u201d Mr. Razvi said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat this administration is emphasizing is dividing the country,\u201d he added. \u201cOur fellow Americans are going to view these Muslims as the enemy, when this is not the case.\u201d\n\nMr. Razvi\u2019s bustling storefront office, which offers English classes all day, legal counseling and youth programs, sits next to a mosque in Midwood. He said that on Wednesday he was continuously stopped by concerned citizens wondering what would happen to them. Some, he said, worried that family members coming from certain countries would be denied visas. And he said neighborhood business owners reported fewer people shopping.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty is what\u2019s really causing fear,\u201d he said.", "publish_date": "2017-01-26", "authors": "Liz Robbins", "type": "article"}
