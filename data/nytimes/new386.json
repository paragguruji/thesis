More than 190 countries \u2014 most of the countries on the planet \u2014 are signatories to the agreement. We have one planet. It is in trouble. The world must band together to save it. How does it look for the world\u2019s last remaining superpower to simply walk away?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

This is putting our future and the future of the planet in peril. This is dumb, hazardous and shortsighted.\n\nTrump justified his move using faulty information, citing issues that are not even in the agreement and flat-out lying. What else is new? Perhaps his most memorable line from his speech about the withdrawal was:\n\n\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that, as PolitiFact pointed out:\n\n\u201cClinton won almost 60 percent of the vote in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. The percentage was even higher in many precincts within the city of Pittsburgh itself. (Allegheny County includes a range of suburbs in addition to the city.)\u201d\n\nIndeed, the mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, told CNN after the speech: \u201cThe city of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton with nearly 80 percent of the vote.\u201d Later on CNN, Peduto was asked if he had a message for Trump. Peduto responded: \u201cWhat you did was not only bad for the economy of this country, but also weakened America in this world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, mayors, governors and business leaders across the country were quick to rebuke Trump\u2019s horrendous decision and to dedicate themselves to the spirit of the agreement.\n\nThen, for me, the icing on the cake was Trump\u2019s absolute lack of grace and tact in his response to the London terror attacks over the weekend. His first response was not to express his horror and extend America\u2019s condolences and offer American assistance. No, that would have required that he possess a shred of empathy and common decency.\n\nInstead, his first instinct was to use the attacks as political fodder to advance his own failed domestic agenda to impose a \u201ctravel ban.\u201d\n\nShortly after the attacks, while people were still trying to get their minds around what exactly had happened in London, Trump tweeted:\n\n\u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d\n\n(Note that Trump again calls it a \u201cban,\u201d although White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who retweeted this message, scolded the media in January for calling Trump\u2019s ban a ban, saying: \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban, it\u2019s not a travel ban, it\u2019s a vetting system to keep America safe.\u201d Trump is killing himself in the courts with his own words.)\n\nTrump is pulling America back and pulling America down. We are now witnessing the incredible shrinking America, and it\u2019s a sad sight to behold.", "authors": ["Charles M.
