But the department added that little had changed.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s executive orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNo foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe four cases \u2014 in Boston, Brooklyn, Seattle and Alexandria, Va. \u2014 will move forward in the coming weeks, with briefs and hearings over whether to make the bans on removing the travelers more permanent. At the same time, the Trump administration may appeal the orders to federal appellate courts.\n\nDavid Cole, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s legal director, said the order from Judge Ann M. Donnelly of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, which issued a nationwide injunction, was an important first step.\n\n\u201cMaking it stick will require both making sure that it\u2019s being followed at borders around the country and upholding it on appeal,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the government has released some plaintiffs in the four cases, others are being held while the cases move forward.\n\nOn Sunday, there were widespread reports that government officials at airports were not complying with aspects of the orders. That may have been a product of confusion and miscommunication, but some feared it was an early sign of a potential constitutional showdown.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe scariest scenario,\u201d said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, \u201cis one in which the Department of Homeland Security simply ignores the court orders. That would have been close to unimaginable in prior administrations. In this one, unfortunately, it would almost be unsurprising.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Schneiderman, sent a letter to federal officials Sunday demanding information about those held at John F. Kennedy International Airport after receiving what he called \u201calarming reports\u201d that the federal government was planning to violate the court order.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that the executive order was unconstitutional and that he and other attorneys general were exploring the possibility of legal action. \u201cThere may be grounds for a claim that this does damage to a state, if they\u2019re damaging our state institutions\u201d like universities and hospitals, he said.\n\nThe president has broad power to control immigration. A federal law allows him to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\u201d if he determines that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut another law appears to limit that power, saying that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s court orders, issued in haste, contained little reasoning. Judge Donnelly, in Brooklyn, wrote that there was a strong likelihood that the two plaintiffs in the case, who seek to represent a class of refugees, visa holders and others, could establish that their removal would violate the Constitution\u2019s due process and equal protection guarantees.\n\nBased on that conclusion and the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d the plaintiffs would suffer, Judge Donnelly issued a temporary nationwide injunction barring their removal. She did not order their release.\n\nThe order in Boston, from Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court there, was in one sense broader and in another narrower. It limited border screening practices to those in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and it barred not only removal but also detention. But it seemed to be limited to people arriving or held at Logan International Airport there.\n\nThe order from Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Federal District Court in Alexandria applied only to legal permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport. The order in Seattle, from Judge Thomas S. Zilly of the Federal District Court there, applied to two plaintiffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is possible that one of the four cases will definitively resolve an important aspect of the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. But the cases were filed very quickly, and civil rights litigators generally like to locate ideal plaintiffs and hone their legal theories before filing test cases that could turn into legal landmarks.\n\nThe Brooklyn case, for instance, did not make a claim based on the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, though some lawyers said that was the executive order\u2019s central flaw.\n\n\u201cThe smoking gun they put in the executive order is the idea that they would grant exceptions for minority religions,\u201d Mr. Romero said. Mr. Trump has said that was meant to favor Christians over Muslims.\n\nBut opening such a challenge requires preparation, Mr. Cole said.\n\n\u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t do under the establishment clause is denomination favoritism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very promising claim, but it requires the right plaintiff.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["long", "executive", "rulings", "path", "orders", "cases", "immigration", "judge", "court", "united", "trumps", "step", "federal", "order", "mr", "legal"], "summary": "In a statement issued early Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would comply with the court orders.\nDavid Cole, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s legal director, said the order from Judge Ann M.
