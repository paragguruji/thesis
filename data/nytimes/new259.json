The warrens of the State Department are unusually empty. Obama administration officials have packed up; new appointments have yet to be made. And a series of contradictory statements have emerged from cabinet officials about crucial issues \u2014 not least Russia.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump has continued to express his admiration for his counterpart in the Kremlin, Vladimir V. Putin. Yet Ms. Haley has taken a different posture. In both her confirmation hearing and in her first open remarks in the Security Council, she condemned Russia\u2019s \u201caggressive actions\u201d in Ukraine and insisted that United States sanctions on Moscow would remain.\n\nSeveral Western envoys breathed a sigh of relief, but not without doubts. Was she speaking for herself, or for the administration? Was the inconsistency deliberate, or did it reflect a lack of consensus? Who is setting United States policy, and whom should they be talking to?\n\n\u201cUnanswerable right now,\u201d advised Kathleen Hicks, a Pentagon official under President Barack Obama and now a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re smartest to have multiple points of entry. Backups to backups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Haley will have to weigh in on difficult, contentious issues that are already on the United Nations\u2019 agenda: how to save South Sudan from what could be a genocide, say, or whether to punish the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, for unleashing chemical weapons on his people, or how to stanch the spread of terrorism in West Africa.\n\nYet she has not expressed opinions on much. On Twitter, she posted selfies with her husband, Michael, and a YouTube video of Billy Joel singing \u201cNew York State of Mind.\u201d She admitted to being excited to see the movie \u201cDeepwater Horizon,\u201d and offered a new hashtag: #WeekendsInNYC.\n\nOn the last Sunday of January, as Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban left immigrants and refugees stranded across the world, Ms. Haley wrote a Twitter post about her husband driving up to New York with the family\u2019s pets, including two frogs and a fish.\n\nOn Saturday night, after North Korea tested a missile, Ms. Haley posted a Twitter message about her admiration for Joan Jett, the 1980s rock star.\n\nWhat kind of influence she may have on the White House remains unknown. She is far from being a confidante of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and it\u2019s unclear how much sway she will have over him on any of the big crises facing the world.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley will be a perfectly normal politician sent to be ambassador,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, a former Bush administration official. Mr. Trump, he warned, has \u201cinstincts and prejudices which are out of the norm of American diplomatic belief and practice.\u201d\n\nThe diplomatic corps is queuing up to see her \u2014 and those who score face time are wasting no time sharing it. \u201cThe #SpecialRelationship comes to @UN,\u201d the British ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, posted on Twitter, along with a photo of the two of them shoulder to shoulder.\n\n\u201cVery positive meeting,\u201d offered the Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, posting a picture of his own.\n\nAt a crowded reception one recent evening, one diplomat described the first weeks of the Trump presidency as \u201csurreal,\u201d as though he were describing a Luis Bu\u00f1uel movie. Then he spotted Ms. Haley and deftly snaked through the crowd to introduce himself.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI spoke to more than a dozen diplomats for this article, and nearly all described Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, as a natural politician and a refreshing contrast to the president. \u201cCordial,\u201d one envoy said. \u201cBusinesslike,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way to engage with the new administration, particularly with Ambassador Haley, and to explore with them what we can do together,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, the envoy representing the European Union\u2019s 28 member nations. \u201cIn doing so, we should try to avoid dangers and pitfalls.\u201d\n\nVitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador and perhaps Ms. Haley\u2019s most important colleague on the Council, complimented her \u201cvery powerful record\u201d as governor. On Twitter, he said cryptically that he looked forward to working with her according to the \u201cmind-set of their capitals.\u201d (Her boss, in Washington, has lavished praise on his, in Moscow.)\n\nFew people at the United Nations need to be on her good list more than the man who heads the world body, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\nMr. Trump has dismissed Mr. Guterres\u2019s entire operation as a social club. Republicans in Congress have threatened to pull funding. And Ms. Haley has made it clear that she intends to scrutinize how the United Nations spends its money and eliminate things that do not serve United States interests, while also taking pains to say she would not take a \u201cslash and burn\u201d approach.\n\nThe United States pays for more than a fifth of the United Nations\u2019 core budget, and controls key jobs in the world body\u2019s system. So Mr. Guterres must strike a balance between keeping United States officials on board and not being seen as subservient to United States interests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe faced that challenge over Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. Mr. Guterres was criticized as not speaking out against it directly enough, quickly enough. Finally, he told reporters that the restrictions \u201cviolate our basic principles\u201d and called for them to be discontinued.\n\nMr. Guterres is a former socialist prime minister of Portugal. Ms. Haley is a conservative from the American South. But both are politicians, as Richard Gowan, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out. And, he argued, they could help each other \u2014 Ms. Haley in prodding him to show that America gets value at the United Nations, Mr. Guterres by using pressure from her to make the reforms he thinks are necessary.\n\nAs Mr. Gowan put it in a recent essay, \u201cTheir political fortunes are inseparable.\u201d", "authors": ["Somini Sengupta"], "publish_date": "2017-02-12", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["ambassador", "world", "trump", "bridge", "united", "states", "twitter", "trumps", "diplomats", "ms", "haley", "nations", "seeking", "mr", "look", "worlds"], "summary": "Yet Ms. Haley has taken a different posture.\nWho is setting United States policy, and whom should they be talking to?\nThen he spotted Ms. Haley and deftly snaked through the crowd to introduce himself.\nSo Mr. Guterres must strike a balance between keeping United States officials on board and not being seen as subservient to United States interests.\nMs. Haley is a conservative from the American South."}
