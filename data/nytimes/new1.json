She told Congress this month that she saw no honest argument to make in defense of the ban.\n\nShe said she grappled with whether to resign, as some have argued that she should have done. She told colleagues that quitting would only punt a difficult decision to her successor.\n\n\u201cI believed then, and believe now, that resigning would have protected my personal integrity, but it would not have protected the integrity of the Department of Justice,\u201d she said. The department is not \u201cjust another law firm, and this wasn\u2019t just any legal issue.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lynch, attorney general in the Obama administration \u2014 had been changing the trajectory of the country and the world.\n\nTaking a risk \u201cmeans that you have to be willing to be wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that can sometimes be a lonely place to be. But I\u2019m hoping that fear of being wrong won\u2019t keep you from acting.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause inaction, doing nothing, or simply going along, that\u2019s a decision, too. and it seems the times in my life that I haven\u2019t acted that\u2019s when I\u2019ve regretted it the most.\u201d\n\nShe advised the graduates not to take the safe course. In what seemed to be a veiled swipe at her former boss, the president, she said: \u201cDoing your job means you are not simply a reflection of someone else\u2019s talents or opinions. You\u2019re the person to whom a leader turns when he or she needs to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump fired Ms. Yates 10 days into his administration after she ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend his first immigration order suspending entry to the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries as well as for refugees.\n\nMs. Yates\u2019s order was a remarkable rebuke by a government official of a sitting president and came at the end of a turbulent three days that began with Mr. Trump\u2019s signing of his executive order. The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Yates said her determination in deciding not to defend the order included questions not only about the order\u2019s lawfulness, but also of whether it was a \u201cwise or just\u201d policy.", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"], "publish_date": "2017-05-24", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["main", "trump", "defied", "sally", "tells", "harvard", "justice", "department", "ms", "reading", "yates", "order", "president", "students", "law", "legal"], "summary": "\u201cThis was the first we had even heard of it,\u201d Ms. Yates said of the ban.\nWithin hours, the Justice Department was going to have to defend the executive order in courts around the country.\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s illustrative of an unexpected moment where the law and conscience intersected,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Justice Department normally defends presidential action by default, and the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel declared the ban legal.\nBut Ms. Yates said that narrow analysis did not consider the president\u2019s own words, which described the ban explicitly in terms of religion."}
