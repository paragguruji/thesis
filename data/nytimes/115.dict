By early Sunday morning, Ms. Fisher said, lawyers offering services and advice were at \u201cmost international airports in the United States.\u201d\n\nAndre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was \u201centirely taken over by attorneys,\u201d all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cThere were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together,\u201d Mr. Segura said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that immediate coming together of teams to start filing actions to try to protect people.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe dynamic between what was happening inside the terminal with all the attorneys, and outside with massive protests and people holding signs \u2014 I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Segura said he arrived home around 2 a.m. on Sunday. He woke up at 5:30 and began answering emails from lawyers who had stayed overnight at the airport.\n\nWhile lawyers gathered at airports on Saturday, others were working furiously on litigation. Cecillia Wang, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s deputy legal director, described the scene at her office as \u201ccomplete chaos.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was sitting at my desk working on a template habeas petition that could be used by lawyers at airports all around the country,\u201d she said.\n\nOmar Jadwat, the director of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Immigrant Rights Project, which worked on the petition that led to the judge\u2019s stay, said the litigation had not been prepared ahead of time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Das, who said she could not comment on her client\u2019s situation, described the scene on Sunday morning, saying that it was \u201cincredibly difficult to get an answer on whether our clients were going to be sent back or whether they were being processed for release\u201d and that people remained detained even after the court order blocked part of the president\u2019s actions.\n\nAvi Gesser, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, described the process in Terminal 4 on Saturday, saying that a group of people had been deployed to search for those whose family members were detained.\n\n\u201cIf they found people, they referred them over to us and we onboarded people as clients if we could, and then filed habeas petitions,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gesser, who is originally from Canada, did not leave the airport until 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he said.\n\n\u201cOur firm has a lot of people who were not born in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that people who were being detained needed legal representation. And that\u2019s something that we do very well.\u201d\n\nRebecca Heller, who was coordinating lawyers\u2019 efforts on the ground for the International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday, said that by Sunday afternoon, her services were far less in demand.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re self-organizing now!\u201d she said excitedly in a brief phone call. \u201cThat\u2019s how a movement starts.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Jonah Engel Bromwich", "type": "article"}
