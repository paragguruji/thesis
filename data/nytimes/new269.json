He did not put a bumper sticker on his car, for fear it would be keyed. The only place he felt comfortable wearing his Make America Great Again hat was on a vacation in China. Even dating became difficult. Many people on Tinder have a warning on their profile: \u201cTrump supporters swipe left\u201d \u2014 meaning, get lost.\n\nHe came out a few days before the election. On election night, a friend posted on Facebook, \u201cYou are a disgusting human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were making me want to support him more with how irrational they were being,\u201d Mr. Youngquist said.\n\nConservatives have gotten vicious, too, sometimes with Mr. Trump\u2019s encouragement. But if political action is meant to persuade people that Mr. Trump is bad for the country, then people on the fence would seem a logical place to start. Yet many seemingly persuadable conservatives say that liberals are burning bridges rather than building them.\n\n\u201cWe are in a trust spiral,\u201d said Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University. \u201cMy fear is that we have reached escape velocity where the actions of each side can produce such strong reactions on the other that things will continue to escalate.\u201d\n\nIt is tempting to blame Mr. Trump for America\u2019s toxic political state of mind. He has wreaked havoc on political civility and is putting American democratic institutions through the most robust stress test in decades. But many experts argue that he is a symptom, not a cause, and that the roots go deeper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

That period was far more violent but culminated in a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in 1972, after he famously appealed to the \u201csilent majority,\u201d who he believed resented what they saw as disrespect for American institutions. Others say that democracy was far healthier then and that you have to go farther back to find a historical parallel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is really only one period that was analogous, and that is the Civil War and its immediate aftermath,\u201d said Doug McAdam, a Stanford sociology professor. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting we are there, but we are straining our institutions more than we really ever have before.\u201d\n\nOne facet of recent political life has been large-scale protests against Mr. Trump. They have been largely peaceful, but when there is violence, even on the fringes, it tends to reduce popular support for them, Professor Haidt said, citing recent research. And for many Trump voters, even peaceful protests are unsettling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with protesting as long as it\u2019s peaceful, but this is destroying the country,\u201d said Ann O\u2019Connell, 72, a retired administrative assistant in Syracuse who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI feel like we are in some kind of civil war right now. I know people don\u2019t like to use those terms. But I think it\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nMrs. O\u2019Connell is a registered Democrat. She voted for Bill Clinton twice. But she has drifted away from the party over what she said was a move from its middle-class economic roots toward identity politics. She remembers Mr. Clinton giving a speech about the dangers of illegal immigration. Mr. Trump was lambasted for offering some of the same ideas, she said.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has changed so much that I don\u2019t even recognize it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are destroying our democracy. They are scarier to me than these Islamic terrorists. I feel absolutely disgusted with them and their antics. It strengthens people\u2019s resolve in wanting to support President Trump. It really does.\u201d\n\nPolling data suggest many center-right voters feel the same way. The first poll by the Pew Research Center on presidential job performance since Mr. Trump took office showed last week that while he has almost no support from Democrats, he has high marks among moderates who lean Republican: 70 percent approve, while 20 percent disapprove.\n\nMr. Medford compares Mr. Trump to a jalopy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I need to get from Charleston to Atlanta, and suddenly the most beat-up car on earth shows up and says, \u2018Do you need a ride?\u2019 I think, wow, if I had any other way to get there, I\u2019d choose it. But there\u2019s only this terrible car. And it might not even make it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to get out, at least not yet, and the resignation of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, hasn\u2019t changed that. Late last year, he hit it off with a woman in New York he met online. They spent hours on the phone. They made plans for him to visit. But when he mentioned he had voted for Mr. Trump, she said she was embarrassed and didn\u2019t know if she wanted him to come. (He eventually did, but she lied to her friends about his visiting.)\n\n\u201cIt invalidated anything that\u2019s good about me, just because of how I voted. Poof, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nMrs. O\u2019Connell feels hopeless. She has deleted all her news feeds on Facebook and she tries to watch less TV. But politics keeps seeping in.\n\n\u201cI love Meryl Streep, but you know, she robbed me of that wonderful feeling when I go to the movies to be entertained,\u201d she said. \u201cI told my husband, I said, \u2018Ed, we have to be a little more flexible, or we\u2019re going to run out of movies!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs for the country, she is worried.\n\n\u201cChange doesn\u2019t occur until you hit rock bottom, like an alcoholic, on his knees, begging for help,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we still have farther to go.\u201d", "authors": ["Sabrina Tavernise"], "publish_date": "2017-02-18", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["voted", "trump", "liberals", "political", "youngquist", "support", "think", "helping", "war", "continue", "york", "mr"], "summary": "\u201cThey are complaining that Trump calls people names, but they turned into some mean people.\u201dMr. Youngquist stayed in the closet for months about his support for Mr. Trump.\nBut if political action is meant to persuade people that Mr. Trump is bad for the country, then people on the fence would seem a logical place to start.\nMr. Trump was lambasted for offering some of the same ideas, she said.\nMr. Medford compares Mr. Trump to a jalopy.\nBut when he mentioned he had voted for Mr. Trump, she said she was embarrassed and didn\u2019t know if she wanted him to come."}
