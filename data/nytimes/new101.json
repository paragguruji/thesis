Last year, only 10,000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40,000 in Canada.\n\nMs. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day.\n\nNow, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple\u2019s 2-year-old daughter could be heard playing in the background.\n\n\u201cWe are so, so, so sad,\u201d Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. \u201cThe process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn\u2019t live the application steps in all its difficulties.\u201d\n\nStrictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur; they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world\u2019s \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump\u2019s proscribed list.\n\nPhoto\n\nLaith al-Samari, 37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from anti-American militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg.\n\n\u201cPlease Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us.\u201d\n\nMustafa, the 28-year-old Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: \u201cI made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a high-end Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. \u201cI would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn\u2019t take anything else with me, not even my memories,\u201d he said.\n\nMustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why \u2014 like most of the refugees interviewed for this article \u2014 he did not want his full name published.\n\n\u201cIf I do get rejected,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d regret ever having shaken hands with an American.\u201d He struggled not to weep.\n\nSardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief.\n\nHe said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7,000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe were given a commitment to go there,\u201d he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam.\n\nFiras al-Swiha, 23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital.\n\nHe was still looking for answers.\n\n\u201cIs Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?\u201d he asked. \u201cISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one.\u201d\n\nSara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats \u2014 the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television \u2014 was trying to arrive at answers of her own.\n\n\u201cYou just wait,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting.\u201d\n\nAfter three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly.\n\nNow her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration\u2019s much-reduced refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted.\n\n\u201cThe bitter truth,\u201d she said, \u201cis that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn\u2019t have even the slightest idea what it\u2019s like to live as a refugee.\u201d", "authors": ["Rod Nordland", "Joe Cochrane", "Patrick Kingsley"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["dreams", "verge", "world", "trump", "coming", "refugee", "turkey", "die", "united", "door", "states", "trumps", "resettlement", "syria", "reading", "refugees", "closes"], "summary": "For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week.\n\u201cWe are so, so, so sad,\u201d Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown.\nMany thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it.\nA former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from anti-American militants in his Baghdad community.\nFiras al-Swiha, 23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment."}
