There was already a sense that future visits would be fraught with political anxiety.\n\n\u201cWords cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow,\u201d the Cleveland player Richard Jefferson wrote on Snapchat. His teammate LeBron James publicly supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.\n\nWhen the New England Patriots visited the White House in April, 34 players attended, according to the team. Two years earlier, when Obama was president, about 50 players made the visit, the Patriots said.\n\nThe Clemson football team was honored at the White House on Monday for its national championship in January.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Kerr\u2019s father, Malcolm, was president of the American University of Beirut when he was assassinated outside his office in 1984. A group calling itself Islamic Holy War claimed responsibility later that day. Courts later found that Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah was behind the killing.\n\nKerr has been critical of American foreign policy in the Middle East, and he called Trump\u2019s proposed travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries \u201ca horrible idea.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going against the principles of what our country\u2019s about,\u201d Kerr told reporters in January. \u201cAnd creating fear, it\u2019s the wrong way to go about it.\u201d\n\nKerr, much like his mentor Gregg Popovich, coach of the San Antonio Spurs, has become a strong voice on social and political issues, especially over the past two years. Kerr used the opportunity to thank Obama for pushing for tighter gun control regulations.\n\nTrump has been the target of some of his toughest criticism.\n\n\u201cThe modern coach has to be much more communicative, flexible, aware, conscientious, all those things,\u201d Kerr told Sports Illustrated this spring. \u201cFrankly, I think it\u2019s why Trump couldn\u2019t be more ill-suited to be president, because he\u2019s a blowhard.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-06-13", "authors": "John Branch", "type": "article"}
