But the largest crowdfunding site, GoFundMe, and a company it recently acquired, CrowdRise, have seen more than 50 new campaigns that have raised nearly $1.5 million related to the executive order, which halted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. An appeals court in San Francisco is reviewing the order.\n\nPhoto\n\nYouCaring, a smaller GoFundMe competitor, is also hosting several campaigns, including one that has raised nearly $7,000 for a Syrian woman who had been approved to resettle in Little Rock, Ark. A British site, CrowdJustice, sped up its opening in the United States after Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. The first American campaign on the site raised $36,000 to pay for the lawyers of two Yemeni brothers who were deported after arriving at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\n\nIn just the last few years, crowdfunding has increasingly become a regular part of the public response to humanitarian crises like floods, mass shootings or, in this case, the fallout from a presidential order.\n\nGoFundMe has, on its own, helped attract more than $3.4 billion in donations from 30 million donors since it was founded in 2010 \u2014 more than what has been pledged on well-known crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, which focus more on helping entrepreneurs and artists.\n\n\u201cWe are the social safety net for everyone who falls through the cracks,\u201d said Rob Solomon, the chief executive of GoFundMe, which is based in Redwood City, just south of San Francisco. \u201cNo matter how great the NGOs and government agencies are, a lot of people will fall through the cracks.\u201d\n\nGoFundMe takes 5 percent of the funds raised for administrative fees and an additional 2.9 percent for credit card processing. It defends the fees by pointing to the costs involved in maintaining the site, and building systems for vetting potential fund-raising campaigns. YouCaring charges 3 percent for credit card processing.\n\nThese campaigns have been dogged by questions about whether they represent the most efficient way to get money to people in need of help. Existing charities have complained that crowdfunding has siphoned money to the saddest personal stories, as opposed to the established institutions that provide broad support after emergencies. The sites have also faced criticism over their level of oversight to ensure that money ends up where it is supposed to go.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEthan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied crowdfunding, said the individual nature of the campaigns could lower the level of accountability around spending.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Eric Martinez and Jen Thorson, the founders of the company Modjoul, realized that their employee Nazanin Zinouri, a recent Ph.D. graduate of Clemson University, was trapped in her native Iran, they set up a GoFundMe page with a $30,000 goal to help get her back, and were met with criticism over what some users of the site perceived as a very high figure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already raised $12,000 in 2 mere days, what is that for?\u201d a user, under the name Kimba Essence, asked in a post last week. \u201cWhere is the disclosure on what you are doing with $12,000?\u201d\n\nMr. Martinez said that people were underestimating the costs \u2014 not just for all the international cellphone calls, printing bills for legal filings and the $3,200 for same-day flights from Tehran to Frankfurt to Boston, but also for an immigration lawyer to work on her case in what was expected to be a protracted legal battle. Also anticipated: months of car and rent payments while she waited without a job to get back into the country. (She made it back this past Sunday.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

After someone on Twitter told the actor and former White House employee Kal Penn, \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in this country,\u201d he went on CrowdRise and asked for $2,500 for the International Rescue Committee. He ended up raising over $800,000.\n\nLawyers in Dallas, who set up a \u201cwar room\u201d at the local airport to help detained travelers, raised $34,000 to pay for the expenses associated with the operation. Another $25,000 was raised for a Yemeni girl separated from her family.\n\nMr. Mollick said the sites had been a promising new venue for fund-raising because they allow for a wider array of innovative approaches to emergencies, in ways that offer donors a more personal sense of investment.\n\n\u201cThe crowd tends to select a greater variety of things, things that can be really good or really bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWith expert money, you tend to get the same result every time.\u201d", "authors": ["Nicholas Kulish", "Nathaniel Popper"], "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "upended", "helps", "raised", "site", "ban", "international", "rescue", "martinez", "crowdfunding", "campaigns", "refugees", "help", "sites", "gofundme", "money"], "summary": "A British site, CrowdJustice, sped up its opening in the United States after Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.\nThe first American campaign on the site raised $36,000 to pay for the lawyers of two Yemeni brothers who were deported after arriving at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\nIt defends the fees by pointing to the costs involved in maintaining the site, and building systems for vetting potential fund-raising campaigns.\nExisting charities have complained that crowdfunding has siphoned money to the saddest personal stories, as opposed to the established institutions that provide broad support after emergencies.\n\u201cThe crowd tends to select a greater variety of things, things that can be really good or really bad,\u201d he said."}
