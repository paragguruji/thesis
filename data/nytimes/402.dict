There are good rules and there are dumb ones. Governments aren\u2019t all-knowing and markets aren\u2019t flawlessly self-regulating. Over- and under-regulation are both real problems. This is common sense to most of us and shouldn\u2019t descend into a stereotyped left-right debate.\n\nAnd another thing: Theresa May\u2019s gotta go. My feelings about her are approaching yours about Joe Lieberman.\n\nGail: Wow, that\u2019s very bad news for Theresa May.\n\nWe\u2019re in agreement about good rules/bad rules. I have fond memories of the Clinton administration\u2019s war on government inefficiency. Al Gore had his little hammer .\u2026 Ah, those were the days.\n\nThere are some things that will work out if you just let the free markets take care of themselves like, um, popular music. But there are others that won\u2019t. And their number is legion, from building safety to \u2026 health care.\n\nBret: Building safety is a core responsibility of government, assuming it\u2019s competently and honestly executed. I lived through a horrific earthquake in Mexico City in 1985, which at the time had some of the most stringent building codes in the world. They didn\u2019t help because too many buildings, including dozens of public schools and hospitals, had been cheaply built in violation of the codes. Rules are good only if they are sensible, affordable \u2014 and enforced.\n\nGail: I would barge in here and point out that good enforcement requires government funding, but that\u2019d just be cranky. Plus it\u2019s your turn. Go on.\n\nBret: On health care, the libertarian conceit that health care is just another marketplace where consumers can make their own choices according to their own tastes and budgets, as they might at Whole Foods or Walmart, is silly. The real problem is that, as with buildings, it\u2019s hard to define the upper limit of how much safety \u2014 or health \u2014 we want, especially when it comes at the expense of other goods: affordability, availability, experimentation, innovation and so on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNotice I\u2019m avoiding the elephant in this chamber, so to speak.\n\nGail: How did you feel about that government-efficiency order Trump signed calling for doing away with two regulations every time a new one was implemented? I\u2019m stacking the deck here, given that it was based on a British model that could well have been one of the reasons there was no rule on retrofitting apartment sprinklers.\n\nBret: I liked that executive order \u2014 one of the very few things for which I\u2019ve ever praised Trump. Maybe it\u2019s Procrustean, but I\u2019m hard-pressed to think there weren\u2019t two outdated U.K. regulations that could have been retired for the sake of installing fire sprinklers in older housing projects. The license fee for the privilege of watching TV in black-and-white, for instance?\n\nGail: You may have more faith in bureaucracy than I do. I wouldn\u2019t want to bet everything on officials having the energy to change the status quo and retract two rules that somebody somewhere probably has a stake in keeping on the books.\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking rules, I want to ask you about one in Obamacare. It requires most people to buy health insurance or face tax penalties, and it\u2019s possibly the thing Republicans hate most in the entire program.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Mitt Romney used to say that all the time \u2014 at least back when he was governor.\n\nBret: The conservative answer would be that it\u2019s an infringement on liberty to require people to purchase a product they don\u2019t want; and that it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m more persuaded by the second point than the first, since it\u2019s also an infringement on my liberty to have to subsidize, through my tax dollars, the bad choices of others. In Massachusetts, what was once \u201cRomneycare\u201d has mainly amounted, as a good op-ed essay in The Boston Globe pointed out last year, to a near doubling of Medicaid enrollees, declines in the number of people with employer-provided insurance and more than a doubling of costs.\n\nI know everyone wants to pile on when it comes to the G.O.P. health bills. But I haven\u2019t really seen my liberal friends come to terms with the fact that Obamacare was leading private insurers to pull out of Obamacare exchanges in one state after another, while Medicare premiums kept going up.\n\nGail: This liberal friend would say that Obamacare could quickly be repaired if the two sides worked together on it. It would still be a deeply imperfect program, of course. (Listen and you will hear the trees whispering, \u201cSingle-payer option!\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut about requiring everyone to have health insurance: It\u2019s the only possible way you can have a plan that allows people with pre-existing conditions to buy coverage. Otherwise they can just coast while they\u2019re healthy and opt in when they\u2019re looking at large bills.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re committed as a nation to providing emergency health care to all \u2014 I believe our current president came out very strongly against letting people \u201cdie in the streets.\u201d And it\u2019s a crushing burden for hospitals when the people come into ER.s uninsured.\n\nThe most sensible answer is to have national health care for all. But if that isn\u2019t going to fly I think part of being an adult citizen should be having at least adequate health insurance to pay for a crisis. Otherwise, we\u2019re \u2026 encouraging spongers.\n\nBret: For those of us on the conservative side of politics, the chief problem of the Senate bill is that it is basically an Obamacare rescue package, as Philip Klein pointed out in The Washington Examiner. The Senate bill promises a lot of spending in the next three or four years to sustain Medicaid\u2019s current expansion. The spending is pared only after that, which is to say, sometime during the Warren-Booker administration (or is that Harris-Sanders?). Which is all another way of saying, it\u2019s never going to happen. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so skeptical of the whole G.O.P. exercise.\n\nI suspect you\u2019re going to get your wish for single payer, sooner or later. Even if the G.O.P. bill goes through, it won\u2019t survive the eventual Democratic wave election, whenever it hits. And to me single payer sounds like a lousy outcome: a two-tier system in which middle-class Americans get lower-quality medicine while the fortunate few maintain access to expensive private clinics.\n\nBy the way, what\u2019s your read on Supreme Court ruling in the travel ban case?\n\nGail: I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a big deal in terms of the actual consequences, but this whole thing was born out of a clear, specific attempt to discriminate against one religion, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, any piece of it is still tainted.\n\nBret: Uh-oh, we\u2019re back to agreeing about something. The whole thing stinks. The stated purpose of the travel ban was to give the government three or four months to deal with supposed gaps in vetting procedures. On those grounds alone the executive order is moot. Then the court split the baby, upholding the ban only with respect to foreigners with no \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with someone in the United States. But who\u2019s going to figure out what\u2019s a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d? And then there\u2019s the larger point that this is unmistakably a Muslim ban, awkwardly tailored to pass constitutional muster.\n\nI hope Justices John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy consider what will happen when they rule in the administration\u2019s favor \u2014 only to see Trump gloat over his \u201cMuslim ban\u201d in a tweet the morning after the ruling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGail: Speaking of tweets, you wrote a great column last week announcing that you were giving up twittering, except for occasions when you wanted to say something nice.\n\nWelcome to the non-tweeting tribe! I have to admit my two reasons for pretty much avoiding Twitter are 1) fear of saying something really stupid and 2) fear of having it turn into another occupation. Yours seem much more elevated. How\u2019s it been going?\n\nBret: I gave one last parting glance at the Twitter reaction, much of it obscene, to the column, and it made me feel that much better about the decision. Twitter is supposed to be just another communications tool, and in theory it has its uses. In practice, it has a way of turning its users into jerks. And yes, God save you (or me), from tweeting something impulsively and then regretting it for the rest of the week.\n\nAt the risk of being self-congratulatory, let me just say that part of what we\u2019re trying to do with these conversations is model a certain kind of discourse \u2014 disagreement minus nastiness \u2014 that we could all use a little more of. Now, did I mention that your readers are demented morons if they think Betsy DeVos is the worst member of the cabinet?\n\nGail: Ah, the beat goes on. See you after our Independence Day vacation next week, Bret. And meanwhile, if you can\u2019t tweet something nice about somebody, don\u2019t tweet anything at all.", "publish_date": "2017-06-27", "authors": "Gail Collins and Bret Stephens", "type": "article"}
