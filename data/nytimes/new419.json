On the eve of their flight, word came that their travel had been canceled because one member\u2019s medical exam had expired.\n\n\u201cPeople like this family are completely out of luck because they have no U.S. relatives,\u201d said Angie Plummer, the executive director of Community Refugee and Immigration Services, an Ohio resettlement agency. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when, or if, they will arrive.\u201d\n\nEven for the Mwendas, the joy of reaching the United States is tempered by the pain of leaving a loved one behind. John Feruzi, 21, a nephew raised since infancy by Mr. Mwenda and his wife, Nyasa Safi, fled with them to Malawi but was not allowed to travel to the United States for reasons that remain unclear. A nephew does not qualify as a close relative under the State Department\u2019s definition, so it was thought that he would probably not be able to join the rest of his family for at least four months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLate Thursday, a federal judge in Hawaii ruled that nephews, grandparents, uncles and other relatives should qualify. It was not immediately clear when Mr. Feruzi would be allowed to join his family.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe are very happy to be here, but we are not complete,\u201d said Mr. Mwenda\u2019s son Byaombe Mwenda, 23, his eyes welling up with tears as he described Mr. Feruzi as a brother. \u201cWe have never lived without him.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in the fall about whether the president\u2019s executive order temporarily barring all refugees and all travelers from six majority-Muslim countries unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims. The Trump administration says the order is a legal exercise of the president\u2019s national security powers and necessary to ensure that everyone entering the country is properly vetted.\n\nRefugees like the Mwendas already undergo extensive background checks, and it is extremely rare for any of them to engage in terrorist behavior. But supporters of the president point to a small number of cases in which immigrants or their children have become radicalized. A number of young men in Minnesota from Somali refugee families have been convicted of plotting to join militant groups, including the Islamic State.\n\nWhile the court awaits the arguments, it has allowed the travel ban to take effect for those without \u201cbona fide\u201d ties to the United States, the foreigners who the justices said were least likely to win legal protection.\n\nPhoto\n\nKnowing no one in the United States, the Mwendas have relied on an Arkansas affiliate of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. It worked with local churches to help them set up a couple of apartments in Fayetteville, center of a prosperous region that is home to the University of Arkansas and the corporate headquarters of Walmart.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The fighters then kidnapped Mr. Mwenda.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rest of the family \u2014 Mr. Mwenda\u2019s wife, eight other children and two grandchildren \u2014 fled to another village. They assumed Mr. Mwenda was dead until word arrived that he had been tortured and dumped on a roadside, discovered alive by missionaries who hospitalized him.\n\nThe family reunited, and traveled for four days across Lake Tanganyika and through Tanzania to reach the Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi. There they joined thousands of refugees fleeing genocide, violence and war in Congo, Somalia, Burundi and Sudan.\n\n\u201cWe had no documents, no nothing; we had left everything behind,\u201d Mr. Mwenda recalled, noting that they had \u201cjust a little money.\u201d\n\nThe family built an adobe hut that would be their home for seven years. The children, who spoke mostly Swahili, enrolled in school, where they studied English.\n\nTo supplement the rations of corn and beans provided by the United Nations, Mr. Mwenda started a business selling timber to fellow refugees who needed wood to mount tarps over their shacks. He rented trucks and headed for the woods with his older sons, where they spent three or four days at a time chopping trees.\n\nIn June 2016, after completing interviews and security checks, the family was notified that it would be resettled in the United States.\n\nFamily members celebrated when the American authorities informed them in early January that their departure was imminent. Everyone, including Mr. Feruzi, Mr. Mwenda\u2019s nephew, completed medical exams, one of the last steps in the process.\n\nThe Mwendas checked a United States map to see where they would be living. \u201cWe had never heard of Arkansas,\u201d said Jules Mwenda, 24, reciting the names of big cities and states he knew.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the end of a 20-hour journey, the Mwendas arrived last week at Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport to a gaggle of well-wishers hoisting American flags and welcome-home signs.\n\nThe local resettlement agency, Canopy of Northwest Arkansas, arranged for church groups to take the Mwendas on their first outings. In the produce section of a grocery store, Mr. Mwenda was bewildered by the abundance and wide variety of apples on display, promptly plopping two dozen pricey Pink Ladies into a bag. His sons were taken aback by the pet food aisle, and the idea that food would be manufactured specifically for cats.\n\nBack at their apartments, they had to learn how to use the oven, the toaster and the toilet. None had ever lived in a place where they could flush.\n\nThey hope to soon find work, in the poultry, food service, construction or retail sectors. \u201cI want to work and study to be an electrician,\u201d said Jules, the eldest son.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mwenda, who still suffers from searing pain in his right leg from the torture he endured in 2009, will see a doctor.\n\n\u201cLife will get better here with time,\u201d Mr. Mwenda said on Monday as his wife prepared a lunch of beef stew, corn meal and rice. \u201cThis country is very organized.\u201d\n\nLater, on a WhatsApp call, they spoke with the nephew they had to leave behind, who has already been fingerprinted, photographed, interviewed and medically cleared. \u201cI am ready to leave even today,\u201d Mr. Feruzi said.", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"], "publish_date": "2017-07-13", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["family", "wife", "mwenda", "refugee", "refugees", "united", "door", "shuts", "feruzi", "states", "arrives", "mr", "arkansas", "mwendas"], "summary": "It was not immediately clear when Mr. Feruzi would be allowed to join his family.\nPhotoKnowing no one in the United States, the Mwendas have relied on an Arkansas affiliate of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe rest of the family \u2014 Mr. Mwenda\u2019s wife, eight other children and two grandchildren \u2014 fled to another village.\nIn June 2016, after completing interviews and security checks, the family was notified that it would be resettled in the United States.\nEveryone, including Mr. Feruzi, Mr. Mwenda\u2019s nephew, completed medical exams, one of the last steps in the process."}
