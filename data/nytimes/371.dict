{"title": "Opinion | \u2018This Wasn\u2019t a Speech About Islam\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/opinion/this-wasnt-a-speech-about-islam.html?mcubz=0", "text": "A \u201cspeech on Islam\u201d could have included some references to the faith, an acknowledgment that Islam is a great religion with values in common with Judeo-Christianity, and with a history of pluralism and tolerance. A \u201cspeech on Muslims\u201d could have also been richer, with perhaps examples of how Muslims have contributed to the world, including to American society. This was a more modest, narrow and pragmatic speech, mostly appealing to Muslim leaders \u2014 in fact, only Sunni ones \u2014 for more cooperation against terrorism. But given Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier views on Islam, it could have been worse!\n\nWajahat: Yes, I was curious about which Trump we would see: the same Trump who advanced a Muslim ban and said \u201cI think Islam hates us\u201d; or the pragmatic realist who gladly participates in the Saudi sword dance, curtsies for King Salman for an award, and jettisons all the \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d talk in a country that he said was the world\u2019s biggest funder of terrorism.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that Trump repeatedly mocked Saudi Arabia throughout the campaign. During his third debate with Hillary Clinton last October, he scolded her: \u201cYou talk about women and women\u2019s rights. These are people that push gays off business \u2014 off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly, and yet you take their money.\u201d Well, he just signed several lucrative deals with the Saudis.\n\nVideo\n\nMustafa: Trump seems willing to take a realpolitik approach that\u2019s unconcerned with the \u201cdomestic affairs\u201d of other nations, including human rights violations. This is music to the ears of most iron-fisted leaders, including those in the Middle East. In Turkey, there\u2019s another important speech today: by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is formally assuming back the leadership of this party. Pro-Erdogan conservatives in Turkey, who would normally be offended by Trump\u2019s statements on Islam, love him out of a kind of loyalty to a \u201cpopulist alliance,\u201d so they don\u2019t criticize him.\n\nWajahat: Mustafa, I think we can agree that one consistency for a thoroughly inconsistent Trump presidency is his love affair for authoritarian leaders: Erdogan in Turkey, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, and now the Saudi royal family.\n\nThis is, I believe, one of the most troubling aspects of this speech and the shift in American policy under Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 a complete abandoning of even paying lip service to civil liberties, free press, human rights. Our foreign policy no longer seems guided by even the pretense of these American values. We know that governments like Saudi Arabia and Egypt use terrorism as an excuse to crack down on all opposition and political participation. (Look at the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, for example.) And we know that a lack of economic opportunities, political freedoms and human rights are what create conditions for extremism to thrive in Middle East. Oh, the irony!\n\nMustafa: That is all true. But to his credit, Trump put this realpolitik in an acceptable format: \u201cWe are not here to lecture.\u201d That sounds good to a lot of people in the Middle East. Sometimes Western preaching of human rights, when it\u2019s wrapped up in self-righteousness, can backfire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, the current alternative \u2014 a United States that says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about what autocracies do to their people, as long as they serve my interests\u201d \u2014 is really bad for the world. It is even bad for the United States\u2019 interests in the long run.\n\nWajahat: Trump said he was in Saudi Arabia to \u201coffer partnership based on shared interests and values.\u201d Well, what do you see as the shared interests and values for the United States and the Saudis since we seem to agree that clearly it isn\u2019t human rights?\n\nMustafa: The \u201cshared interests and values\u201d in this case seem to be twofold: Let\u2019s fight the terrorists, like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. And let\u2019s do business. None of these are wrong, of course. But there is also the problem of human rights violations in regimes such as that of Saudi Arabia \u2014 or Egypt, or elsewhere. As I understand, Trump\u2019s message is, \u201cwe don\u2019t care about that part.\u201d But is this what the United States really stands for? It is up to the American people, of course, but I would hope to see some more aspiration to help make the world a better place.\n\nVideo\n\nMustafa: I will say, though, that there were things I liked in Trump\u2019s speech. I appreciated that he pointed out that Muslims have borne the brunt of the pain and death and murder. And that 90 percent of terrorism\u2019s victims are Muslim. It\u2019s a point that Obama also made, but it\u2019s a good one, and Trump\u2019s base might not have been aware of it. He also mentioned the suffering of Christians, which is a very serious and important issue in the region.\n\nWajahat: It was great to seeing so many women at the speech, right? O.K., pardon the sarcasm. This might seem harsh but viewing the optics of this entire surreal weekend I call it a beautiful marriage of ugly hypocrisy. There\u2019s opulence, wealth, sword dances, halal meat, bling, jets, fawning and courtship. Yet both sides, Trump and Saudi, are perfectly able and willing to jettison their alleged positions, as defenders of American values and \u201cSunni Islam,\u201d for the sake of advancing selfish personal and political agendas.\n\nMustafa: Again, I will be the optimist here. It is actually helpful, in my view, that American people, especially those who voted for Trump, see their president and his family happily hanging out with all the images they may typically see as scary: Arabic inscriptions on green flags, recitation of the Quran, Arab men with swords,\n\nFor merely visual purposes, it is better that Trump appears in this conservative Muslim setting, rather than staying away from it.\n\nWajahat: Here\u2019s to low bars and even lower expectations! Believe me, I am also an optimist. I have babies so it\u2019s obligatory. But I remain worried by the very real consequences of somehow promoting this fight against extremism in such narrow terms.\n\nVideo\n\nTrump was playing particularly to not just his Saudi hosts but the other Gulf Arab countries: Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. Shared interests with these Muslim countries include limiting Iran and its influence in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Also, a very shared interest in promoting lucrative oil and arms deals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut these countries don\u2019t represent Sunni Islam \u2014 or even the majority of the Muslim population. The majority live in Indonesia, South Asia, Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria. And it\u2019s important to note that Saudi Wahhabism, a deeply limiting, harsh and narrow vision of Islam, is rejected by the majority of Sunni orthodoxy, even though the Saudis\u2019 wealth has allowed them to export it through text books, mosques and preachers.\n\nMustafa: This whole meeting looked like a \u201cSunni international,\u201d in which the main non-Sunni power in Muslim world, Iran, was bashed by both the American President and his Sunni hosts. This is not going to help anything other than adding to the sectarian divide. It is not fair, either. Iran has lots of sins to account for \u2014 including its cynical support for the bloody regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. But most radical Islamist terrorists in the region are Sunni, not Shiite. In fact, in terms of their theology and jurisprudence, they are much closer to Saudi Arabia than Iran.\n\nWajahat: Trump just poured gallons of Saudi oil on the burning fires of sectarianism with this speech. So reckless! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think both sides, Saudi and Iran, are bad for using the Middle East as their sectarian playground. But we must be fair: Sunni extremism has far out exceeded the sins of Iran, which is guilty of abuses in Syria, Lebanon and support of Houthis. But what\u2019s happening in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis, a \u201csin,\u201d if I can use Trump\u2019s religious language, fueled by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat speech could have been written by a Saudi public relations firm! It inelegantly used religious language not to bridge the divides or unite Muslim communities through shared values and principles, but instead by political and economic interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, and the Trump administration.\n\nMustafa: All in all, this wasn\u2019t a speech about Islam. It was all about terrorism and the Middle East. Trump did not say anything significant about Islam as a religion and civilization. The whole point was that there are terrorists in the Middle East that we all should eradicate \u2014 and the United States selling \u201cbeautiful weapons,\u201d by the way, to help that effort.\n\nIn my view, the only audience this speech can help is Trump supporters back in America. They can realize that the Islam-is-the-enemy approach they expected to see from a \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d president is simply incorrect, and now even Trump sees this fact and acts accordingly.\n\nVideo\n\nWajahat: He tried to appease his base by calling for Saudi Arabia to \u201cDrive them out,\u201d but by dropping his big stick instead for a golden Saudi necklace. He wants to combat extremism by supporting authoritarian regimes that snuff out the very same Muslim men and women who are deprived of potential futures.", "publish_date": "2017-05-21", "authors": "Mustafa Akyol and Wajahat Ali", "type": "article"}
