By contrast, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the Federal District Court in Boston, issued a 21-page decision on Friday refusing to block the program and discussing the legal arguments in detail.\n\nJudge Gorton also sketched out the broader picture.\n\n\u201cThe rich immigrant history of the United States has long been a source of strength and pride in this country,\u201d Judge Gorton wrote. \u201cConversely, the public interest in safety and security in this ever-more dangerous world is strong as well.\u201d The balance, he wrote, tipped in favor of Mr. Trump.\n\nHow broad is the president\u2019s constitutional power?\n\nArticle II of the Constitution confers authority on the president, the Supreme Court has said, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration.\n\nIn their brief to Judge Robart, lawyers for Washington State, one of the two plaintiffs, along with the State of Minnesota, said there were constitutional checks on these powers. \u201cWhile courts generally give more latitude to the political branches in the immigration context, this does not mean that the political branches can act with impunity,\u201d the brief said.\n\n\u201cFederal courts,\u201d the brief said, \u201chave no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct.\u201d\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit, the Trump administration said judges were ill-equipped to decide cases involving national security. \u201cUnlike the president,\u201d the administration\u2019s brief said, \u201ccourts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process.\u201d\n\nNoah G. Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington State, appeared to concede in court that there were areas in which Mr. Trump was entitled to act. But he asked the court to protect people whose lives had been changed by Mr. Trump\u2019s order in a flash.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe focus of our claim,\u201d he said, \u201cis on people who have been here and have, overnight, lost the right to travel, lost the right to visit their families, lost the right to go perform research, lost the right to go speak at conferences around the world. And also people who had lived here for a long time and happened to be overseas at the time of this order, which came with no warning whatsoever, and suddenly lost the right to return to the United States.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sawyer, a 1952 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman\u2019s assertion that he had the authority to seize steel mills during the Korean War.\n\nThe most famous part of the decision is a concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, which set out a framework for considering clashes between presidential power and congressional authority. The president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent. The president\u2019s power is at its \u201clowest ebb,\u201d Justice Jackson wrote, when Congress has forbidden a particular action.\n\nTruman\u2019s actions fell into the third category, Justice Jackson wrote. Ms. Bennett, by contrast, said Mr. Trump\u2019s order was in the first category.\n\n\u201cHere we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he\u2019s acting at the apex of his power,\u201d she said.\n\nA key part of immigration law does give the president broad power. It says, \u201cWhenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut another part of the law forbids discrimination \u201cbecause of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,\u201d but only \u201cin the issuance of an immigrant visa.\u201d The Trump administration argues that the power to bar entry, the subject of the first law, is broader than the limits on issuing visas.\n\nWhat about arguments based on religious discrimination?\n\nLawyers for Washington State have said that the executive order violates the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition against government establishment of religion because its provisions on the refugee program favor minority religions. \u201cPresident Trump and his advisers have made clear that the very purpose of this order is to tilt the scales in favor of Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,\u201d they wrote in their brief to Judge Robart.\n\nThe Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the brief said, would violate the separation of powers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe more searching inquiry envisioned by the states would create substantial separation-of-powers problems, by permitting probing of the president\u2019s subjective motive in issuing the order,\u201d the brief said.\n\nCould the case founder on the issue of injury?\n\nThe states challenging the order face the initial hurdle of demonstrating that they have suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gives them standing to sue. Judge Robart ruled that they did, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which said Texas could sue to challenge President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to defer the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants and allow them to work.\n\n\u201cThe executive order adversely affects the states\u2019 residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,\u201d Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases.\n\nIn its Ninth Circuit brief, the Trump administration called the states\u2019 asserted injuries \u201cattenuated and speculative\u201d and did not address the Texas decision. In court in Seattle on Friday, Ms. Bennett said the government disagreed with the Texas ruling.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["wrote", "mr", "trump", "brief", "immigration", "judge", "court", "states", "order", "president", "power"], "summary": "Article II of the Constitution confers authority on the president, the Supreme Court has said, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration.\nHow much power has Congress given the president?\nThe president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent.\n\u201cHere we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he\u2019s acting at the apex of his power,\u201d she said.\nA key part of immigration law does give the president broad power."}
