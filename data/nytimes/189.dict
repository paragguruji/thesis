He recently called Andrew Jackson \u201can amazing figure in American history,\u201d as if he were describing the place of an apple fritter in the chronicle of baking.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Bannon must be familiar with the time Jackson declared martial law, jailed a judge and suspended habeas corpus while he was a military commander in New Orleans in 1814 and 1815, or when he illegally invaded Spanish Florida in 1818. His biggest swipe at the Constitution occurred during his presidency, in 1832, and again it grew out of his hatred of America\u2019s first inhabitants.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries goes against the bedrock constitutional idea that prohibits government from favoring one religion over another. His order is a Muslim ban, as Rudolph Giuliani helpfully explained, recalling a Trump conversation. Trump himself said that Christians would be given priority over other refugees.\n\nNow, let\u2019s assume the Supreme Court blocks this action, following judges from lower courts, citing both equal protection and the religious establishment clause of the document Trump has sworn to uphold.\n\nWhat follows could be a titanic test: Would Trump actually defy the Supreme Court? The way he has handled the fallout from the executive order shows that Trump, like any political bully, is willing to go as far as we\u2019ll let him.\n\nJackson set the pattern. In 1830, he pressed Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act, displacing thousands of people and ultimately leading to the Trail of Tears. About 4,000 Cherokee died in that long march, stumbling westward in rags after their homes were looted. Two years after the act, the Supreme Court laid a foundation for Indian sovereignty in a case out of Georgia, writing that the tribes were \u201cdistinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ruling infuriated Jackson. To him, Indians were \u201ca few savage hunters\u201d who should yield their land to white Christians. The Supreme Court decision, he wrote, was \u201cstillborn,\u201d because they \u201ccannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate.\u201d In other words: How many troops does the Supreme Court have? The court order was never enforced. And not long after Jackson\u2019s second term ended, most Indians had been removed from their ancient tribal homelands in the American South.\n\nThis history is haunting. Among the many things that keep people awake at night is a vision of a tyrannical Trump openly defying the Constitution. Because he has yet to fully untangle himself from his many personal holdings, he is already being sued for violation of the emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving money or gifts from foreign governments.\n\nBut that\u2019s a trifle compared to what an enraged Trump could do if the courts try to stop him on the Muslim ban. Don\u2019t count on Republicans, who waved their pocket copies of the Constitution at the most inconsequential executive orders of President Obama, to come to the rescue. Their patriotism is entirely situational.\n\nThe fate of the republic may hinge on how much Trump decides to emulate the slaveholding, Indian-hating, Constitution-violating man staring at him from that portrait in the Oval Office. Jackson is too close for comfort.", "publish_date": "2017-02-03", "authors": "Timothy Egan", "type": "article"}
