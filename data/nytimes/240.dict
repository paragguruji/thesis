But it said he was claiming something more \u2014 that \u201cnational security concerns are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithin minutes of the ruling, Mr. Trump angrily vowed to fight it, presumably in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nAt the White House, the president told reporters that the ruling was \u201ca political decision\u201d and predicted that his administration would win an appeal \u201cin my opinion, very easily.\u201d He said he had not yet conferred with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the matter.\n\nThe Supreme Court remains short-handed and could deadlock. A 4-to-4 tie there would leave the appeals court\u2019s ruling in place. The administration has moved fast in the case so far, and it is likely to file an emergency application to the Supreme Court in a day or two. The court typically asks for a prompt response from the other side, and it could rule soon after it received one. A decision next week, either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it, is possible.\n\nThe travel ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also barred visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes.\n\nImmediately after it was issued, the ban spurred chaos at airports and protests nationwide as foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints by a policy that critics derided as un-American. The State Department said up to 60,000 foreigners\u2019 visas were canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed.\n\nThe World Relief Corporation, one of the agencies that resettles refugees in the United States, called the ruling \u201cfabulous news\u201d for 275 newcomers who are scheduled to arrive in the next week, many of whom will be reunited with family.\n\n\u201cWe have families that have been separated for years by terror, war and persecution,\u201d said Scott Arbeiter, the president of the organization, which will arrange for housing and jobs for the refugees in cities including Seattle; Spokane, Wash.; and Sacramento.\n\n\u201cSome family members had already been vetted and cleared and were standing with tickets, and were then told they couldn\u2019t travel,\u201d Mr. Arbeiter said. \u201cSo the hope of reunification was crushed, and now they will be admitted.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nSeveral Democrats said they hoped the appeals court ruling would cow Mr. Trump into rescinding the ban. Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California, said in a statement that the ban \u201cis rooted in bigotry and, most importantly, it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will not stop,\u201d Ms. Bass said.\n\nBut some Republicans cast aspersions on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision and predicted that it would not withstand a challenge in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCourts ought not second-guess sensitive national security decisions of the president,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis misguided ruling is from the Ninth Circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America, and the most-reversed court at the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident the administration\u2019s position will ultimately prevail.\u201d\n\nTrial judges nationwide have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, but no other case has yet reached an appeals court. The case in front of Judge Robart, in Seattle, was filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota and is still at an early stage. The appeals court order issued Thursday ruled only on the narrow question of whether to stay a lower court\u2019s temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban.", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": "Adam Liptak", "type": "article"}
