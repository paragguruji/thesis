She declined to say how deep those cuts would turn out to be, saying she was in discussions with members of Congress who ultimately control the purse strings.\n\n\u201cThis is a time, in short, to show the people reasons to support the U.N.,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking to the council, Ms. Haley took a very different tone than she had with a different audience earlier in the week. On Monday night, at a policy conference held by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group, Ms. Haley spoke of the utility of high-heeled shoes in diplomacy: \u201cIf I see something wrong, we\u2019re going to kick them.\u201d The remark was met with huge applause.\n\nIn her remarks on Wednesday, Ms. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, relied on familiar colloquial expressions and offered few specifics about the many foreign policy challenges facing the administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to call out the governments that don\u2019t have our backs,\u201d she said in her opening remarks, without naming names.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this administration is, all bets are off,\u201d she said in response to a question. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to look at how things were done in the past.\u201d\n\nMs. Haley mentioned, as she has before, that the administration would closely scrutinize United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and said that the United States should bear no more than 25 percent of the total costs, a reduction from the current 28 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(The council also discusses Yemen every month and Syria three times a month.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Haley demurred when asked about proposals to expand the Security Council and about how to achieve peace in Syria, except to say that the country\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, was \u201ca big hindrance.\u201d\n\nShe was not asked about two important challenges for the United Nations system, climate change and famine.\n\nShe used her address to deliver a pointed attack on the United Nations Human Rights Council, the main international body meant to promote and defend human rights.\n\n\u201cI mean, the Human Rights Council is so corrupt,\u201d she said, adding that it includes \u201cbad actors\u201d who use it to protect themselves.\n\nSeveral countries with poor human rights records, including China and Saudi Arabia, have indeed won seats on the council. But the United States has itself used its seat to forcefully defend its allies, including Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of abuses in the war in Yemen.\n\nMs. Haley said she would attend the Human Rights Council\u2019s June session, but declined to say whether she favored withdrawing from the body. The United States withdrew from its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights.\n\nMs. Haley argued that the Security Council \u2014 where the United States has a veto \u2014 should be the United Nations body addressing human rights issues. She said she would organize a session on the topic in April when the United States takes its turn in the council\u2019s rotating presidency.\n\nThe Security Council has taken up human rights in the past, and sought to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, but Russia and China blocked the move with their vetoes.\n\nPerhaps the most uncomfortable moment of Ms. Haley\u2019s speech on Wednesday came when she tried to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. She insisted that it was not meant to exclude Muslims, but to strengthen vetting procedures for asylum seekers. At one point, she cited this month\u2019s London terrorist attack as a justification for the travel ban. The audience murmured audibly; the London assailant was a native-born Briton.", "publish_date": "2017-03-29", "authors": "Somini Sengupta", "type": "article"}
