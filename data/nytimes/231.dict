After the president temporarily barred people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer\u2019s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump\u2019s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January.\n\n\u201cOver the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn\u2019t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,\u201d the Nordstrom statement said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate.\n\n\u201cIt is a total misuse of presidential power,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. \u201cHe is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line \u2014 they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her \u201cmultiyear term\u201d as \u201cone of the most photographed women in the world\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to her status as a candidate\u2019s wife and now first lady \u2014 as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year.\n\nRobert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump\u2019s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family\u2019s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,\u201d Mr. Weissman said. \u201cThat is obviously not the case.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom\u2019s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line.\n\nThe Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump\u2019s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores.\n\nLast week, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees \u2014 a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times \u2014 telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But an employee at one of the company\u2019s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there.\n\nNeiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump\u2019s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy\u2019s, the nation\u2019s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale\u2019s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale\u2019s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka\u2019s sales numbers and weighing whether they\u2019re worth all the problems she\u2019s brought them,\u201d said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products.", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": "Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Rachel Abrams", "type": "article"}
