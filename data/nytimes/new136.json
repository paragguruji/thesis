The move stunned the global community, drawing criticism from business leaders, European heads of state and Christian leaders, though many Trump fans were unfazed.\n\nBesides the A.C.L.U., other groups have seen a rise in donations. The National Immigration Law Center, which joined the A.C.L.U. in a suit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees detained on Saturday, has raised $269,000 since the Trump order was signed, its executive director, Marielena Hincapie, said.\n\nMs. Hincapie said donations had increased \u201cacross the board\u201d and were now larger, more frequent and coming from more individual donors than her group had ever seen. A surge of individual donations after the election in November also boosted the law center\u2019s annual budget to $7.5 million from $5.5 million, she added.\n\nFund-raising for her organization was usually \u201cslow and tedious work,\u201d but not anymore, she said.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s election completely changed that and set us on a new path and has allowed us to be a stronger and more nimble organization,\u201d Ms. Hincapie said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHumanitarian groups have seen a boost in donations, as well. Kal Penn, an actor and a former official in the White House Office of Public Engagement under President Barack Obama, started an online fund-raising appeal for the International Rescue Committee, which works in conflict and disaster zones around the world.\n\nMr. Penn said the fund-raising had been inspired by an internet \u201ctroll\u201d who told him he didn\u2019t belong in the United States.\n\n\u201cTo the dude who said I don\u2019t belong in America, I started a fund-raising page for Syrian refugees in your name,\u201d Mr. Penn wrote on Twitter. That tweet was shared more than 35,000 times, and by Sunday, the site had raised over $390,000.\n\nThe I.R.C. began its own fund-raising effort on Sunday with the goal of bringing in $5 million to help the organization respond to the needs of refugees in the United States. The group said it was the first time it had launched an appeal for people in the United States.\n\nThe fund-raising efforts were promoted by at least one actress during the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night, Sarah Paulson, who urged people to donate to the A.C.L.U. \u201cto protect the rights and liberties of people across this country.\u201d\n\nMany of the winners, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus of TV\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d and Mahershala Ali of the film \u201cMoonlight,\u201d used their acceptance speeches to denounce the policies of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe A.C.L.U. sees itself as a leader in the opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. It lead the charge on Saturday with the lawsuit in New York that resulted in an emergency ruling by a federal judge blocking the deportation of detainees who had already landed here.\n\nThe court order was the second legal action filed by the group against the Trump administration, which is little more than one week old.\n\nEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, the A.C.L.U. had received more than $47 million from 400,000 donors, Mr. Romero said. The organization used the money \u2014 the largest surge in donations in its 97 year history, he said \u2014 to hire 200 staff members, primarily lawyers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat is the Trump Effect,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cThose 400,000 people, who donated to us, I did not go after them; they came to us. In fact, our website crashed we had so many donations, we could not handle it.\u201d", "authors": ["Liam Stack"], "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["organizations", "trump", "fundraising", "refugees", "united", "trumps", "organization", "aclu", "donations", "million", "order", "mr", "surge"], "summary": "Critics noted that the order for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d was in effect a ban on Muslims, and did not target countries in which Mr. Trump has had business interests.\nin a suit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees detained on Saturday, has raised $269,000 since the Trump order was signed, its executive director, Marielena Hincapie, said.\nA surge of individual donations after the election in November also boosted the law center\u2019s annual budget to $7.5 million from $5.5 million, she added.\nEven before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, the A.C.L.U.\nThe organization used the money \u2014 the largest surge in donations in its 97 year history, he said \u2014 to hire 200 staff members, primarily lawyers."}
