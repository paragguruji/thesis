Her son is a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division, which is based at Fort Bragg.\n\nWhen she did not show up at the airport, Sgt. Alsaeedy\u2019s immediate fear was that his mother, who does not speak English, had somehow gotten lost.\n\nHe flew to New York, where another reality awaited him. His mother was not lost: She was being held somewhere in Terminal 4 by authorities who were threatening to deport her. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even let me see her,\u201d Sgt. Alsaeedy, a newly minted American citizen, said by phone on Sunday morning from the airport, where he was still waiting for his mother.\n\nA native of Baghdad, Sgt. Alsaeedy has been working for the American government for much of his life. After the 2003 invasion, he was an interpreter for seven years, working for the American military and the United States Agency for International Development. For his service, he eventually received a special immigrant visa and emigrated to the United States.\n\nHe joined the Army and returned to Iraq in 2015, this time as a United States soldier with the 82nd Airborne Division. \u201cI cannot tell you what I was doing,\u201d he said when asked about his role. All he would say was this: \u201cThe mission we were doing there, I was a part of it.\u201d\n\nFor years, he had been filling out endless forms so that his mother and his father could join him in America. \u201cI started the process five years ago to bring both parents to this country,\u201d Sgt. Alsaeedy said.\n\nIn December, his father died. A few weeks later, his mother\u2019s visa was approved. He immediately booked a flight for her. At the moment that the president signed the immigration order, at 4:42 p.m. in Washington on Friday, she was probably waiting to board her flight in Doha.\n\nWhen Sgt. Alsaeedy arrived at J.F.K. searching for his mother on Saturday, other families were waiting at the airport with similar stories. With the help of lawyers, he filed a habeas petition for her release. And his morale was buoyed by the swelling protests outside.\n\n\u201cThis country is great because of those people, the thousands outside who were protesting and helping people with whom they have no relation,\u201d Sgt. Alsaeedy said. \u201cEven in my worst situation, I felt hope and freedom and that there are great people.\u201d\n\nBut even as the protests were occurring, Sgt. Alsaeedy received a phone call with crushing news. A federal agent told him that his mother would be deported on a flight bound for Germany around 9 p.m. The agent offered to put Sgt. Alsaeedy\u2019s mother on the phone to say goodbye. She was crying.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to see you and hug your child,\u201d she said, according to Sgt. Alsaeedy, who said he was stunned, unsure what to say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d he said, hoping to calm her down.\n\nIn the end, his mother was not deported. She was held for more than 33 hours, handcuffed for some of the time, and was denied a wheelchair, according to a lawyer for Sgt. Alsaeedy, Molly Lauterback of Brooklyn Defender Services. They were reunited at J.F.K. after 4 p.m. on Sunday.\n\n\u2014 Joseph Goldstein", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["lives", "mother", "stroke", "airport", "phone", "pen", "sgt", "united", "flight", "waiting", "son", "alsaeedy", "american", "rewritten"], "summary": "It was not by chance that her new life as an American immigrant would begin in North Carolina.\nWhen she did not show up at the airport, Sgt.\nHis mother was not lost: She was being held somewhere in Terminal 4 by authorities who were threatening to deport her.\nAlsaeedy, a newly minted American citizen, said by phone on Sunday morning from the airport, where he was still waiting for his mother.\nA federal agent told him that his mother would be deported on a flight bound for Germany around 9 p.m."}
