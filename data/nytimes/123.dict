On Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying that travelers being held at airports across the United States should not be sent back to their home countries. Federal judges in three states \u2014 Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington \u2014 soon issued similar rulings.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would comply with the rulings while it continued to enforce the president\u2019s executive orders. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on Sunday that green-card holders from the seven targeted countries would not be prevented from returning to the United States.\n\nDemonstrations against the ban continued on Sunday and Monday, and at least 100 diplomats at the State Department signed a dissent memo expressing opposition.\n\nOpponents of the ban got a boost on Monday from Mr. Obama, who criticized the executive order and endorsed the protests against it, and Ms. Yates, who ordered the Justice Department not to defend the executive order in court. She said she did not believe the order to be lawful.\n\nMr. Trump fired Ms. Yates just hours after she defied him, saying she had \u201cbetrayed\u201d his administration and was \u201cweak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump replaced Ms. Yates with Dana J. Boente, United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He will now serve as acting attorney general.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s inner circle had left much of the administration in the dark about the executive order. It was created with little to no legal review or input from the departments most involved in carrying it out, in particular Homeland Security. It was written by a small White House team overseen by Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist and former Breitbart News executive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe order was widely condemned by Democrats, religious groups, business leaders, immigration policy experts, academics and others, but was praised by some Republican leaders, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimated that 20,000 refugees from all over the world would be affected immediately by the ban. The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that the ban violated international human rights law.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on his nomination on Tuesday.\n\nIt was unclear how consistently airport officials across the country were complying with the court rulings that partly blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. Mr. Priebus\u2019s statements on Sunday morning did little to clarify how the executive order would be interpreted and carried out in the weeks ahead.\n\nHe said border agents had \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to subject travelers, including American citizens, to additional scrutiny if they had been to any of the seven countries mentioned in the executive order, but it was not clear what that would look like in practice.", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Liam Stack", "type": "article"}
