In that interview, he seemed to defend Mr. Putin\u2019s brutality while saying that American political leaders have \u201ckilled\u201d people too.\n\nThe president appears to think that the avalanche of criticism he received is unfair, even though his insistence that he doesn\u2019t know Mr. Putin or have deals in Russia is unrelated to his praise of the Russian president.\n\nWhat\u2019s next on Trump\u2019s immigration order?\n\nThe website of the federal appeals court in San Francisco is about to be tested.\n\nThe court will hear arguments at 3 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday on the Trump administration\u2019s emergency request to reinstate Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order suspending travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and limiting the nation\u2019s refugee program.\n\nThe argument in the fast-moving case will be heard by telephone, and the court at first said it would release a recording afterward. An hour and a half later, the court thought better of the delay, now saying the hearing would be live-streamed on its site.\n\nYou can listen to a live stream of the arguments here:\n\nThe president had some thoughts to share on the subject.\n\nPaul D. Ryan as Trump translator\n\nFor a moment, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan seemed to be in the clear.\n\nAmid the now-typical deluge of questions for Mr. Ryan about the latest explosive comment from Mr. Trump, a reporter acknowledged the speaker\u2019s standard reply: that he does not tend to comment on the \u201ctweet of the day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou got my talking points down already!\u201d Mr. Ryan said, perking up.\n\nHe did elaborate, though, steering clear of any remark that could be construed as a knock on the president.\n\nOn the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that the news media had willfully ignored or played down international terrorist attacks: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to whether or not you\u2019re over or underreporting something. That\u2019s your job. I\u2019ll stick with doing mine.\u201d\n\nOn Mr. Trump attacking who he called the \u201cso-called judge\u201d responsible for blocking the president\u2019s immigration order: \u201cLook, he\u2019s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court.\u201d\n\nOn the uncertainty wrought by the president\u2019s recent suggestion that the Affordable Care Act might not be replaced until next year: \u201cI think there\u2019s a little confusion here.\u201d\n\nThe legislative process will have played out this year, Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe question is, how long does it take to implement the full replacement of Obamacare?\u201d\n\nMelania Trump settles libel lawsuit\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump has settled a libel lawsuit against a Maryland blogger over a blog post published in August that she said contained \u201cfalse and defamatory statements,\u201d including that she once worked as a high-end escort.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in September in Montgomery County, Md., pertained to a post that Webster G. Tarpley had published on his blog, Tarpley.net, in early August.\n\nMr. Tarpley retracted the post on Aug. 22 and issued an apology to Mrs. Trump. In a statement, Mr. Tarpley again issued a retraction and apologized to Mrs. Trump for publishing a post that was \u201creplete with false and defamatory statements about her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI acknowledge that these false statements were very harmful and hurtful to Mrs. Trump and her family, and therefore I sincerely apologize to Mrs. Trump, her son, her husband and her parents for making these false statements,\u201d he said.\n\nCharles J. Harder, a lawyer for Mrs. Trump, said in statement on his client\u2019s behalf that Mr. Tarpley had agreed to pay Mrs. Trump \u201ca substantial sum as a settlement.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Mr. Tarpley, Mrs. Trump sued the publisher of The Daily Mail for libel. (The Daily Mail also published a retraction and apology.) A Maryland judge dismissed the lawsuit against The Daily Mail publisher last week after determining that Maryland courts do not have jurisdiction over Mrs. Trump\u2019s claims; the lawsuit was refiled on Monday in New York State Court.\n\nBernie Sanders and Ted Cruz will debate\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas will square off in a debate that liberal and conservative purists probably would have preferred in 2016 \u2014 a bronze medal game, of sorts, for the presidency.\n\nThe CNN town hall-style meeting will focus largely on the Affordable Care Act in the age of Trump. We\u2019ll bring real-time analysis \u2014 policy, yuks, everything in between \u2014 from the reporters who covered the pair during their presidential runs and from a health policy expert.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
