A caustic presence in a chaotic West Wing, Mr. Bannon frequently clashed with other aides as they fought over trade, the war in Afghanistan, taxes, immigration and the role of government.\n\nIn an interview this week with The American Prospect, Mr. Bannon mocked his colleagues, including Gary D. Cohn, one of the president\u2019s chief economic advisers, saying they were \u201cwetting themselves\u201d out of a fear of radically changing trade policy.\n\nMr. Trump had recently grown weary of Mr. Bannon, complaining to other advisers that he believed his chief strategist had been leaking information to reporters and was taking too much credit for the president\u2019s successes. The situation had become untenable long before Friday, according to advisers close to Mr. Trump who had been urging the president to remove Mr. Bannon; in turn, people close to Mr. Bannon also were urging him to step down.\n\nBy Friday night, Mr. Bannon was already back at the far-right Breitbart News, chairing an editorial meeting at the organization he helped run before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and where he can continue to advance his agenda.\n\nMr. Bannon can still wield influence from outside the West Wing. He believes he can use his perch at Breitbart \u2014 which has given a platform to the so-called alt-right, a loose collection of activists, some of whom espouse openly racist and anti-Semitic views \u2014 to publicly pressure the president.\n\nAnd he may still play an insider\u2019s role as a confidant for the president, offering advice and counsel, much like other former advisers who still frequently consult with Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon had formed a philosophical alliance with Mr. Trump, and they shared an unlikely chemistry.\n\nMr. Bannon has indicated to people that he does not intend to harm Mr. Trump and he has promised to be somewhat reserved about other administration officials, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn many ways I think I can be more effective fighting from the outside for the agenda President Trump ran on. And anyone who stands in our way, we will go to war with,\u201d Mr. Bannon said on Friday.\n\nBut his former colleagues in the West Wing are uncertain how long that will last.\n\nJoel Pollak, a Breitbart executive, tweeted after Mr. Bannon\u2019s departure was made public a single word with a hashtag: \u201c#WAR.\u201d Mr. Bannon called reporters to suggest Mr. Pollak had gone too far, but he also acknowledged his own disappointment at departing the White House.\n\nHe told The Weekly Standard: \u201cThe Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over. We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It\u2019ll be something else. And there\u2019ll be all kinds of fights, and there\u2019ll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon later clarified to The New York Times that he did not mean the Trump agenda was over; instead, he said he was referring to his direct work with Mr. Trump, from the end of the campaign to the first stages of his presidency.\n\nStill, allies of the president predicted that Mr. Bannon\u2019s ouster would help Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be good for both Steve and for the president,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media who has known the president for years.\n\n\u201cThe president has a major hurdle in the fall, I think, in getting legislation passed,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said. He cited several lawmakers who had told the White House \u201cthat they had a real problem with Steve because of Breitbart, and Breitbart\u2019s been a thorn in the side for a lot of congressional Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe president has struggled to overcome the dysfunction that has plagued his administration. Bitter feuds among aides were frequently showcased on cable news and in the pages of newspapers. Mr. Bannon was among those suspected of repeatedly leaking the details of internal White House debates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to nominate this White House for a Tony Award for the most drama, not the best drama but the most drama,\u201d said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track, eight months in, how many people have been fired? How many have left?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first year has been plagued by departures, including Anthony Scaramucci and Michael Dubke, both of whom served as communications director; Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser; Sean Spicer, the press secretary; and Reince Priebus, who was chief of staff before Mr. Kelly.\n\nThe sense of chaos continued on Friday as Carl Icahn, a billionaire investor who was advising Mr. Trump on regulatory issues, announced he was stepping down from that role. And A.R. Bernard, a pastor on the president\u2019s Evangelical Advisory Board, quit, citing a \u201cdeepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.\u201d\n\nBy dismissing Mr. Bannon, the president loses the most visible avatar of the nationalist agenda that propelled him to victory. Contentious and difficult, Mr. Bannon was nonetheless a driving force behind the president\u2019s most high-profile policies: imposing a ban on travelers from several majority-Muslim countries; shrinking the federal bureaucracy; shedding regulations; and rethinking trade policies by aggressively confronting China and other countries.\n\nHe was also an opponent of Mr. Cohn, a former official at Goldman Sachs, and Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser who had also worked on Wall Street. Mr. Cohn is a registered Democrat, and both he and Ms. Powell have been denounced by conservative media outlets as being antithetical to Mr. Trump\u2019s populist message.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

On one hand, Mr. Bannon told friends that Mr. Trump was a populist savant who had a deeper connection with the alienated white working class than any politician in the last half-century. But Mr. Bannon, a former naval officer, also saw the president as increasingly trapped by the generals he surrounded himself with, and moving toward an interventionist foreign policy.\n\nMr. Bannon complained bitterly about the president\u2019s provocative and unscripted threats to North Korea and was especially concerned about a wider attempt to reassert American military power in the Western Hemisphere. He told his small circle of like-minded confidants in the West Wing that he feared the president would be talked into an intervention in Venezuela, where President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been cracking down on the opposition amid a deteriorating economic and political situation.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump suggested that a military option was under consideration in Venezuela. Mr. Bannon told people close to him that the statement indicated the president is relying too heavily on advisers who want him to embark on \u201cmilitary adventures.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bannon frequently clashed with Mr. Kushner and others in the administration who sought a more traditional, globalist approach to the world\u2019s problems. He also had a long-running feud with Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser.\n\nThere were different interpretations of how Mr. Bannon left his job, which had been long anticipated in Washington.\n\nOne White House official, who would not be named discussing the president\u2019s thinking, said Mr. Trump has wanted to remove Mr. Bannon since he ousted Mr. Priebus three weeks ago. Since then, Mr. Kelly has been evaluating Mr. Bannon\u2019s status, according to the official.\n\nBut a person close to Mr. Bannon insisted that the parting of ways was his idea, and that he had submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, to be announced at the start of this week, timed to his one-year anniversary of working for Mr. Trump.\n\nAccording to three people close to the discussions, Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon agreed during the previous week that he would depart. But the violence in Charlottesville pushed Mr. Bannon closer to Mr. Trump; he encouraged the president to stand by his impulses in his response and, one of the three people said, sought to stay on longer.\n\nThat became untenable after the American Prospect interview, in which he mocked colleagues, though he later said he thought was off the record. In it, Mr. Bannon also contradicted Mr. Trump\u2019s tough threats toward North Korea, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no military solution here, they got us.\u201d Privately, several White House officials said that Mr. Bannon appeared to be provoking Mr. Trump.", "publish_date": "2017-08-18", "authors": "Maggie Haberman, Michael D.
