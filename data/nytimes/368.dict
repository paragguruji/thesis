Kennedy. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting these battles for years.\u201d\n\nComposure is central to the Casey political brand. There is a family joke about a stubborn mood ring given to Mr. Casey in the 1970s: It never changed colors.\n\nStill, admirers say they can identify Mr. Casey\u2019s recent spark.\n\n\u201cTrump has gotten his Irish up,\u201d said Paul Begala, the Democratic strategist who first encountered Mr. Casey when his father, Robert P. Casey, ran successfully for Pennsylvania governor in 1986.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The senator has described his own skill set as \u201cblue-collar banger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Mr. Casey, the Capitol\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion Democrat, the more visible Trump-era profile also coincides with a national reckoning over whether opponents of abortion rights should have a place in the party\u2019s future. Last month, Thomas E. Perez, the party\u2019s newly elected chairman, said it was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d for Democrats to \u201csupport a woman\u2019s right to make her own choices about her body and her health.\u201d\n\nOther party leaders have countered that such a litmus test could doom Democrats to perpetual minority status. In private, many elected officials have invoked Mr. Casey as an example of the kind of figure the party would do well not to alienate.\n\nThe Casey family\u2019s opposition to abortion is enshrined in a Supreme Court decision: Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which, in 1992, reaffirmed Roe v. Wade but upheld part of a Pennsylvania law regulating access to abortions during the elder Mr. Casey\u2019s tenure. The former governor died in 2000.\n\nDuring his time in the Senate, though, the younger Mr. Casey has become an ally of sorts for Planned Parenthood, fighting Republican efforts to defund the organization.\n\n\u201cI think our party is a much bigger tent than it was 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Mr. Casey said in his office, where a Pope Francis doll is perched beside his desk. He suggested that work on economic priorities for Democrats could transcend social issues.\n\nAs he seeks re-election next year, Mr. Casey has charted a different course from that of some fellow Democrats in states that Mr. Trump won, several of whom have trod more carefully. Generally, such Democrats, like Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, represent far more right-leaning states.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Mr. Casey was an early and forceful opponent of the nomination of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, joining the Democratic filibuster without hesitation.\n\nPennsylvania Republicans say his choices will not go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cEven before the Trump presidency, he\u2019s been moving consistently to the left, abandoning any pretense of being the man his father was, somebody who could reach across the aisle,\u201d said Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the state\u2019s Republican Party, who predicted that Trump-voting Democrats in Western Pennsylvania would abandon Mr. Casey, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Casey\u2019s possible challengers include Representative Lou Barletta, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest campaign supporters in Congress.\n\nEdward G. Rendell, the former governor who won the job after defeating Mr. Casey in a 2002 primary, said Mr. Casey\u2019s heightened outspokenness was not politically foolproof.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou can say that Bob Casey is doing this at some political risk to himself,\u201d Mr. Rendell said, adding that he believed Mr. Casey\u2019s \u201cevolution\u201d in tone reflected a genuine anger at the Trump administration. \u201cHe always was a Democrat who ran well with moderates and even some reasonable conservatives. Is he throwing that away by being so vocal and emphatic on these issues? Well, maybe so.\u201d\n\nMr. Casey\u2019s office noted that of the 31 Pennsylvania counties he had visited since the election, 21 voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd his words have carried outsize weight in Democratic caucus meetings, where the party continues to grapple with how to recover its standing with working-class white voters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said of Mr. Casey, sounding like a teacher at a parents\u2019 conference. \u201cThat quiet tone shouldn\u2019t fool anybody.\u201d\n\nIn all likelihood, though, Mr. Casey\u2019s seat became safer with November\u2019s result, allowing him to position himself against a sitting president rather than defend a third consecutive Democratic term in the White House.\n\nMr. Rendell predicted that Mr. Casey and Gov. Tom Wolf were the \u201conly two Pennsylvania Democrats who will benefit from Donald Trump winning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral colleagues and supporters rejected any suggestion that Mr. Casey had changed much in substance with the arrival of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Bob Casey I\u2019ve known for 10 years,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t changed him. Trump has forced all of us to be more outspoken.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, Mr. Casey, who became an ally of President Barack Obama after endorsing him over Hillary Clinton in 2008, seems to have established himself as a broadly reliable Democrat \u2014 one whom the party\u2019s leading voices appear eager to embrace in public.\n\nIt was not always that way.\n\nWhen Mr. Casey was weighing a Senate run before the 2006 elections, Mr. Rendell remembered, he received calls from Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton, who was then a senator from New York. They asked if Mr. Rendell, then the governor, could help clear the primary field for Mr. Casey, he said. He obliged.\n\nThen came the deluge of protests from abortion rights activists. Mr. Rendell called the senators back, asking if he could ease the pressure by spreading word that Mr. Casey had their support.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ll get back to you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rendell said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s now 10 years later. They\u2019ve never gotten back to me.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-05-19", "authors": "Matt Flegenheimer", "type": "article"}
