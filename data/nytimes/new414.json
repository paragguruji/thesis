Reality-\u00adbending litigators who favor bold claims over careful persuasion, Trump Lawyers enabled \u2014 and in many ways, defined \u2014 Trump\u2019s surreal New York rise. Now, operating in a new and hostile environment, it\u2019s up to them to prevent his fall.\n\nTrump\u2019s entire career has effectively been one long legal entanglement. He filed his first major lawsuit more than 40 years ago, and it was, in fact, a countersuit. The government sued him for housing discrimination; he sued the government back for $100 million, charging defamation. (The countersuit, which Trump announced at a news conference, was dismissed, and Trump eventually signed a consent decree in which he agreed to take various steps to desegregate his properties.) Thousands of legal actions followed. Before the election, USA Today tallied up all the lawsuits that Trump and his companies were involved in over just the last 30 years. The final count was 4,095. \u2018\u2018Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?\u2019\u2019 Trump said of himself at a campaign rally in January 2016. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m like a Ph.D. in litigation.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s the lawyers who get the work done, and Trump has an eye for a particular kind of talent. Goldberg led me to his dining-\u00adroom table and told me about his first encounter with Trump. It happened on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1990. As Goldberg tells the story, he was in Greenwich Village shopping for a negligee for his wife when his pager went off. He found a pay phone and called his secretary: Donald Trump wanted to see him as soon as possible. They met that very afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the time, Trump was wading into what was, at least until recently, the biggest legal battle of his life: his divorce from his first wife, Ivana. \u2018\u2018Lawyers were making journeys to Mr. Trump\u2019s office to represent him for nothing, just for the publicity,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg told me. He said he tried to talk Trump out of giving him the job: \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t know the first thing about matrimonial law.\u2019\u2019 But Trump, who had noticed a short profile of Goldberg as part of a feature in 7 Days magazine titled \u2018\u2018Courtroom Killers,\u2019\u2019 wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. He had found his guy.\n\nGoldberg was a tabloid celebrity in his own right, one who had defended high-\u00adprofile figures like Matthew (Matty the Horse) Ianniello, who ran what prosecutors called a \u2018\u2018smut cartel\u2019\u2019 of topless bars and pornography shops in Manhattan; the gangster Meyer Lansky, who inspired, among other cinematic figures, the character of Hyman Roth in \u2018\u2018The Godfather, Part II\u2019\u2019; and Bess Myerson, the former Miss America and New York City commissioner accused of conspiring to bribe a judge to reduce her boyfriend\u2019s alimony payments. (She was later acquitted.) Goldberg leapt right into the Trump divorce, posing on the courthouse steps in Downtown Manhattan with a giant placard of a check signed by Donald to Ivana for $10 million: the amount Trump had offered her to settle the case. (The final number was $14 million.) At another point in the proceedings, the New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams reported that Goldberg had described himself as a \u2018\u2018killer\u2019\u2019 who could \u2018\u2018rip skin off a body.\u2019\u2019 Numerous cases followed, including Trump\u2019s next divorce, from Marla Maples, and a nasty battle with the Las Vegas casino tycoon Steve Wynn (now a Trump friend and supporter).\n\nGoldberg interrupted our conversation to take a call, leaving me to thumb through a 1985 copy of House & Garden magazine that had been set out for me. It included a feature on a sumptuous Bridgehampton home he now owns, where an enormous interior brick chimney had been painted gold and where, Goldberg said, Trump had been a guest.\n\nWhen he returned, Goldberg told me that nothing compared to the rush of a criminal-\u00addefense trial. There, before a rapt audience in a sanctum of justice, this Harvard-\u00adtrained lawyer from Brooklyn who spent his summers on the borscht belt could be at his most performative. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s theater in the courtroom,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the only place where you get to emote and try to convince juries that black is white.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor all the uncertainty about what a Trump presidency would bring, one thing should have been clear from the start: It was going to involve a lot of lawyers.\n\nIn the most formal sense, Trump\u2019s top lawyer is Donald McGahn, who parlayed his job as general counsel to the Trump campaign into the position of White House counsel. McGahn is the nephew of another Trump Lawyer, Patrick McGahn, known as Paddy. The well-\u00adconnected son of an Atlantic City saloonkeeper, Paddy controlled access to the city\u2019s casinos and worked as a fixer for Trump for many years. So grateful was Trump to Paddy \u2014 until Trump sued him for overbilling, that is \u2014 that he named a bar in the Trump Taj Mahal casino Paddy\u2019s Saloon.\n\nDonald McGahn\u2019s client isn\u2019t exactly the president, though; it\u2019s the institution of the presidency. Trump\u2019s conversations with McGahn about his personal legal affairs are not protected by attorney-\u00adclient privilege. For that, Trump would need outside counsel.\n\nEven before Trump took office, he asked Sheri Dillon, a partner at Morgan Lewis who handled his taxes, to deal with his financial disclosures. And as the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election began to heat up, Trump called in further reinforcements, lawyers whose loyalty to him would not be divided. In May, he countered the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as special investigator with the hiring of Marc Kasowitz, whose firm has handled everything from casino bankruptcies to libel suits for Trump. Kasowitz brought along one of his law-\u00adfirm partners, Michael Bowe, who made his name as a Wall Street litigator.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sekulow is a well-known advocate for Christian causes who hosts a syndicated daily radio show and appears frequently on Fox News. (Sekulow\u2019s own virtuousness has been called into question by a recent report in The Guardian that accused his Christian charity of paying $60 million to him and his family members since 2000; Sekulow\u2019s spokesman said the charity has passed all I.R.S. audits.) To appease advisers who said he needed an experienced Washington defense lawyer, Trump added John Dowd, who oversaw Major League Baseball\u2019s investigation into Pete Rose\u2019s gambling. A former Marine Corps captain, Dowd had not softened with age. \u2018\u2018This is the worst piece of whoring journalism I have read in a long time,\u2019\u2019 he once wrote to a Wall Street Journal reporter who was covering the insider-\u00adtrading case of one of his clients. And if he was going to be in a fight, Trump knew he needed his longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen, who has described Trump as his \u2018\u2018patriarch.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey came from different places, but they were all Trump Lawyers, which is to say that they shared certain characteristics. Trump Lawyers seldom shape or massage their client\u2019s rhetoric in the fashion of, say, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s counselor, Ted Sorensen, who drafted the letter from Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev that helped end the Cuban Missile Crisis. They bear no resemblance to David Kendall, the reserved Washington superlawyer who led the defense of President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Trump Lawyers do not devote countless hours to construing the fine print of the law in a very particular way to prevent prosecution, as John Yoo, a lawyer in President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, did when he drafted the legal guidelines for the administration\u2019s interrogation techniques.\n\nIndeed, Trump Lawyers don\u2019t anticipate problems or take precautions at all. Trump Lawyers fight \u2014 occasionally in courtrooms, but mostly on TV. It didn\u2019t matter that Kasowitz isn\u2019t known for criminal defense \u2014 until recently, his claim to legal fame was that he negotiated the settlement that saved the maker of Chesterfield cigarettes from financial ruin \u2014 any more than it mattered that Goldberg had never handled a divorce. Like Trump, Trump Lawyers tend to have something of an attention-\u00adgrabbing rebellious streak: Sekulow, who grew up Jewish in Brooklyn, now identifies as a messianic Jew; he believes that Jesus is the messiah. Until recently, McGahn played guitar in a classic-\u00adrock cover band. At the same time, Trump Lawyers embody the clich\u00e9 of a certain type of litigator in much the same way that Trump\u2019s properties embody the clich\u00e9 of luxury. They are rainmakers; they are flamboyant; they are bare-\u00adknuckled; they are hard-\u00adcharging.\n\nTrump Lawyers practice Trump Law. Trump Law is not about the merits of a case or even its resolution. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re threatening to sue, suing or being sued yourself. What matters is that you dominate, or be seen as dominating. In Trump Law, you can lose and still win, or at least declare victory, as Trump did after losing his defamation suit against the author Timothy O\u2019Brien, claiming, falsely, that he had succeeded in his goal of costing O\u2019Brien a lot of money. \u2018\u2018Trump and Kasowitz saw our litigation as a form of guerrilla warfare, I think, and were less concerned about facts and the law,\u2019\u2019 says O\u2019Brien, whose publisher covered all of his legal expenses. After the suit was filed, O\u2019Brien realized that he had met Kasowitz before: The lawyer had been in the audience at one of his readings and told O\u2019Brien afterward \u2014 elliptically at the time, ominously in retrospect \u2014 that they would be seeing each other again.\n\nTrump Law is theater. What matters most is showmanship. The proof that the president-\u00adelect was relinquishing control of his companies before taking the oath of office was right there in the stacks of manila folders piled up beside him at the pre-\u00adinauguration news conference inside Trump Tower. Don Jr. and Eric Trump, who would be taking over the Trump Organization, watched solemnly as Sheri Dillon gestured at the files, explaining that they contained just some of the paperwork that would ensure that President Trump would be completely isolated from the businesses. Were the pages inside actually blank? In the world of Trump Law, that\u2019s irrelevant.\n\n\u2018\u2018One of the things you discover about being president,\u2019\u2019 President Barack Obama said during a lengthy news conference several days after the 2016 election, \u2018\u2018is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you\u2019ve got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms, and that\u2019s a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming president.\u2019\u2019 In terms of ethics, he said: \u2018\u2018I will put this administration against any administration in history. And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. We had a strong White House Counsel\u2019s Office. We had a strong ethics office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people: This is how you\u2019re supposed to do things.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump Law does not concern itself with how you\u2019re supposed to do things. \u2018\u2018Donald would say, \u2018I hate lawyers who tell me that I can\u2019t do this or that,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Goldberg told me. And so Trump Lawyers don\u2019t. It was an arrangement that worked for Trump and his legal teams for years. And so it continues in Washington. Under Trump Law, it is perfectly fine for the president of China to stay as a guest at Mar-\u00ada-\u00adLago, for the lobbying arm of the Saudi government to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, for Trump to have a private dinner with the director of the F.B.I., James Comey, even as his agency was investigating Trump\u2019s campaign. Under Trump Law, it is O.K. for Trump not to divest himself of his assets or place them in a blind trust, and for the drafting and rollout of his Muslim travel ban to be overseen not by experienced government lawyers but by his 31-year-old senior adviser, Stephen Miller. Under Trump Law, Trump can appoint a national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, who had worked secretly as a paid lobbyist for Turkey, and fire Comey, as he himself explained, to relieve the pressure of the Russia investigation.\n\nTaking Trump Law to the Oval Office has produced new and unfamiliar varieties of legal troubles. Trump\u2019s Muslim ban is facing several constitutional challenges, and so is he, for multiple possible violations of the Emoluments Clause. Far from relieving the pressure of the Russia investigation, his firing of Comey prompted the appointment of a special counsel, who is also looking into whether Trump obstructed justice. Trump is barreling into these legal actions the same way he always has, publicly attacking not only his adversaries but also independent arbiters, calling defeats victories and staffing up with more and more Trump Lawyers.\n\nBut there may never be enough Trump Lawyers to get the job done. The work is hard, sometimes even humiliating. In fact, the one irreducible character trait of a Trump Lawyer is that he or she is willing to take on Trump as a client, one who often either doesn\u2019t solicit their advice or simply ignores it; who subverts their legal strategy on national television; who requires them to deny facts that he has confirmed and confirm facts that he has denied; who won\u2019t stop tweeting inflammatory, threatening and clearly false statements. It\u2019s a lot to ask of a professional. As Robert Luskin, a veteran Washington lawyer who represented Karl Rove in the Valerie Plame investigation, explains: \u2018\u2018There are folks who come to you because you have a certain expertise and folks who come to you because they have already figured out what they want and need, and they want to use you as a dinner fork.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWashington lawyers have defended spies, embezzlers, strongmen, torturers. But the prospect of defending Trump has apparently given them pause. Brendan Sullivan of Williams & Connolly, who represented Oliver North, and Ted Olson of Gibson, Dunn, who represented the Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, are among the veterans of Washington scandals who have reportedly rejected overtures to join Trump\u2019s legal defense team.\n\nGoldberg, too, has been approached about taking on a role on the team. When we met, he had just returned from Washington, where he consulted with a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office on some of the legal questions surrounding obstruction of justice. This is a field in which Goldberg has some experience. In 1970, he defended Lansky\u2019s muscle, Vincent (Jimmy Blue Eyes) Alo (the character Johnny Ola in \u2018\u2018The Godfather, Part II\u2019\u2019), against charges that he had interfered with an S.E.C. investigation into stock fraud.\n\n\u2018\u2018He asked me whether I would be interested or involved in a major way,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg said of the White House lawyer he met with, before quickly telling me to forget he had even mentioned the subject. \u2018\u2018I went not of my own accord. I\u2019ll leave it that way. I shouldn\u2019t say any more.\u2019\u2019\n\nI asked Goldberg if he was considering accepting the lawyer\u2019s invitation. He was not. \u2018\u2018Why would I run down there to be with those animals?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Because they\u2019re animals, that\u2019s what they are.\u2019\u2019 To the Trump Lawyer, the problem could never be Trump: That\u2019s the first rule of Trump Law. Instead, Goldberg had his own explanation for Trump\u2019s current legal difficulties: \u2018\u2018He\u2019s trying to break in a new pair of shoes, and they won\u2019t let him.\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Jonathan Mahler"], "publish_date": "2017-07-05", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["lawyers", "trump", "office", "washington", "lawyer", "goldberg", "trumps", "president", "presidents", "law", "legal"], "summary": "Reality-\u00adbending litigators who favor bold claims over careful persuasion, Trump Lawyers enabled \u2014 and in many ways, defined \u2014 Trump\u2019s surreal New York rise.\n\u2018\u2018Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?\u2019\u2019 Trump said of himself at a campaign rally in January 2016.\n\u2018\u2018Lawyers were making journeys to Mr. Trump\u2019s office to represent him for nothing, just for the publicity,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg told me.\nLike Trump, Trump Lawyers tend to have something of an attention-\u00adgrabbing rebellious streak: Sekulow, who grew up Jewish in Brooklyn, now identifies as a messianic Jew; he believes that Jesus is the messiah.\nTrump Lawyers practice Trump Law."}
