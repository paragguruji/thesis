But a judge in Hawaii who ruled on Wednesday appears to have concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s true motivations could be found by looking at his earlier remarks.\n\n\u201cThese plainly worded statements,\u201d wrote Judge Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu, \u201cbetray the executive order\u2019s stated secular purpose.\u201d\n\nHours later, a second judge in Maryland also ruled against the core portions of the new travel ban, also citing Mr. Trump\u2019s promise as a candidate to enact a ban on entry into the United States by Muslims.\n\nJudge Theodore D. Chuang of Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md. wrote that the likely purpose of Mr. Trump\u2019s new order was \u201cthe effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nThe president and his aides deny that the president is targeting Muslims and have insisted that a temporary ban on travel for refugees and visitors from predominantly Muslim nations \u2014 seven that were singled out in Mr. Trump\u2019s first order and six in his most recent revision \u2014 is necessary so that security officials can ensure proper vetting is conducted to prevent threats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe courts have not agreed.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first attempt to impose a travel ban was blocked by a federal judge in Washington State after several days of chaos in which travelers, including permanent residents and those holding valid United States visas, were prevented from entering.\n\nThe judge in the first case said there was no support for Mr. Trump\u2019s argument \u201cthat we have to protect the U.S. from individuals from these countries.\u201d An appeals court later agreed that the government had provided \u201cno evidence\u201d of a threat from those countries.\n\nIn the White House, Mr. Trump and his advisers say those courts were wrong, but they chose to write a narrower travel ban in the hopes of avoiding a lengthy legal battle that might take them all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nNow, the decision by the two judges to block even that narrower ban raises new questions about the administration\u2019s legal acumen and undercuts its political strategy of seeking to move quickly to make good on the president\u2019s promises.\n\nEnraged, Mr. Trump lashed out during a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, accusing the Honolulu judge of ruling against him for political reasons and lamenting that the decision \u201cmakes us look weak.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, being made to look weak by the court system may be the most infuriating part of his repeated legal losses.\n\nDuring his campaign, the president displayed little patience with the courts, questioning one judge\u2019s impartiality by accusing him \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 of being a \u201cMexican.\u201d And after the judge in Seattle blocked his first travel ban in February, Mr. Trump called him a \u201cso-called judge\u201d on Twitter.\n\nThe White House may yet be vindicated. An appeals court might decide that the judge in Honolulu erred in his assessment of the new, more narrowly drawn travel ban. Or the Supreme Court could eventually intervene on his behalf.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the political damage may already be done.\n\nThe first attempt at a travel ban by Mr. Trump and his senior aides \u2014 including Stephen Miller, his top adviser on immigration issues \u2014 was seen by many as a botched attempt to rush a complicated policy into effect with no planning.\n\nVideo\n\nNow, their second attempt, which was drafted with more care and was vetted with experts throughout the agencies, has been called into question as well.\n\nIt is unclear how the government will respond to the legal challenge. The judge in Hawaii conceded that Mr. Trump\u2019s past statements would not \u201cforever taint any effort\u201d by the administration to address security concerns.\n\nHe left open the possibility that another version of a travel ban might pass muster with the court.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration was evident at the rally in Nashville, where he mused about returning to the first version of his travel ban \u2014 without explaining how he would get around the courts\u2019 earlier rulings.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d Mr. Trump told his enthusiastic supporters, echoing the simpler days of the campaign, when courts did not get in the way. \u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way. The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, even now, the president may not fully appreciate the power \u2014 and the implications \u2014 of his words.\n\nAt the rally, Mr. Trump offered more verbal ammunition to support the critiques of the travel ban. The president called his latest effort to restrict entry merely \u201ca watered-down version\u201d of his first attempt, which was also blocked by the courts.\n\nThose words could easily serve to undermine his own lawyers, who have argued strenuously that Version 2.0 of the travel ban is different enough that it should pass legal muster.\n\nIn the near future, the president may find an appeals court judge once again citing his words in support of a ruling that he doesn\u2019t like.", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": "Michael D.
