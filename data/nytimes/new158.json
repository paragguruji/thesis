Officials Should Quit if They Disagree With Trump, White House Warns", "text": "The reverberations extended beyond Washington. Corporate chieftains from Detroit to Silicon Valley sharply criticized the ban, saying it was inconsistent with their values. Mr. Trump also faced mounting legal challenges, as two Democratic-leaning states, Massachusetts and Washington, signaled they would attack the policy in court and a Muslim advocacy group filed a lawsuit calling it an unconstitutional religious test.\n\nAt the White House, where questions about the ban overshadowed all other issues on Monday, Mr. Spicer acknowledged the State Department\u2019s dissent channel has long been a way for its staff to register objections over administration policies. But he displayed little patience for it.\n\n\u201cThe president has a very clear vision,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cHe\u2019s been clear on it since the campaign, he\u2019s been clear on it since taking office \u2014 that he\u2019s going to put the country first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf somebody has a problem with that agenda,\u201d he added, \u201cthat does call into question whether or not they should continue in that post.\u201d\n\nThe visa ban has rattled other agencies, as well: the Defense Department, which says it hurts the military\u2019s local partners in conflict zones like Iraq; the Department of Homeland Security, whose customs officers are struggling to enforce the directive; and the Justice Department, whose lawyers are charged with defending its legality.\n\nBut Mr. Spicer\u2019s blunt warning posed an especially difficult choice for the more than 100 State Department officials who indicated they would sign the memo. They can sign a final version, which would be put on the desk of Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s designated secretary of state, on his first day in office. Or, they can choose not to identify themselves, and rely on the leak of the letter to make their point without identifying themselves.\n\nUnder State Department rules and whistle-blower laws, it is forbidden to retaliate against any employee who follows the procedures and submits a dissent memorandum. One of the signatories, in a text message, said State Department signatories were trying to figure out what to do.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

The sponsors quickly gathered more than 100 signatures, an unusually large number, but a draft of the memo was still being refined over the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast summer, 51 State Department officials signed one protesting President Barack Obama\u2019s policy in Syria, which they asserted had been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the violence there. They handed the cable to Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe State Department confirmed the existence of the memo on Monday, and it affirmed the right of its staff to dissent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More broadly, it represents objections to his efforts to cut back on American participation in international organizations and to issue ultimatums to allies.\n\nNot surprisingly, the diplomats and Civil Service officers of the State Department are among the most internationally minded in the government; they have lived around the world and devoted their careers to building alliances and promoting American values abroad.\n\nThat was reflected in parts of the draft of the dissent memo circulating in the State Department. It warned that the executive order \u201cwill increase anti-American sentiment,\u201d and that \u201cinstead of building bridges to these societies,\u201d it would \u201csend the message that we consider all nationals of these countries to be an unacceptable security risk.\u201d\n\nAmong those whose views will be changed are \u201ccurrent and future leaders in these societies \u2014 including those for whom this may be a tipping point toward radicalization.\u201d It also warned of an immediate humanitarian effect on those who come \u201cto seek medical treatment for a child with a rare heart condition, to attend a parent\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not need to alienate entire societies to stay safe,\u201d the memo concludes.\n\nOverseas, Iraqi officials said they were surprised by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media; they had not been consulted first. Objections from Baghdad are notable since Iraq is a front-line partner in the campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Pentagon, senior officials plan to send the White House a list of Iraqi citizens who have served with American forces with the recommendation that they be exempt from the visa ban. Officials said the Iraqis who would be put on the Defense Department list already had undergone a stringent form of vetting because they had served with the United States military in combat.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,\u201d Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said. \u201cThose who support us there and do so at risk to themselves, we will make sure those contributions of support, those personal risks they\u2019ve taken, are recognized in this process.\u201d\n\nCaptain Davis said department officials were compiling names of Iraqis who had served as drivers, interpreters, linguists and in other jobs with American military personnel in Iraq over the years. He declined to say how many Iraqi citizens might be included in the list or what Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s personal recommendations to Mr. Trump were on the matter.\n\nThe Pentagon list is intended to address a major criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order: that it will stop the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.", "authors": ["Mark Landler"], "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["warns", "trump", "state", "dept", "officials", "house", "memo", "trumps", "department", "disagree", "american", "sign", "secretary", "order", "quit", "white", "mr"], "summary": "But Mr. Spicer\u2019s blunt warning posed an especially difficult choice for the more than 100 State Department officials who indicated they would sign the memo.\nUnder State Department rules and whistle-blower laws, it is forbidden to retaliate against any employee who follows the procedures and submits a dissent memorandum.\nOne of the signatories, in a text message, said State Department signatories were trying to figure out what to do.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyLast summer, 51 State Department officials signed one protesting President Barack Obama\u2019s policy in Syria, which they asserted had been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the violence there.\nThe State Department confirmed the existence of the memo on Monday, and it affirmed the right of its staff to dissent."}
