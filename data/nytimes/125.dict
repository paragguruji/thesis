Designate Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization? Fall in line with Russia in dealing with the conflict in Syria?\n\n\u201cTrump has promised to do all kinds of things, but it\u2019s not clear what he will move on immediately,\u201d said Nathan J. Brown, a Middle East expert at George Washington University. \u201cNobody seems to know. It\u2019s not even clear if Trump knows.\u201d\n\nThe lack of unity stems from an old problem: Muslim leaders pay lip service to the \u201cummah,\u201d or global community of Muslims, but are more often driven by narrow national interests \u2014 even when faced with grave actions seen as an affront to their own people.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a strong basis of legitimacy at home,\u201d said Rami G. Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. \u201cThey are delicately perched between the anger of their own people and the anger they might generate from the American president.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which froze all refugee arrivals in the United States and barred the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days \u2014 has sent a whirlwind of confusion, anxiety and fury across the Middle East and Africa. Refugees have been turned back at airports, families separated indefinitely and long-planned trips upended.\n\n\u201cI thought in America, there were institutions and democracy,\u201d said Fuad Sharef, 51, an Iraqi Kurd bound for New York who was turned away from the Cairo airport with his wife and three children on Saturday morning. \u201cThis looks like a decision from a dictator. It\u2019s like Saddam Hussein.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Trump administration officials backtracked on one aspect of the order, saying green-card holders would be allowed to return to the United States. In a Facebook post on Sunday evening, Mr. Trump insisted that his policy was not a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and accused the news media of inaccurate reporting. Hours earlier, he had characterized the conflict with the Islamic State in starkly sectarian terms, asserting on Twitter: \u201cChristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, a majority of the Islamic State\u2019s victims have been Muslims, many of them shot, burned or beheaded. Among the Muslims who managed to escape Islamic State territory are the refugees Mr. Trump has now excluded.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Yet in much of the Middle East, Mr. Trump is less likely to get such a scolding.\n\nHe has drawn close to Mr. Sisi of Egypt, whom he called a \u201cfantastic guy,\u201d and is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Sisi\u2019s sworn enemy, a terrorist organization. In a call last week, the two leaders discussed a possible visit to the White House by Mr. Sisi, whose administration faces accusations of human rights abuses \u2014 an unthinkable prospect during the Obama administration.\n\nIn his order on Friday, whose stated aim is to keep extremists out of the United States, Mr. Trump invoked the Sept. 11 attacks three times. Yet Saudi Arabia, which was home to 15 of the 19 attackers, was not included on the list of countries whose citizens would be shut out. That reflects the deep economic and security ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump also has a personal financial link: In August 2015, just as his campaign was gathering steam, the Trump Organization registered eight companies in Saudi Arabia that were linked to a hotel development in the city of Jidda.\n\nPakistan, another country whose citizens have carried out attacks in the United States, also ducked Mr. Trump\u2019s list. Although Mr. Trump had a chummy phone call with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly after the election in November, Pakistanis are nervously waiting to see if Mr. Trump will pull American troops from neighboring Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern,\u201d said Zahid Hussain, a political analyst in Islamabad, Pakistan. \u201cFor now, they want to keep quiet and see how things go.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, King Abdullah II of Jordan is scheduled to meet in Washington with members of the Trump administration and Congress, the first Arab leader to do so since the executive order was issued.\n\nMuslim solidarity once existed. As recently as the early 2000s, most Muslim-majority countries agreed on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sanctions against Iraq. Now, after several regional wars and a surge in sectarian strife, that consensus has been shattered.\n\nMultinational organizations that represent Muslims are viewed as toothless entities. The head of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, which has headquarters in Saudi Arabia, was forced to quit last fall after he made a joke at the expense of Mr. Sisi of Egypt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the early days of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the Islamic scholars at Al Azhar, the ancient seat of Islamic learning in Cairo, spoke out against the \u201csmear campaigns being launched against Muslims in America.\u201d But the scholars have yet to weigh in on Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and even if they do, few observers expect them to stray from official Egyptian government policy.\n\nFor many citizens of those countries, the docility of their leaders is frustrating. Samer S. Shehata, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in Qatar, said that many of his students had already canceled their plans to study in the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is under any illusion that if you are a Muslim or an Arab, you\u2019re going to be treated different in this Trump presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Khouri, of the American University of Beirut, said the disconnect between rulers and civilians in some countries spoke to the underlying anger that fueled the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. \u201cEven when this American move is insulting Muslims and Islam, they do nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to create more anger, and more pressure, in the Arab world. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Declan Walsh", "type": "article"}
