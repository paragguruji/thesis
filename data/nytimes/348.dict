It was also an early verdict on the question of whether the White House can coerce cities and counties into helping federal immigration agents detain and deport immigrants who are not authorized to be in the country.\n\nMr. Trump has criticized judges who have ruled against him, and late Tuesday night the White House released a statement saying, \u201cOnce again, a single district judge \u2014 this time in San Francisco \u2014 has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country.\u201d\n\nExactly what makes a city or county a sanctuary is a matter of interpretation, but most that present themselves as sanctuaries, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston, limit how much they cooperate with federal immigration authorities, often by refusing to turn over unauthorized immigrants from local jails except under certain conditions or by preventing local police officers from asking about immigration status.\n\nIn San Francisco\u2019s case, the city argued that the executive order violated the Constitution by essentially trying to commandeer state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law. In practical terms, San Francisco\u2019s filing said, forcing the city to cooperate with federal immigration agents would threaten public safety by breaking trust between local authorities and immigrants, who the city argued would become less likely to report crimes or serve as witnesses.\n\nThe city estimated that it stood to lose more than $1 billion in federal funding as a result of the executive order. Santa Clara said about $1.7 billion, or more than a third of its revenue, was at risk.\n\nBreaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have courts \u2014 to halt the overreach of a president and an attorney general who either don\u2019t understand the Constitution or chose to ignore it,\u201d Dennis Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney, said in a statement. \u201cBecause San Francisco took this president to court, we\u2019ve been able to protect billions of dollars that fund lifesaving programs across this country.\u201d\n\nWhile the judge\u2019s order temporarily stops the White House from placing new restrictions on federal funding without going through Congress, it does not keep the administration from enforcing existing rules on federal grants. In letters to several local governments last week, the Justice Department warned that several current grants could be in jeopardy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his campaign and since taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked sanctuary cities as harboring lawbreakers. Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions have seemed particularly galled by San Francisco\u2019s policies, pointing multiple times to the killing of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot in San Francisco in 2015 by an immigrant with a record of multiple deportations.\n\nSanctuary cities \u201cbreed crime; there\u2019s a lot of problems,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News in February. \u201cIf we have to, we\u2019ll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California \u2014 California in many ways is out of control, as you know.\u201d\n\nBut as President Barack Obama was sometimes thwarted by conservative states and Republican-appointed judges, Mr. Trump has been stopped by liberal jurisdictions and, in this case, by an Obama appointee who had been a bundler for his 2008 campaign, according to OpenSecrets, a website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn court, lawyers for the government argued that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to end all aid to uncooperative sanctuary jurisdictions, the order was intended to do no more than highlight the president\u2019s commitment to hardening immigration enforcement. No more than a few small grants would be affected, they said.\n\nJudge Orrick\u2019s response: If that were true, what was the point?\n\n\u201cThe result of this schizophrenic approach to the order is that the counties\u2019 worst fears are not allayed and the counties reasonably fear enforcement under the order,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote that because the Constitution gives Congress the federal wallet, the president may not impose new conditions on federal funds to municipalities. The Supreme Court has held that the federal government cannot compel states to administer a federal program, the judge wrote, citing a case with very different partisan battle lines: National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the 2012 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not withhold Medicaid funding to force states to comply with Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd, Judge Orrick added, 10th Amendment restrictions on the power of the federal government require that the federal funds at stake be related to the policy in question, so that, for instance, housing funds cannot be yoked to immigration laws.\n\nSan Francisco became the first city to sue the administration over the executive order in January, arguing that the order\u2019s provision for cutting off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions was unconstitutional. Since then, at least five other local governments have sued, including Seattle; Richmond, Calif.; and two cities in Massachusetts, and others have vowed to do so if the administration moves to follow through on the executive order.\n\nBut, facing the prospect of losing millions in crucial funding and of a showdown with the Oval Office, multiple jurisdictions have already backed away from sanctuary-style policies since Mr. Trump was elected.", "publish_date": "2017-04-25", "authors": "Vivian Yee", "type": "article"}
