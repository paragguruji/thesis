The shop was among those that shut down, so he and his friends came to the rally, where they joked around and took selfies with their protest signs.\n\nDespite the convivial atmosphere, Mr. Obaya said he was concerned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset because Trump doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s best for Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bad order. People lives are going to be hurt.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNabil Ahmed Aljomai closed three Bronx stores that he owns as part of the strike.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to tell Mr. Trump that America is the greatest and we want to keep it the greatest in the American way, not in his way,\u201d Mr. Aljomai said. \u201cHis decision is racist and he\u2019s not supposed to make a decision like that.\u201d\n\nMr. Aljomai immigrated in 1992. He and his eight children are citizens, but he said he knew families whose members had different immigration statuses, raising the prospect of the ban dividing them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once they ban one group they can ban another group, and that\u2019s how people\u2019s rights get sent back to the Dark Ages.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Qatabi said that his great-grandfather had immigrated to the United States from Yemen early in the 20th century and that his grandfather had worked for Ford Motor Company.\n\n\u201cHow could people like us, who never engaged in violence or anything, be a threat?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been part of this country for a century.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYemen has been racked by political instability for years. Its long-serving authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was forced to resign in 2012 during the Arab Spring, but the country soon descended into a civil war between rival groups backed by Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe conflict led the United States to close its embassy in Sana, the capital, in 2015. Yemenis hoping to get to the United States have had to go to other countries, like Djibouti or Egypt, to apply for visas. Under President Barack Obama, some Yemenis had their United States passports confiscated at the embassy in Sana.\n\nDebbie Almontaser, president of the board of directors for the Muslim Community Network and an organizer of the protest, said many New Yorkers of Yemeni descent who had been working to bring relatives to the United States now had loved ones stranded in other countries overseas. She said the executive order had separated her brother-in-law from his wife and two children, who were in Jordan.\n\n\u201cIt is sad because now due to the Muslim ban there are many families that are unable to reunite,\u201d she said.", "publish_date": "2017-02-02", "authors": "Liam Stack", "type": "article"}
