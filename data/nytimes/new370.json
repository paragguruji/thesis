Even as Air Force One took off from a Maryland air base on Friday afternoon, headlines revealed new details about the swiftly expanding investigation into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers.\n\nQuestions about those headlines followed Mr. Trump across the globe, a reminder of the political troubles dogging him back home. But the president at least initially resisted the temptation to deviate from his diplomatic script to address reports that he had referred to James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, as \u201ca nut job\u201d during meetings with Russian officials in the Oval Office.\n\nAt his news conference, Mr. Tillerson said he did not have \u201cany information or knowledge\u201d about an unnamed White House official reported by The Washington Post to be a person of interest to investigators in the Russia case.\n\nThroughout his first day as America\u2019s top overseas ambassador, Mr. Trump posed for pictures, shook hands with his hosts and avoided his domestic turmoil.\n\nMr. Trump announced a nearly $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia as evidence of a renewed commitment by the United States to the security of the Persian Gulf region. The package includes precision weaponry that Mr. Obama had held up over concerns that it would be used to kill civilians in the war in neighboring Yemen, as well as an antimissile system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA forum bringing together American and Saudi corporate executives on Saturday also produced a series of multibillion-dollar deals. Among them: Lockheed Martin signed a $6 billion letter of intent to assemble 150 Black Hawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia, and General Electric announced projects it valued at $15 billion.\n\nCritics said the last thing the region needed was more arms. \u201cIn the powder keg that is the Middle East, this sale may simply light a fuse that sends the region, and us, deeper down the rabbit hole of perpetual military conflict,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote on HuffPost.\n\nMr. Trump himself had little to say publicly on Saturday, calling his first stop of his trip \u201ca tremendous day\u201d that would bring \u201chundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring two days here, the president is set to meet with dozens of leaders from the Persian Gulf and the wider Muslim world as he seeks to shape a new Middle East coalition. His current embrace of the Gulf nations differs sharply with some of his previous remarks. In 2014, before becoming a candidate for the White House, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cTell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s. Pay up!\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech that White House aides described as a call to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Muslim world to unite against extremism. One senior White House official said the president hoped to \u201creset\u201d both the global fight against Islamist terrorism and his own reputation for intolerance of Muslims, which was fueled by his campaign call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d After taking office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to temporarily block visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries, but courts have blocked it pending a legal review.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s royal hosts, whose country was not among those covered by the travel ban, have chosen to ignore that history in the interests of working with an American president who seems to share their goals and will not lecture them about repression of women or minority Shiites in Saudi Arabia, or its brutal conduct of the war in Yemen.\n\n\u201cTraditional Arab allies welcome the U.S. back because they believe it is largely on their terms: a U.S. that is clearly anti-Iran and anti-political Islam, a U.S. that de-emphasizes political reform and human rights, a U.S. that is in business mode and a White House that seems more accessible than in the past eight years,\u201d said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nBut Mr. Hokayem said Arab leaders might be in for a surprise over the long run. \u201cThere is a lot of projection and wishfulness in the Gulf view of Trump\u2019s America,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is plenty of inflated expectations.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nTamara Cofman Wittes, a former State Department official who worked on the Middle East under Mr. Obama, said Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of aligning with the Sunni states fundamentally conflicted with his desire for closer relations with Russia, which has sided with Iran in bolstering the government in Syria\u2019s civil war. Allowing President Bashar al-Assad to remain in power in Syria under Iran\u2019s thumb is precisely the outcome the Sunni states and Israel oppose, noted Ms. Wittes, who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump is the only sitting president to make Saudi Arabia the first stop on his inaugural, nine-day trip overseas.\n\nThe president and his wife, Melania, emerged from Air Force One against a stark desert backdrop on Saturday morning and were greeted on a long red carpet by King Salman, who was leaning on a cane, and other members of the Saudi royal family.\n\nMrs. Trump stood near her husband with her hair uncovered, as is common for visiting American first ladies. The country\u2019s tradition is for Saudi women to cover their heads in public. (In 2015, Mr. Trump criticized Michelle Obama on Twitter for not wearing a head scarf during an official visit here. Hillary Clinton and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also did not cover their hair during trips to the country.)\n\nKing Salman greeted Mr. Trump at the airport, a gesture he did not extend to Mr. Obama. Later, he bestowed the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud Medal, the nation\u2019s highest honor, on the new president, draping the gold medal and chain around Mr. Trump\u2019s neck. Previous recipients of the award include Mr. Obama, President George W. Bush, and Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia.\n\nA television microphone picked up the king\u2019s remarks to Mr. Trump. \u201cSyria, too, used to be one of the most advanced countries,\u201d the king said. \u201cWe used to get our professors from Syria. They served our kingdom. Unfortunately, they too brought destruction to their own country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could destroy a country in mere seconds,\u201d the king told the president, \u201cbut it takes a lot of effort.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael D.
