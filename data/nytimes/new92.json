Because no visas are required for travel by most European citizens to the United States, and because of the volume of tourism and business, restricting travel from Europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named.\n\nVideo\n\nBy Mr. Kurzman\u2019s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks \u2014 out of a total of more than 230,000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, one-1,870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings.\n\n\u201cMy advice to the new administration would be to declare victory,\u201d Mr. Kurzman said. For the average American, he added, \u201cyour odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal.\u201d\n\nBut terrorists \u2014 the root of the word means \u201cto cause to tremble\u201d \u2014 do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics. Their purpose is to terrify, and they use random and spectacular violence to do it, with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw.\n\nTo the rational calculations of Mr. Kurzman, one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years: Boston; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Orlando, Fla. \u2014 place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds, bullet-ridden bodies and frightened people running for cover. In Gallup polls, the number of Americans \u201cvery worried\u201d or \u201csomewhat worried\u201d about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent, with understandable spikes after new attacks.\n\nIn the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump\u2019s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with \u201chostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles\u201d or those \u201cwho do not support the Constitution.\u201d)\n\nThe trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cIt sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will \u201cfeed the jihadist narrative\u201d that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jonathan Schanzer, the vice president for research at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures, it might be justified.\n\nBut he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures, and no specific plans to address such issues during the temporary restrictions on visitors and refugees. \u201cThe order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Schanzer said he was frustrated that during the Obama administration, there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the United States and elsewhere. \u201cWe have several bloody, complex and interlocking conflicts in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts. Admittedly, that is not easy.\u201d\n\nMuch easier, clearly, is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense. But as the Trump administration is finding out, such pronouncements from an American president have many consequences, not all of them intended, anticipated or desired.", "authors": ["Scott Shane"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["administration", "reduce", "ban", "immigration", "unlikely", "terrorist", "american", "united", "states", "terrorism", "jihadist", "threat", "experts", "order", "muslim", "attacks", "mr", "say"], "summary": "If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings.\nThat cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism.\nAre you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is?\n\u201cIt sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said.\nThat, he said, will \u201cfeed the jihadist narrative\u201d that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence."}
