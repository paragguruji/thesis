London, meanwhile, has additionally restricted flights from some airports in Lebanon and Tunisia.\n\nThe targeting of a jetliner using explosives shows how the Islamic State, which has long worked to inspire terrorist attacks, is trying to compete with groups like Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Yemen. The Qaeda affiliate has spent years inventing explosives that are difficult to detect, including trying to disguise bombs in devices like cellphones. Now, American intelligence officials believe the Islamic State has also developed explosives that can be hidden in electronic devices, one of the senior counterterror officials said.\n\nRepresentative Peter King, Republican of New York, who sits on the House Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees, said that government officials had called him on Saturday to alert him to the impending ban.\n\n\u201cIt was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent,\u201d Mr. King said in a telephone interview. \u201cIntelligence of something possibly planned.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the restricted items on flights to the United States included laptop computers, tablets, cameras, travel printers and games bigger than a phone. The restrictions would not apply to aircraft crews, officials said in a briefing to reporters to outline the terms of the ban.\n\nThe American ban on electronics applies only to flights on foreign carriers. It does not affect American-operated airlines, since they do not fly directly to the United States from 10 designated airports in eight countries \u2014 Amman, Jordan; Cairo; Istanbul; Jidda and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia; Kuwait City; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Officials did not say how long the ban would remain in place or if other airports would be added.\n\nIn all, an estimated 50 flights each day into the United States would be affected. One of the world\u2019s busiest airports, in Abu Dhabi, already requires American-bound passengers to undergo strict screening by United States customs officials before boarding flights. Abu Dhabi is one of 15 airports in the world to employ the Homeland Security preclearance techniques.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral hours after the American action, the British government announced its own ban on electronic devices on flights.\n\nThe British ban affects domestic and foreign airlines, including British Airways, the country\u2019s largest. Foreign airlines affected by the order include Turkish Airlines, EgyptAir and Royal Jordanian, among others, and it affects direct flights to the United Kingdom from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

And the flight to the States is very long.\u201d\n\nThe Homeland Security Department\u2019s new ban appeared to take officials from some of the affected countries by surprise.\n\nAhmet Arslan, Turkey\u2019s transport, maritime and communication minister, said the ban would be harmful to the United States\u2019 airline industry \u2014 and to Turkey\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOur problem is not how the practice would take place,\u201d Mr. Arslan said. \u201cThe issue is, it can decrease the comfort of the passengers and reduce the numbers of passengers. We are emphasizing that this is not in the benefit of passengers, and we think that they should step back from this or ease it.\u201d\n\nCounterterrorism experts seemed equally divided over the need for the device ban.\n\nMichael Chertoff, the former Homeland Security secretary, said the new policy made sense given the threats to aircraft from explosive devices and concerns about screening at the targeted airports.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to balance security without making it impossible to fly,\u201d Mr. Chertoff said.\n\nBut Erroll Southers, director of the Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies Program at the University of Southern California, said the new guidance would do little to enhance security.\n\n\u201cThis does little to minimize the threat of a remote-controlled I.E.D.,\u201d he said, referring to improvised explosive devices hidden in checked baggage.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials did not cite threats against domestic airports, but one said the Transportation Security Administration has been on heightened alert at several airports. It was not clear if that alert was related to the new restrictions on electronic devices.\n\nThe restrictions follow other recent changes the T.S.A. has made in aviation security. Two weeks ago, the agency adopted enhanced pat-down searches for passengers at United States airports, a response to what it said were weaknesses in airport screening measures. Under the new rules, passengers will no longer be allowed to choose what type of searches they undergo in security lines.", "authors": ["Ron Nixon", "Adam Goldman", "Eric Schmitt"], "publish_date": "2017-03-21", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["passengers", "isis", "intelligence", "airports", "ban", "security", "officials", "united", "flights", "countries", "banned", "states", "devices", "fears"], "summary": "Now, American intelligence officials believe the Islamic State has also developed explosives that can be hidden in electronic devices, one of the senior counterterror officials said.\nIn all, an estimated 50 flights each day into the United States would be affected.\nOne of the world\u2019s busiest airports, in Abu Dhabi, already requires American-bound passengers to undergo strict screening by United States customs officials before boarding flights.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storySeveral hours after the American action, the British government announced its own ban on electronic devices on flights.\nTwo weeks ago, the agency adopted enhanced pat-down searches for passengers at United States airports, a response to what it said were weaknesses in airport screening measures."}
