So zealous about wanting fewer regulations, the farmers backed Donald Trump, not believing he\u2019d actually try to make good on his promise to deport illegal immigrants. Now the farmers are facing the specter of labor shortages.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The orchard owners and farmers were panicking, not having enough labor to harvest their crops. They were offering $125 a day, but no \u201cAmericans\u201d showed up to do the backbreaking work. Imagine that! What happened to: \u201cThe illegals are stealing our jobs\u201d?\n\nWell, we\u2019re about to find out just how much these \u201cillegals\u201d contribute to our society. When people start paying $3 a head for lettuce perhaps they\u2019ll wake up.\n\nYes, we need immigration reform, but this scorched-earth mentality is cruel, absurd and, ultimately, bad for our nation.\n\nMacKENZIE ALLEN\n\nSanta Fe, N.M.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201c \u2018Bad Dude\u2019? No, but Deported Anyway\u201d (editorial, Feb. 10):\n\nAs an American citizen and the daughter of immigrants, I\u2019m heartbroken that immigration officials elected to deport Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, a Mexican woman with two American-born children who has lived and worked in this country since the age of 14.\n\nMs. Rayos\u2019s only crime was to use someone else\u2019s Social Security number to obtain legal work. What is particularly galling about this is the fact that just five months after Ms. Rayos\u2019s arrest, the Supreme Court issued a ruling limiting the federal government\u2019s use of identity theft laws to go after undocumented immigrants trying to gain employment. If Ms. Rayos had been stopped a year later, she would have had no criminal conviction on her record, let alone a felony. She would not have faced deportation.\n\nIf President Trump wants to tighten immigration, he should concentrate his efforts on gang members and those convicted of violent crimes. To tear apart a family based on a law that our highest court ruled against is a travesty of justice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSUZANNE CHAZIN\n\nChappaqua, N.Y.\n\nThe writer is the author of a series of novels about the undocumented.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-02-10", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["generation", "travel", "trump", "ban", "immigrants", "immigration", "setback", "trumps", "work", "try", "sign", "undocumented", "york", "farmers", "legal"], "summary": "This is Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, and why the Muslim travel ban will be remembered as a vestige of bigotry.\nCARLA BENSONSpokane, Wash.To the Editor:Re \u201cFarmers Backed Trump; Now They\u2019re Worried\u201d (news article, Feb. 10):This is a classic example of myopic voting.\nMs. Rayos\u2019s only crime was to use someone else\u2019s Social Security number to obtain legal work.\nIf President Trump wants to tighten immigration, he should concentrate his efforts on gang members and those convicted of violent crimes.\nTo tear apart a family based on a law that our highest court ruled against is a travesty of justice."}
