Under normal procedures, a case granted for review this late in the term would be argued by Thanksgiving with a possible resolution as late as June 2018. This case, indeed this president, is anything but normal. The legality of the travel ban, which implicates the commander in chief\u2019s core statutory and constitutional authority over national security, demands an immediate resolution by the Supreme Court \u2014 one way or the other.\n\nWhen necessary, the justices have quickly answered separation-of-powers disputes in less than a month\u2019s time. Here, such a speedy resolution is essential not only to address the legality of this executive order but, more broadly, to signal to the lower courts how to treat President Trump\u2019s unprecedented behavior in this case and beyond. With all the briefs scheduled to be filed on Monday, the court should follow its practice from previous urgent cases: Schedule argument for 10 days hence, with a resolution as soon as practicable. Letting this issue linger over the summer, or longer, would deny the parties, the courts and our republic what is truly needed: finality.\n\nFor a road map of how to proceed with all deliberate speed, look no further than the famous Steel Seizure Case, decided during the height of the Korean War. On April 8, 1952, President Harry S. Truman ordered his secretary of commerce to take control of American steel mills to avert a labor strike. He resolved that nationalizing the mills was essential to securing supply lines overseas. Although Truman was fond of saying \u201cthe buck stops here,\u201d ultimately the decision would rest with the Supreme Court. After a month filtering through the lower courts, on June 2, the justices invalidated the seizures. From start to finish, they resolved a constitutional conflict in less than a month.\n\nThere would be two more judicial blitzes during the tumultuous 1970s. The landmark First Amendment decision known as the Pentagon Papers Case rocketed through the federal judiciary in less than three weeks. On June 12, 13 and 14 of 1971, The New York Times published a classified study about the Vietnam War. The next day, a federal judge in Manhattan granted a remarkable injunction, ordering The Times to cease distribution of the Pentagon Papers. On June 23, the Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court\u2019s judgment. Less than 24 hours later, The Times filed its appeal with the Supreme Court. On June 26, at 11 a.m., less than two hours after the printed briefs had arrived, the justices heard oral arguments. Four days later, following what Justice John M. Harlan referred to in dissent as a \u201cfrenzied train of events,\u201d the court ruled for The Times.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

On May 1, 1974, President Richard Nixon began his last stand, fighting in court a subpoena that ordered him to release Oval Office tapes. After the lower courts ruled against him, Nixon appealed to the Supreme Court, and review was granted nine days later. Delaying their summer vacation, the justices scheduled arguments for July 8. Two weeks later, the court unanimously ruled that Nixon had to release the tapes. And two weeks after that foundational decision, the 37th president resigned.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe transition from the Carter to the Reagan administration would bring one of the most momentous constitutional cases of the past half-century. As part of the negotiations to free the hostages from the United States embassy in Tehran, Reagan issued an executive order in February 1981 that would suspend all pending litigation against the Iranian government. The Dames & Moore company, which was owed more than $3 million by the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, challenged the constitutionality of the executive order on April 28, 1981. After the case zipped through the lower courts, the Supreme Court granted review on June 11, 1981, explaining that \u201cthe issues presented here are of great significance and demand prompt resolution.\u201d All parties were ordered to file their briefs eight days later and oral arguments were heard on June 24. After another eight days, Justice William H. Rehnquist issued a unanimous decision, upholding Reagan\u2019s actions. Again, the entire case was resolved by the court in one month.", "publish_date": "2017-06-11", "authors": "Josh Blackman", "type": "article"}
