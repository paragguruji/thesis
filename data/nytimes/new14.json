The court said the travel ban could not be imposed on anyone who had \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u5e7f\u544a\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion sets up a historic legal clash this fall in which the justices will weigh the president\u2019s power to set national security priorities against the need to protect individuals from discrimination based on their religious beliefs or national origin.\n\nIn saying they will take the case, the court partly endorsed the administration\u2019s view that the president has vast powers to control who crosses the border. The court said the president\u2019s powers to limit immigration \u201care undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the opinion also signaled that some of the justices might believe Trump exceeded even that broad authority when he twice sought to impose a blanket ban on entry into the United States from particular, Muslim-majority countries. With the limits imposed Monday by the court, the government\u2019s travel ban will be far more limited than the one he proposed in his first week in office and a later, revised ban.", "authors": ["Michael D.
