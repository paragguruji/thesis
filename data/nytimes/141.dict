{"title": "In Ban on Migrants, Trump Supporters See a Promise Kept", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/migrants-ban-trump-supporters.html?mcubz=0", "text": "But emotions are powerful forces, and much of what people know comes from smartphone and tablet screens showing an endless stream of news of terrorist attacks that feel immediate and threatening even if they are far away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge my grandma who never met a Muslim in her life, but all she sees on TV are Muslims blowing things up,\u201d said Mr. Bower, 35, who grew up in rural Idaho. \u201cIt is not irrational that people are worried.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was \u201conly temporary.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just take a breather,\u201d Mr. Bower said. \u201cTake a little time out. Let\u2019s get the smart people in here and formulate a plan.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEach person sees the policy through the lens of personal experience. For Mr. Bower, it evokes his stepsister, whose husband works in Lower Manhattan and was there on Sept. 11. He was on one of the last trains out of the city that morning and, even now, Mr. Bower said, she is scared every day her husband goes to work.\n\n\u201cI guess I would probably say I adopted my sister\u2019s view,\u201d he said. \u201cI see how it affects her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to re-examine what we are doing.\u201d\n\nMr. Bower, a college-educated Republican, said he voted for Mr. Trump largely to avoid voting for Hillary Clinton. He said he is watching what the president does and would not support him unconditionally. He said he was politically lonely in blue Seattle, but wanted to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt. The immigration order did nothing to dampen his enthusiasm.\n\nFor Louis Murray, 52, a life insurance salesman in Boston, Mr. Trump\u2019s order left him \u201cecstatic.\u201d He recalled the Tsarnaev brothers, who were from a Muslim-majority part of the former Soviet Union, entered the United States on tourist visas and then applied for asylum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey said they were in fear of their lives,\u201d he said, \u201cbut yet they went back there for terrorist training. And they repaid our kindness of refugee status with a triple murder and a pressure-cooker bomb put on the Boston Marathon finish line. I can remember our whole city and region being on lockdown, and it was sheer terror.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

A Quinnipiac University poll in January found that, by a ratio of 48 to 42 percent, voters supported \u201csuspending immigration from \u2018terror prone\u2019 regions, even if it means turning away refugees from those regions.\u201d And a December Politico/Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health poll found that 50 percent of Americans favored \u201cbanning future immigration from regions where there are active terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nOpinion on the subject breaks sharply along partisan lines. A New York Times/CBS poll in July found that two in three Trump supporters favored a temporary ban on allowing Muslims to enter the country, while 87 percent of Clinton voters opposed it.\n\nEvents are fluid, and after the administration\u2019s retreat on Sunday from barring holders of green cards from re-entering the country, some experts suggested that Mr. Trump might be calculating his actions to provoke liberals.\n\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, or do you know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump goes out of his way to offend nearly everything the left values,\u201d said Philip E. Tetlock, a political psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of \u201cSuperforecasting.\u201d \u201cHe even takes glee in it.\u201d\n\nIt also may serve his purposes, if an angry left riles up the right, heightening the sense of battle on both sides \u2014 and endearing him to his supporters even more.\n\n\u201cThe liberal media spent all their time and effort bashing him, laughing at him, saying he wasn\u2019t fit,\u201d said Don Broesch, a retired accountant from Germantown, Wis., who said it seemed as if every single story about Mr. Trump during the campaign was negative. \u201cWhen there\u2019s an underdog out there, and they are totally criticizing him, all it does is drum up support for him. It makes me like him even more. I love it when they bash him because it tells me he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Broesch and his wife, Lynn, strongly support the immigration order. Mrs. Broesch said she had been wary of Muslims since Sept. 11, but had a new surge of worry after the knife attack by a Somali-American last year in a mall in Minnesota, where her son and his family live.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has been sharply critical of the news media as elitist and out of touch and has stirred the pot of class divide. It is hard to say what part of the resentment his supporters feel has arisen from their own direct experience and what part has seeped in from the political air. Often it seems to come from both.\n\nMr. Oliva contended that the media portrays Muslim immigrants only positively.\n\n\u201cEvery story about a Muslim immigrant is that they are as American as apple pie,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry, Islam is no friend of L.G.B.T. people. When Islam meets gay people in Somalia or wherever, they get thrown off the roof. And you expect them to be different when they move here? You can\u2019t expect people to absorb our values.\u201d\n\nMr. Oliva, who works on the Upper East Side of Manhattan \u2014 and recently had a picture of Mr. Trump\u2019s face tattooed on his arm \u2014 said people in Manhattan did not understand his love for Mr. Trump because their problems were different from his.\n\nLast month, he said, he was waiting for the M101 bus with an Uber package when he struck up a conversation with a well-dressed woman. Watching a snarl of traffic, she blamed Mr. Trump for it. Mr. Oliva told her he loved Mr. Trump and could not wait for him to take action against immigrants in the country illegally, who he said had hurt his weekend income as a house painter.\n\n\u201cThese people in Manhattan, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the outer boroughs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese immigrants, they don\u2019t come to 86th Street; they come to Port Richmond Avenue on Staten Island.\u201d He added that Manhattanites are \u201cnot going to be affected. We are the ones that feel it.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Sabrina Tavernise", "type": "article"}
