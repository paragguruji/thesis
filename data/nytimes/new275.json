The Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film \u201cThe Salesman\u201d is up for a foreign-language Academy Award, said he would not attend this weekend\u2019s Oscars ceremony. It said the Syrian singer Omar Souleyman might not be able to perform in New York in May, and it was unclear whether the Paris-based Syrian poet Adonis, who is 87, would be able to attend PEN\u2019s World Voices Festival in New York in May. That literary festival was founded by Salman Rushdie to foster literary conversation across borders and promote free expression.\n\nGeorge Packer, the author and staff writer for The New Yorker, said he was under no illusions about the efficacy of signing his name to a letter like this. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to change any minds at the top of the Trump administration, but perhaps it will give heart to officials lower down, and to foreigners who wonder if America is losing what makes it great,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Why throw it away?\u201d\n\nThe novelist Rick Moody said he hoped the letter would help in \u201ckeeping the resistance alive.\u201d \u201cOr, ideally,\u201d he added, \u201cbudging the needle on policy a bit.\u201d And the writer Susan Orlean echoed that sentiment: \u201cI think this is the time to be noisy \u2014 to be loud about disagreeing when it comes to matters of essential unfairness.\u201d\n\nThe cartoonist Jules Feiffer said he had signed the letter because at 88, \u201cI\u2019m too old to march.\u201d He said he was keeping his spirits up. \u201cDoctors say that enlisting in a fight over the life or death of this American nation affects the spirit like a miracle drug. I have never been more hopeful.\u201d\n\nAnd though the novelist Jeffrey Eugenides said he was quite sure that sending this letter was akin to \u201cshouting into a void,\u201d something he\u2019s used to as a fiction writer, he was still hopeful. \u201cI\u2019ve also been surprised, in the past, at how often the void shouts back,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s the letter:", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "publish_date": "2017-02-21", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["syrian", "65", "writers", "reconsider", "urge", "trump", "world", "ban", "void", "packer", "writer", "novelist", "times", "sign", "open", "york", "artists", "visa", "letter"], "summary": "The letter noted how the original visa ban last month had disrupted cultural life.\nThat literary festival was founded by Salman Rushdie to foster literary conversation across borders and promote free expression.\nSign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s openness to foreigners has earned us affection and respect around the world even in dark times."}
