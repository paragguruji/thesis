In February, Trump tweeted \u201cLAWFARE\u201d and quoted a line Wittes wrote criticizing the Court of Appeals ruling that blocked the administration\u2019s Jan. 27 refugee-and-travel ban. The president was probably reacting to the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d which aired the same quote on-screen just before the president\u2019s tweet. Trump presumably didn\u2019t realize that in that piece and an earlier one, Wittes shredded the January ban as the product of \u201cincompetent malevolence\u201d and supported the court\u2019s decision over all. \u201cYou decide whether the POTUS is quoting me in context,\u201d Wittes tweeted back, linking to his post on the court ruling.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

In January, Ira Glass invited Wittes on \u201cThis American Life\u201d to talk about the January refugee-and-travel ban. \u201cTwo days ago, I\u2019d never heard of you, and now you\u2019re my new best friend,\u201d Glass wrote to Wittes. There\u2019s something very unlikely about liberals\u2019 embracing Lawfare: Before Trump, the blog\u2019s closeness to the national-security community made it \u201csomewhat disreputable\u201d to the left, Wittes told me, half-kiddingly. Lawfare observes rules that most publications don\u2019t, including a pledge never to publish classified information. Contributors generally tend to be hawkish and \u201cmore sympathetic to the executive, and more accepting of the seriousness of the counterterrorism threat and the need for tools like targeting and surveillance, than a lot of writers in the national-security space,\u201d Goldsmith says.\n\nLawfare writers criticized aspects of Obama\u2019s policy on drone killings but also explained and defended the surrounding legal arguments. Reproving Edward Snowden for exposing the broad spying powers of the National Security Agency, Wittes called him a \u201ccivil liberties violator.\u201d Before that, in 2012, the journalist and lawyer who published many of the Snowden revelations, Glenn Greenwald, derided Lawfare and Wittes in The Guardian for expressing a \u201ccourtier Beltway mentality\u201d devoted to \u201cserving, venerating and justifying the acts of those in power.\u201d Inside Lawfare, the insult was converted into an ironic self-description: \u201cHandmaiden of Power.\u201d As a joke gift, a former Lawfare editor gave Wittes a Handmaiden of Power plaque, which now hangs on his office wall next to a framed copy of Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cWe realized it was a pretty great visual depiction of the changing times,\u201d Lawfare\u2019s managing editor, Susan Hennessey, emailed me.\n\nIn the Trump era, Lawfare has found itself in the unfamiliar position of airing an outpouring of fury at the government. The blog covered with alacrity the leaks that led to the resignation of Mike Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, along with criticizing them. In a couple of widely circulated posts, Goldsmith flayed the administration (in particular the White House counsel, Don McGahn) for what he called the \u201cFlynn imbroglio.\u201d The blog was the first to publish the (nonclassified) dissent memo, objecting to the Jan. 27 refugee-and-travel ban, which was signed by a thousand State Department employees. \u201cConsider this a major bureaucratic uprising on the part of career foreign service officers against the president,\u201d Wittes wrote with Hennessey and Quinta Jurecic, an associate editor.\n\nAs the ground shifts beneath Lawfare, the blog has aired a debate over whether its identity is shifting as well. The day after the election, Wittes announced that he thought his job as a writer and an analyst had fundamentally changed. \u201cIn a way I never did with George W. Bush or Barack Obama or Bill Clinton,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI will write about the actions of the Trump presidency with the working assumption that our nation must be protected both by and from the president.\u201d (Greenwald tweeted in response: \u201cThis is the skepticism that citizens, and especially journalists, should apply to *all* Presidents. But either way, welcome @benjaminwittes!\u201d) Chesney, however, clarified that Lawfare has no collective editorial stance.\n\nOne big question is whether Lawfare contributors will rethink their general (if not universal) promotion of a strong theory of executive power. Is the enhanced power of the presidency a loaded gun that Bush and Obama handed Trump with the support of the national-security community that Lawfare often represents? \u201cI\u2019m an unabashed apologist for strong national-security authority,\u201d Wittes says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I might be more alarmed by Trump. If you believe, as I do, that the scope and range of presidential authority is great, that puts a lot of weight on the civic virtue and decency of the individual who holds the office.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Lawfare contributors have sparred with their equally knowledgeable but generally more liberal counterparts on another smart and topical legal blog called Just Security. Some Just Security writers seem to think they\u2019ve essentially won the argument. \u201cLawfare has typically supported a strong executive on national security and intelligence matters,\u201d David Cole, the national legal director of the A.C.L.U., wrote to me in an email. \u201cNow that Donald Trump is president, its authors are beginning to see the real perils of that position. The last thing anyone wants is an unchecked President Trump.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith\u2019s criticism of the Trump administration carries particular weight because of the role he played in constraining executive power during the Bush years. In 2004, when he was head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, he withdrew legal memos that allowed for the torture of those suspected of terrorism, and then resigned in part to make the withdrawal stick. (He thought the timing would make it hard for the White House to reverse his decision without making it seem as if he had resigned in protest.) Goldsmith has argued for having faith in the institutional and legal checks that were strengthened during Bush\u2019s second term, and continued during Obama\u2019s years in office. \u201cThey\u2019re working extraordinarily well,\u201d he says, pointing to the court rulings on the January refugee-and-travel ban \u2014 \u201cwe saw the law bite Trump hard\u201d \u2014 and the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation of ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials. That was \u201ca hugely important step toward inevitable accountability,\u201d Goldsmith argues. Trump is \u201ca president who has systematically defied the norms that define his office,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat can be very corrosive, so it makes me nervous.\u201d But looking further ahead, Goldsmith is also anticipating an unexpected consequence of containing Trump, which could fall on future chief executives: \u201cThe checks and balances may be working so well that the presidency will emerge as too weak.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-03-14", "authors": "Emily Bazelon", "type": "article"}
