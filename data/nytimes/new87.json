Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nThe United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief fund-raiser for U.S.A. Wrestling and a 1984 Greco-Roman Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran\u2019s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, \u2018We can\u2019t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fraser said.\n\nWhile Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the so-called Ping-Pong diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s.\n\nIn wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I.O.C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U.S.A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,\u201d Ms. Kelley said.\n\nThe ban on visitors from the seven nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 comes at a delicate time for the U.S.O.C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games.\n\n(There is some speculation that the I.O.C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U.S.O.C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.)\n\nDavid Wallechinsky, an American member of the I.O.C.\u2019s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles\u2019s bid with I.O.C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being \u201canti-Muslim, anti-woman and anti-Latino.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall across America\u2019s southern border.\n\n\u201cI think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn\u2019t in the White House,\u201d Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid.\u201d International perceptions of the Trump administration \u201cmatter, for sure,\u201d Mr. Gulati said, \u201cbut I think those will be developed in the months to come.\u201d\n\nU.S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\n\nMany questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N.B.A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.)\n\nMr. Maker\u2019s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order.\n\nMr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen.\n\nThe N.B.A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league\u2019s All-Star weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year\u2019s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza Shah-Ravesh from Iran.\n\nMajor League Soccer has two American-born players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran\u2019s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, is a Nike-sponsored athlete coached by Alberto Salazar.\n\nEarly Sunday morning Mr. Farah\u2019s Facebook page had a post that, among other things, said: \u201cOn 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years - working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome.\u201d\n\nAbdi Abdirahman, a four-time Olympian for the United States who finished third in the 2016 New York City Marathon, was also born in Somalia, and the race regularly attracts runners from around the globe. The 2016 race featured three runners from Iran, nine from Syria and one from Sudan in the field of about 50,000 runners.\n\n\u201cOur goal is always to recruit the world\u2019s best and cleanest athletes, regardless of where they\u2019re from,\u201d Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in an email.\n\nJackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for track and field\u2019s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, \u201cWe clearly need to understand the implications of this new U.S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect\u201d the sport\u2019s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore., in 2021.\n\nPhil Andrews, the chief executive of U.S.A. Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on the world weight-lifting championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, Calif., and on the American team\u2019s participation at a competition in Iran.\n\n\u201cOur view is that politics and sport should be separate,\u201d Mr. Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. \u201cWe sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November. It is unimaginable to be able to host a true world event without their participation.\u201d", "authors": ["Jer\u00e9 Longman"], "publish_date": "2017-01-28", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["iran", "world", "wrestling", "trump", "los", "immigration", "big", "united", "states", "trumps", "bid", "impact", "order", "mr"], "summary": "Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s order.\nOne of the most celebrated examples is the so-called Ping-Pong diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s.\nIn wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I.O.C.\nShe said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\nplayers, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order."}
