There were too many to fit into the small border office for processing, so the people of the town rushed to open the community hall, where the new arrivals could get warm, doze on sleeping mats and refuel on Nutella sandwiches, tea and coffee.\n\nPhoto\n\nNoting a worrying trend, Emerson officials convened an emergency meeting on Thursday with the police and border agents to figure out a protocol for the next wave of arrivals \u2014 which they feared would be soon.\n\n\u201cThe farmers are worried about what they\u2019re going to find when the snow melts,\u201d said Greg Janzen, the reeve, or chief elected executive, of the Emerson-Franklin municipality.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, two Ghanaians were picked up on the roadside north of town, some 10 hours after they had set off into a field near the border, sinking to their waists in snow. The temperature that morning was reported to be below zero, with windchill making it even worse. The men\u2019s hands were so badly frostbitten that they lost almost all their fingers.\n\nOver the past couple of years, a small number of people have been sneaking across the border at Manitoba from the United States and then filing for asylum, Canadian Border Service Agency statistics show. But since the fall, refugee workers in Winnipeg say, there has been a noticeable surge.\n\nThe Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, known locally as Welcome Place, typically serves 50 to 60 asylum seekers per year, said its executive director, Rita Chahal. \u201cSince April, we\u2019ve seen already 300,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the government of Canada was unable to provide statistics on the number of people seeking refugee status who illegally enter the country, Sgt. Harold Pfleiderer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said, \u201cThere has been an increase in illegal migration in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, with the largest increase being seen in Quebec.\u201d\n\nCANADA Red River 75 Emerson MANITOBA Noyes 29 75 St. Vincent MINNESOTA 1 Mile Red River\n\nA loophole in the rules covering asylum seekers has led some to walk for as long as eight hours in the middle of the night, through wintry landscapes and biting prairie cold, before arriving in Emerson. While an agreement between Canada and the United States makes it impossible for them to simply present themselves at the border and claim asylum, those who make it into the country and then present themselves to border guards can do so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, in light of the uncertainty and disruption created by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, refugee advocates and human rights groups in Canada are demanding that the government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspend or cancel the refugee pact, which is known as the Safe Third Country agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are essentially encouraging people to come across the border through irregular means,\u201d said Sean Rehaag, a York University law professor who specializes in refugee and immigration law.\n\nOn Wednesday, the immigration and refugee clinical program at Harvard Law School issued a report stating that Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration made the United States \u201cnot a safe country of asylum\u201d for people fleeing persecution and violence.\n\n\u201cWhen Canada sends someone back to the U.S., we are saying we have confidence the U.S. is going to protect them if they need protection. We don\u2019t see how we can have confidence to say that in the current context,\u201d said Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council For Refugees, a nonprofit umbrella organization of 170 refugee advocacy groups.\n\nBashir Khan, a Winnipeg lawyer, has represented 125 refugees before the Immigration and Refugee Board over the past five years. That is on top of the 17 he is representing currently. All were rejected at refugee hearings in the United States.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest here,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cThey did not get access to justice in the United States. They were locked up from the moment they crossed the Mexican border, and detained an average of nine months. They didn\u2019t know how to fill out asylum forms, they were not given legal aid \u2014 not one of them.\u201d\n\nMs. Chahal of Welcome Place said that in recent months her center had seen another type of applicant \u2014 people like Mourad Hassan, who flew into Chicago in December and then worked immediately to find a way across the border to make his first asylum claim in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen Trump became president, I was scared he would deport me,\u201d said Mr. Hassan, 32, a former army officer from Djibouti who said he had been tortured for political reasons. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like Muslims.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The hearings are usually scheduled within two to three months of their application, but there are no guarantees. In 2015 the Immigration and Refugee Board approved 57.7 percent of the 16,521 refugee claims made inside Canada\u2019s borders. The quasi-judicial board does not track how many claims come from people who bypassed border controls to enter Canada.\n\nWith the legal status of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order still in limbo, Canada\u2019s government has shown no enthusiasm for suspending its agreement with Washington.\n\nOn Friday, Camielle Edwards, a spokeswoman for Ahmed Hussen, the immigration minister, said that the agreement \u201cremains an important tool for Canada and the U.S. to work together on the orderly handling of refugee claims made in our countries.\u201d She said, \u201cThe conditions of the agreement continue to be met, but we are continuing to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Dench said that history suggests that Canada\u2019s border will not be overwhelmed by refugee claimants if people entering from the United States are allowed to apply at the border. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if everyone in the U.S. would suddenly want to come to Canada,\u201d she said. And, she said, \u201cWe would not have more people crossing the border irregularly and you no longer have people losing their fingers.\u201d\n\nMr. Yussuf was prepared for his journey to Emerson. He wore thermal underwear and thick gloves. And he paid a guide $600 to take him close to the border.\n\nOther asylum seekers said that they had heard from cabdrivers in Grand Forks, N.D., that they would be deported at the border. The drivers offered to drive them to a place that was better for crossing illegally, but farther from the border.\n\nThey were unprepared for the wintry crossing. One man, Zurekaneni Issah Adams, wore a thin jean jacket and carpentry gloves. His trip took seven hours.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky. We were saved by God,\u201d said Mr. Adams, 36, who fled Ghana in 2014 for Brazil, before slowly making his way by foot, bus and boat to the California border.\n\nAfter 16 months in detention, Mr. Adams said, his asylum request there was rejected. In Canada, he had a hearing scheduled last week, but it was postponed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am dreaming big,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not lose my hope.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-02-11", "authors": "Catherine Porter, Dan Levin and Ian Austen", "type": "article"}
