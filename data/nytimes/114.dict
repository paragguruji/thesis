Fairstein, who retired as chief of the special victims unit.\n\n\u201cI worked with a lot of great lawyers in public service,\u201d Ms. Fairstein said in an interview. \u201cThere is a fairness about her to the core that is just extraordinary.\u201d\n\nIn 1989, Judge Donnelly was assigned to the Major Offense Career Criminal Program, a specialized bureau that focused on repeat offenders and violent felons, according to the office of Senator Chuck Schumer, who recommended her for the federal court. She served in a number of management positions, including as chief of the Family Violence and Child Abuse Bureau and as senior trial counsel.\n\nPhoto\n\nAndrew M. Lankler, a partner at Baker Botts LLP, who served in the office from 1990 to 1996, said, \u201cShe\u2019s an extremely intelligent, deliberative and conscientious person uniquely unswayed by anything other than justice.\u201d\n\nDaniel J. Horwitz, a partner at McLaughlin & Stern LLP, who worked in the district attorney\u2019s office from 1991 to 2000, described her in a message as \u201ctenacious, exceedingly bright but eminently fair with an even temperament.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cShe\u2019s exactly the type of judge you want to appear in front of.\u201d\n\nMs. Fairstein noted that Judge Donnelly was steadfast in the face of high-profile cases that gained widespread attention. She was a lead in the prosecution of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Tyco chief executive who was convicted in 2005 for looting nearly $100 million from the company, for which he served six and a half years in prison.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Vance Jr., now the Manhattan district attorney, who worked as an assistant in the office with Ms. Donnelly, cited the breadth of her experience.\n\n\u201cAnne has tried every kind of case as a judge and a prosecutor, is a truly experienced and tough trial lawyer, and still remains one of the most genuinely good and nice people I know,\u201d Mr. Vance said in a text message early Sunday. \u201cThe federal bench is lucky to have her and I miss her as a state court judge in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nJudge Donnelly, who was born in Royal Oak, Mich., received her law degree from the Ohio State University College of Law in 1984.", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": "Christopher Mele", "type": "article"}
