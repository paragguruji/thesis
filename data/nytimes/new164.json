But foreign policy is a realm of cruel choices, and it is not clear that the suffering caused by a narrower gate for refugees is obviously worse than the suffering caused by drone strikes and bombing runs and \u201ckinetic military actions,\u201d all policies that consistently command bipartisan support.\n\nSo why the weekend frenzy, the screaming headlines, the surge of protest? Because of several features inherent to populism, which tend to undermine its attempts to govern no matter the on-paper popularity of its ideas.\n\nFirst, populism finds its voice by pushing against the boundaries of acceptable opinion. But in the process it often embraces bigotries and extremisms that in turn color the reception of its policies.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s original \u201cMuslim ban\u201d forays (and the clash-of-civilizations rhetoric of his inner circle) that has shaped how his freeze has been received. His defenders may protest that most Islamic-majority countries are not affected, that any counterterrorism policy will disproportionately affect Muslims, and that the White House order draws on a list of countries that President Obama targeted for (much more modest) visa restrictions. All of this is true, but still \u2026 Donald Trump ran for president calling for a temporary ban on Muslims. Once he crossed that line (and many others), it became inevitable that any move like this would be seen as a second-best path to religious discrimination, and resisted fiercely and understandably on those grounds.\n\nSecond, having campaigned against elites and experts and all their pomps and works, populists imagine that their zeal can carry all before it, that proceduralism and institutional knowledge are for losers and toadies and men with soft hands, and that a few guys in the White House can execute a major overhaul of a delicate system without bureaucratic patience or rhetorical finesse.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

That makes it hard for populists to course correct, because they get stuck in a \u201cthe worse the better\u201d loop, reassuring themselves that they\u2019re making progress when actually they\u2019re cratering.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the divide, the ascent of populism also creates an unusual level of solidarity among elites, who feel moved to resist on a scale that they wouldn\u2019t if similar policies were pursued by normal political actors. Thus Trump, not even two weeks into his presidency, has already faced unusual pushback from the intelligence community, the Justice Department, the State Department and other regions of the bureaucracy, even as the media-entertainment complex unites against him on a scale unseen even in previous Republican administrations, and the Democratic Party is pressured into scorched-earth opposition before policy negotiations are even joined. These tensions ratcheted up over the weekend; it\u2019s difficult to see how they ratchet down.\n\nThe great fear among Trump-fearers is that he will deal with this elite opposition by effectively crushing it \u2014 purging the deep state, taming the media, remaking the judiciary as his pawn, and routing or co-opting the Democrats. This is the scenario where a surging populism, its progress balked through normal channels, turns authoritarian and dictatorial, ending in the sort of American Putinism that David Frum describes darkly in the latest issue of The Atlantic.\n\nBut nothing about Trumpian populism to date suggests that it has either the political skill or the popularity required to grind its opposition down. In which case, instead of Putin, the more relevant case study might be former President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood leader whose brief tenure was defined both by chronic self-sabotage and by the active resistance of the Egyptian bureaucracy and intelligentsia, which rendered governance effectively impossible.\n\nThe Egyptian deep state\u2019s sabotage of Morsi culminated in a coup. This is not my prediction for the Trump era. But what we\u2019ve watched unfold with refugee policy suggests that chaos and incompetence are much more likely to define this administration than any kind of ruthless strength.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "publish_date": "2017-02-01", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["case", "weekend", "trump", "political", "ban", "populism", "sign", "opposition", "president", "policy", "stumbles"], "summary": "Because of several features inherent to populism, which tend to undermine its attempts to govern no matter the on-paper popularity of its ideas.\nFirst, populism finds its voice by pushing against the boundaries of acceptable opinion.\nBut in the process it often embraces bigotries and extremisms that in turn color the reception of its policies.\nAll of this is true, but still \u2026 Donald Trump ran for president calling for a temporary ban on Muslims.\nBut nothing about Trumpian populism to date suggests that it has either the political skill or the popularity required to grind its opposition down."}
