The president made those comments despite years of wrenching debate over a string of cases of police shootings of unarmed black men.\n\n\u201cWhen the president says, \u2018Make sure to hit the heads of people on the door of the police car,\u2019 or pardons a sheriff accused of racial profiling, it redefines the law as just brute force,\u201d Mr. Waldman said.\n\nOfficials in the executive branch and in individual agencies have started to speak out with increasing, and surprising, frequency. A senior Justice Department official wrote a memo after Mr. Trump\u2019s Long Island speech, stating strongly that the agency does not condone brutality. So did several police departments across the country.\n\nMr. Trump, who spent his early adult years in the crime-ravaged, racially volatile crucible of New York City in the 1970s and 1980s, sees life through the prism of strength versus weakness. On Twitter, as Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas, Mr. Trump said he had unleashed the force of federal aid. On Sunday morning, as the rains continued, the president tweeted an endorsement of a book by another hard-line law enforcement official accused of civil rights violations: Sheriff David A. Clarke of Milwaukee County, Wis., whom he called \u201ca great guy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has spoken often of the significance of the rule of law, his actions have raised questions about his commitment to hallmarks of the American system like due process, equal protection under the law, independence of judicial proceedings from political considerations, and respect for orders from the courts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a champion of it; all you need to do is comply with it,\u201d said Charles Fried, a Harvard Law School professor who was a solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cAnd he shows himself absolutely unwilling to respect it,\u201d Mr. Fried said, citing the pardon as a particular thumb in the eye of a judge. \u201cIt\u2019s a use of authority specifically to undermine the only weapon that a judge has in this kind of ultimate confrontation.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to address the criticisms on the record, but one official said the president\u2019s actions on immigration enforcement, in particular, had re-established the rule of law instead of ignoring it, lifted the morale of the police, and restored the focus on combating illegal immigration to states instead of the federal government.\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump enthusiastically endorsed a brutal interrogation technique declared illegal under international law. \u201cTorture works,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a South Carolina event in early 2016, a statement he tried to modify when some of his outside advisers threatened to leave his campaign.\n\nWhen protests erupted at his rallies, he repeatedly waxed nostalgic about the \u201cgood old days\u201d when people could take such matters into their own hands. He endorsed stop-and-frisk policing, and said immigration by Muslims should be banned to protect Americans\u2019 safety. He argued to Bill O\u2019Reilly, then a Fox News host, that immigrants in the country illegally may not be entitled to due process at all.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A \u201cso-called judge,\u201d he called him.\n\n\u201cThose were rhetorical excesses. This is a use of power to disarm and make empty the actions of a judge,\u201d Mr. Fried said. \u201cYou come with a certain level of constitutional literacy, and he is totally illiterate in these domains. You think every day it can\u2019t get worse, and then it does.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore recently, Mr. Trump described himself as \u201cliberating\u201d towns from the scourge of gangs of undocumented immigrants. He has expressed anger with the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest supporters, for agreeing to take the job when he knew he might recuse himself from inquiries related to possible collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. And he asked Mr. Sessions in the spring if the federal charges could be dropped against Mr. Arpaio, and was promptly told no.\n\n\u201cYou get the sense that this is kind of New York wheeler-dealer territory, where you say whatever pops in your mouth to get through the negotiation,\u201d Mr. Waldman said.\n\nRobert Bauer, who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say that he stands for law and order \u2014 in fact, in many respects he\u2019s kind of the president of disorder. He\u2019s lurching around and basically responding to what he sees as his personal or legal imperative at any given moment.\u201d\n\nThe historian Douglas Brinkley recalled dining with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in late 2016, after the election, and hearing the president-elect describe dining privately with Richard M. Nixon in New York after his presidency had ended.\n\n\u201cIn his mind, a tough president was Nixon,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cHe creates a kind of fantasy world, and so he wants to be seen as one of the tough guys.\u201d\n\nThe pardon, the conservative Washington Examiner said in an editorial, showed \u201conce again Trump really means \u2018busting heads\u2019 when he says \u2018law and order.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe editorial added: \u201cBut \u2018law and order,\u2019 if the words have any meaning, has to apply to government actors as well. Lawless sheriffs promote disorder, and that\u2019s what Arpaio did to get himself convicted.\u201d\n\nMr. Arpaio said in an interview on Sunday that Mr. Trump\u2019s experience with the judiciary as it ruled against his travel ban targeting Muslim nations had led him to be suspicious of the motives of some judges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe understands that some courts are biased,\u201d Mr. Arpaio said. \u201cI can confirm that with my situation, believe me.\u201d\n\nMr. Arpaio said his pardon merely showed Mr. Trump\u2019s faith in the prerogatives of police officers. \u201cHe\u2019s not using me to show he\u2019s tough,\u201d Mr. Arpaio said. \u201cHe is enforcing the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really believe in his heart that he likes what I did and he believes I got the raw deal,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, on Fox News, the secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, was asked whether the president spoke for American values. Mr. Tillerson demurred.\n\n\u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman"], "publish_date": "2017-08-27", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["leaves", "mr", "waldman", "trump", "brand", "pardon", "judge", "leeway", "trumps", "york", "order", "president", "arpaio", "law"], "summary": "A senior Justice Department official wrote a memo after Mr. Trump\u2019s Long Island speech, stating strongly that the agency does not condone brutality.\nOn Twitter, as Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas, Mr. Trump said he had unleashed the force of federal aid.\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump enthusiastically endorsed a brutal interrogation technique declared illegal under international law.\nThis is a use of power to disarm and make empty the actions of a judge,\u201d Mr. Fried said.\nSessions in the spring if the federal charges could be dropped against Mr. Arpaio, and was promptly told no."}
