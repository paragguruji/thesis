When illiberal secularists in the West interfere regarding the outfits of conservative Muslim women \u2014 with bans on the burqa, the \u201cburkini\u201d or even just the head scarf \u2014 the defense is found within liberalism: Women have the right to \u201cdress as they please.\u201d This, of course, is a perfectly legitimate argument in a free society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

In Saudi Arabia and Iran women are forced by law to cover their heads. In fact, in some ways Saudi Arabia is a mirror image of the culturally hegemonic dystopia that Mr. Wilders dreams of: a land where the scriptures and shrines of a foreign religion are banned \u2014 not the Quran and mosques, in this case, but the Bible and churches.\n\nThis is not to say that Muslims who ask for freedom in the West must be held accountable for the lack of freedom in \u201cIslamic\u201d states. But it does mean that Muslim opinion leaders \u2014 imams, scholars, intellectuals \u2014 should give serious thought to a key question: Is liberalism a good or bad thing for Muslims? Should they embrace freedom or not?\n\nOften Muslims support liberalism when it serves them and reject it when it does not. They use the religious freedom in the West, for example, to seek converts to Islam, while condemning converts from Islam to another religion as \u201capostates\u201d who deserve death. Or ask for the right to freely organize political rallies in Europe, while you are crushing opposition rallies at home \u2014 as the Turkish government recently did during its spat with the Netherlands.\n\nSuch double standards can be found in every society. Mr. Wilders himself, who cheers for \u201cfreedom\u201d while aiming to ban the Quran, is a striking example. But some contemporary Muslims do it too easily, switching at will between \u201cour rules\u201d and \u201ctheir rules.\u201d The prominent Turkish theologian Ali Bardakoglu, the former head of the Religious Directorate, wrote about this \u201cdouble morality\u201d in a recent book and called on fellow Muslims to be more self-critical about it. Muslims should not be, he argued, \u201cpeople who can surf between different value systems.\u201d\n\nThe deeper problem is that Islam, as a legal and moral tradition, developed at a time when the world was a very different place. There was a very limited concept of individual freedom, as people lived in strictly defined communities. There were no notions of international law, universal human rights, the secular state or freedom of religion. Moreover, Muslims were often the dominant faith, making the rules to their advantage \u2014 such as tolerating non-Muslims as \u201cprotected\u201d but inferior communities.\n\nThat premodern world is long gone. There is now an increasingly diverse world where boundaries fade, cultures meet and individuals roam. And the forces that try to reverse this trend \u2014 liberal globalization \u2014 are often the very forces that despise Islam and threaten Muslims.\n\nMuslim opinion leaders have to decide where they stand. Do we Muslims want a free world with universal principles in which everyone, including us, lives according to their own values? Or do we prefer a segregated world where whoever grabs power imposes their values? And, if we choose the latter, what is going to protect us from all the Geert Wilderses of the world? In fact, what makes us any different?", "publish_date": "2017-03-27", "authors": "Mustafa Akyol", "type": "article"}
