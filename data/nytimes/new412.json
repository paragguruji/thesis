We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter in January, returning to a campaign-trail refrain that had captured Chaldean hearts and ballots across this stretch of Macomb and Oakland Counties. As the Chaldeans like to say, once with pride, now with fury, the area helped tip Michigan to Mr. Trump in November.\n\nSoon after the June 11 immigration raids, a local Chaldean noted the disconnect between tweet and deed. \u201cThen why are you deporting them?\u201d he wrote on Twitter, bracketing the question with a snarl of English, Aramaic and Arabic that would be unprintable in any language.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Arabic-language news channels and social media regularly bring word of ancestral villages razed, Christian cemeteries shattered and Chaldean churches shuttered. Though their villages were recently liberated, most Christians have stayed away out of fear, taking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nChaldeans, who practice Eastern Rite Catholicism, descend from the ancient Assyrians of what is now northern Iraq, where they are increasingly rare. Since 2007, nearly 30,000 Chaldeans have poured into the Detroit area, following waves of Iraqi Christian arrivals that began early in the last century and intensified after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. The number of Christians in Iraq has tumbled from about 1.4 million in 1987 to an estimated 250,000 last year, leaders of the community in the Detroit area said.\n\nMany of the Michigan Chaldeans speak little or no Arabic. Tattoos of the Virgin Mary and crosses stipple their shoulders and wrists.\n\n\u201cThe second they step foot out of the airport,\u201d after deportation to Iraq, \u201cthey\u2019re targets,\u201d said Wisam Naoum, a lawyer turned community activist.\n\nPhoto\n\nChaldeans had written off the Obama administration because of what they saw as its failure to accept more Iraqi Christian refugees. But Mr. Trump\u2019s original travel ban, issued in January, offered an implicit exception for Christians in the Middle East, allowing persecuted religious minorities to enter as refugees even as it barred people from Muslim-majority countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(When Mr. Trump revised the travel ban, he dropped the exception in an attempt to neutralize lawsuits claiming that the ban discriminated against Muslims. The Supreme Court agreed last week to hear the case.)\n\nIt took only a day of arrests for Detroit\u2019s Chaldeans to lurch from security to panic.\n\n\u201cWe anticipated they\u2019d be picking up the worst of the worst,\u201d said Martin Manna, the president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, a social services organization, where even citizens and green card holders are calling to ask if they should worry. \u201cNot people like Sam Hamama.\u201d\n\nUsama Hamama, 54, a partner in a local supermarket who goes by Sam, was getting ready for church with his wife and four children when immigration agents knocked on the door of his spacious home in a quiet West Bloomfield subdivision. He had just enough time to collect his medications and say goodbye before being taken into custody.\n\nMr. Hamama, who arrived in the United States from Baghdad when he was 11, was convicted of a weapons possession charge after he flashed an unloaded gun during a road-rage confrontation with another driver in 1988. He was ordered deported in 1994.\n\nHis children view him differently. \u201cI would never use the word \u2018felon\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018alien\u2019 for my dad,\u201d said Britanny Hamama, 20, his eldest child.\n\nLike many other Chaldeans, his wife was drawn to Mr. Trump by his opposition to abortion, his economic message and his promises of succor for Christians in the Middle East. But she could not bring herself to vote after Mr. Hamama warned her that their family could be snarled in Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother detainee, Najah Konja, was checking his emails over a cup of coffee on his back porch, looking out over the pond out back, when the doorbell sounded on June 11.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Konja, who goes by Nick, fled Iraq with his family at age 15, and later served 22 years in federal prison for selling cocaine. His green card was revoked, but since he could not be deported, he was able to stay, rise up the ranks at a chain of tobacco stores called Wild Bill\u2019s, become engaged and buy a house.\n\nUnlike some other ex-felons, he said, he had bettered himself and contributed to the local economy. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but I\u2019m more American than them,\u201d said Mr. Konja, 55, speaking by phone from a jail in Port Huron, Mich.\n\nStill, Mr. Konja and his family do not blame Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot of this stuff, it probably doesn\u2019t even get to his desk,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other families, the separation from fathers and husbands has forced them into a rueful reckoning: The immigration crackdown they had always associated with other people had, somehow, leapt from the southern border to their subdivisions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a Mexican and a Chaldean?\u201d said Nicole Sabatine, whose husband, Atheer Fawzi Ali, 41, was detained in June. \u201cWhen people, Mexicans, whatever, have kids here, taking their parent away is not the answer.\u201d\n\nMr. Ali\u2019s family fled Iraq in the early 1990s after his father, an army officer, defied an order from Saddam Hussein. He lost his green card after breaking into a car as a teenager.\n\nThat Sunday in June, he had just enough time to say goodbye to his 12-year-old daughter, Natalia, before turning himself in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you,\u201d he told her. \u201cEven if I\u2019m in Iraq.\u201d", "authors": ["Vivian Yee"], "publish_date": "2017-07-04", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["travel", "trump", "immigration", "dragnet", "iraq", "chaldean", "fall", "chaldeans", "christians", "fled", "hamama", "mr", "backing", "continue"], "summary": "We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter in January, returning to a campaign-trail refrain that had captured Chaldean hearts and ballots across this stretch of Macomb and Oakland Counties.\nAs the Chaldeans like to say, once with pride, now with fury, the area helped tip Michigan to Mr. Trump in November.\nLike many other Chaldeans, his wife was drawn to Mr. Trump by his opposition to abortion, his economic message and his promises of succor for Christians in the Middle East.\nBut she could not bring herself to vote after Mr. Hamama warned her that their family could be snarled in Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\nStill, Mr. Konja and his family do not blame Mr. Trump."}
