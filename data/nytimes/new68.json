A poll published on Sunday estimated that the Party for Freedom would come in first place, with 33 seats in the 150-seat Parliament, ahead of Mr. Rutte\u2019s party, which was projected to win 24 seats.\n\nThe letter from Mr. Rutte, which was published online on Sunday, seemed like an effort to head off that challenge by embracing some of Mr. Wilders\u2019s populist messages.\n\n\u201cIf you reject our country so fundamentally, I\u2019d prefer you leave,\u201d Mr. Rutte wrote in the letter. \u201cI have the same feeling. Act normal or leave.\u201d\n\nThe letter stunned members of the Dutch establishment.\n\n\u201cJust not normal,\u201d the newspaper NRC Handelsblad said in an editorial, turning Mr. Rutte\u2019s words against him. It condemned the remarks as simplistic and opportunistic, and warned that they risked scapegoating Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was you who caused the loss of our freedom, our security and our culture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wilders, who supports shutting down mosques and closing the borders to asylum seekers, wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe man of open borders, asylum tsunami, mass immigration, Islamization, lies and deceit.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Rutte\u2019s statement was not only a response to the polls, but also part of a broader strategy to reconnect with angry and disaffected voters who have been fleeing mainstream parties. While traditional center-left and social-democratic voters seem to be most open to the messages of the far right, center-right parties like Mr. Rutte\u2019s are taking heed.\n\nIn France and Germany, which are both holding national elections this year, center-right leaders have tacked right. Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a former prime minister who will be the center-right\u2019s standard-bearer in the French election, has promised a strict stance on Islam and immigration. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, while steadfastly defending her government\u2019s decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, recently took a hard line on the full-face veil worn by some Muslim women.\n\nThe debate over Islam in political life has a particularly strong resonance in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2002, Pim Fortuyn, an openly gay politician who was typically described as a right-wing populist despite resisting such categorization, was assassinated by a Dutch citizen angered by Mr. Fortuyn\u2019s anti-immigrant message.\n\nLater, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born activist who served in the Dutch Parliament, attracted global attention for her characterization of Islam as oppressive and violent. Ms. Hirsi Ali, who has renounced her Muslim faith, subsequently resigned from the Parliament during a controversy about her citizenship and moved to the United States, where she runs a foundation dedicated to protecting women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to the liberal party that they need to regain some of the votes that they virtually lost to the P.V.V., and part of their strategy is to be tough on immigration,\u201d said Claes de Vreese, a political analyst at the University of Amsterdam, using the Dutch initials for Mr. Wilders\u2019s party and the word liberal in the classical European sense of the word \u2014 supportive of free markets and individual liberties.\n\nIn previous years, the most important issue in the election would have been the economy, Mr. de Vreese said, but since the economy has been doing well over the past six months, the nation is more focused on immigration and integration, as well as on health care.", "authors": ["Ceylan Yeginsu"], "publish_date": "2017-01-24", "source": "nytimes", "top_words": ["turn", "wilders", "party", "challenge", "hardright", "ruttes", "immigration", "face", "rutte", "freedom", "dutch", "voters", "takes", "leader", "trumplike", "mr", "letter"], "summary": "A poll published on Sunday estimated that the Party for Freedom would come in first place, with 33 seats in the 150-seat Parliament, ahead of Mr. Rutte\u2019s party, which was projected to win 24 seats.\nThe letter from Mr. Rutte, which was published online on Sunday, seemed like an effort to head off that challenge by embracing some of Mr. Wilders\u2019s populist messages.\n\u201cIf you reject our country so fundamentally, I\u2019d prefer you leave,\u201d Mr. Rutte wrote in the letter.\n\u201cJust not normal,\u201d the newspaper NRC Handelsblad said in an editorial, turning Mr. Rutte\u2019s words against him.\nMr. Wilders dismissed Mr. Rutte\u2019s letter as an act of deceit, declaring in a video posted online: \u201cStop deceiving your own people."}
