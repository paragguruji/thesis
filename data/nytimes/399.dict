So he was predictably quick to sound off in triumph after the Supreme Court announced on Monday morning that in October it would consider the legality of his revised travel ban and will allow the ban to take partial effect in the meantime. The justices\u2019 decision, he said, was \u201ca clear victory for our national security.\u201d\n\nIn reality, \u201cvictory\u201d for anyone in this case is far from clear.\n\nMr. Trump, who had called during the campaign for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\u201d issued his first travel ban in January, but it was quickly blocked by the courts.\n\nA revised version, issued in March, barred visitors from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days and suspended the refugee program for 120 days.

It\u2019s a good question, and one that will be litigated aggressively over the summer. The court provided general guidelines \u2014 say, a family member of someone living in the country, a student admitted to a university or a worker with an employment offer in hand.
