But they could significantly complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to deliver on his campaign promises in short order, and may transform an action carried out by the stroke of a pen into a legal struggle lasting months or even years.\n\nAs a political matter, the expected lawsuits from Massachusetts and Washington State could also be an important first test of Democratic state attorneys general as they seek to push back against the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, Democratic legal officers at the state level have increasingly cast themselves as a check on Mr. Trump.\n\nAs an inspiration for their tactics, Democrats have cited the yearslong legal assault against the Obama administration by Republican state attorneys general, who succeeded in delaying or unwinding critical White House actions in court over the last eight years.\n\nMore than a dozen state attorneys general, all Democrats, signed a letter over the weekend condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order. In addition to Washington State and Massachusetts, attorneys general in several other states are considering taking action against the executive order, but they have not yet announced specific plans for litigation.\n\nThe White House has defended the executive order as a national security precaution, and advisers to Mr. Trump have insisted that it does not represent a religious test because it screens people chiefly on the basis of geography rather than religion.\n\nGroups challenging the order have described it as a kind of backdoor religious test, and have cited Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on the campaign trail denouncing Muslim immigrants and vowing to block them wholesale from entering the United States.\n\nIn its lawsuit against the Trump administration, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called Mr. Trump\u2019s policy a \u201cMuslim Exclusion Order,\u201d extensively citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Islam during the presidential campaign and his pledge during the Republican primaries to shut off all Muslim immigration into the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit also quotes Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who advises Mr. Trump, saying in an interview over the weekend that Mr. Trump had solicited his assistance in reformulating his Muslim immigration ban to pass legal muster.\n\n\u201cDefendant Trump has often repeated his bigoted views on Islam and Muslims in a variety of contexts \u2014 in print, on television, and via official campaign statements,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThe Muslim Exclusion Order is the legal manifestation of those bigoted views.\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": "Alexander Burns", "type": "article"}
