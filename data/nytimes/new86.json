Johnson, a former American aid official in Iraq, fears that the executive order will bar military interpreters who have bled for America and to whom we have promised entry. He told me about one interpreter, nicknamed Homeboy, who ran through fire to rescue a wounded American soldier, and then was himself shot. Homeboy survived, barely, but lost his leg \u2014 and as he recovered, a grenade was thrown at his home by insurgents angry that he had helped Americans.\n\nAfter years of vetting, Homeboy was approved for a visa for interpreters who helped the United States. Does Trump really want to betray such people who risked more for America than Trump himself ever did?\n\nYet if fear and obliviousness have led us periodically to target refugees, there\u2019s also another thread that runs through American history. It\u2019s reflected in the welcome received by somebody I deeply admire: Wladyslaw Krzysztofowicz. And this is personal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Nicholas Kristof Newsletter Receive emails about each column and other occasional commentary.

His aunt was murdered in Auschwitz for similar spying, but he was freed with a bribe. When World War II was ending, he fled his home as it fell into the hands of the Soviets.\n\nAfter imprisonment in a Yugoslav concentration camp, he made it to Italy and then France, but he couldn\u2019t get a work permit, and he thought that neither he nor any children he might later have would ever be fully accepted in France.\n\nSo he dreamed of traveling to America, which he had heard would be open to all. He explored a fake marriage to an American woman to get a visa, but that fell through. Finally he met an American woman working in Paris who convinced her family back in Portland, Ore., to sponsor him, along with their church, the First Presbyterian Church of Portland.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Krzysztofowicz stood on the deck of the ship Marseille, approaching New York Harbor in 1952, a white-haired woman from Boston chatted with him and quoted the famous lines from the Statue of Liberty, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free \u2026.\u201d Krzysztofowicz spoke little English and didn\u2019t understand, so she wrote them down for him and handed him the paper, saying, \u201cKeep it as a souvenir, young man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen as she was walking away, she corrected herself: \u201cyoung American.\u201d\n\nKrzysztofowicz kept that scrap of paper and marveled that he \u2014 a refugee who had repeatedly faced death in the Old Country for not belonging \u2014 now somehow counted as an American even before he had set foot on American soil, even before he had learned English. It was an inclusiveness that dazzled him, that kindled a love for America that he passed on to his son.\n\nThat strand of hospitality represents the best of this country. The church sponsored Krzysztofowicz even though he wasn\u2019t a Presbyterian, even though he was Eastern European at a time when the Communist bloc posed an existential threat to America. He could have been a spy or a terrorist.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t. After arriving in Oregon, he decided that the name Krzysztofowicz was unworkable for Americans, so he shortened it to Kristof. He was my dad.\n\nRecently I returned to the First Presbyterian Church to thank the congregation for taking a risk and sponsoring my father, who died in 2010. And the church, I\u2019m delighted to say, is moving to support a refugee family this year.\n\nMr. President, please remember: This is a country built by refugees and immigrants, your ancestors and mine.
