A new chapter ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAll the nations of the world \u2014 friend or foe \u2014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\n\nBut what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\n\nFor too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.\n\nWe\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we\u2019ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\n\nThen, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\n\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\n\nCrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.\n\nAbove all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic \u2014 and it is a fantastic \u2014 new F-35 jet fighter, and we\u2019ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.\n\nWe have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.\n\nWe have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2014 and a lifetime ban ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and we\u2019re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe\u2019re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.]\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And I\u2019ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTo protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they don\u2019t do much.]\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAt the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBy finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe want all Americans to succeed, but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.\n\nWe must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAccording to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\n\nIt is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThose given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\n\n(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.\n\nTo fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True \u2014 but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and we\u2019ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\n\nSolving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRight now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt will be a big, big cut.\n\nAt the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers \u2014 have to do it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCurrently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.\n\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAt our meeting, I asked them, \u201cHow are you doing? How is business?\u201d They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further, \u201cHow are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey told me \u2014 without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they\u2019ve become used to it \u2014 that it\u2019s very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\n\nThey weren\u2019t even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It\u2019s been a long time since we had fair trade.\n\nThe first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that \u201cthe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d\n\nLincoln was right, and it\u2019s time we heeded his advice and his words.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken \u2014 advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt\u2019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.\n\nAccording to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security and to restore respect for our laws.\n\nIf we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnother Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.\n\nWith the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

[Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it\u2019s unsustainable and collapsing.\n\nOne third of the counties have only one insurer, and they\u2019re losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They\u2019re leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There\u2019s no choice left.\n\nRemember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAction is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHere are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.\n\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.\n\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOn this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\n\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMegan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.\n\nIf we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIn fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2014 and the souls \u2014 of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThese families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning \u2014 great learning center \u2014 with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master\u2019s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut to create this future, we must work with \u2014 not against \u2014 not against \u2014 the men and women of law enforcement.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it\u2019s \u2014 really, it\u2019s what it is, division. It\u2019s pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They\u2019re friends and neighbors, they\u2019re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.\n\nWe are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJoining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel\u2019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2014 Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2014 were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.\n\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFinally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war \u2014 if they must \u2014 they have to fight and they only have to win.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\n\nMy budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he\u2019s very happy, because I think he just broke a record.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.\n\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and a Cold War and defeated communism.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost \u2014 have to do that.\n\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFree nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.\n\nThe only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\n\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.\n\nOn our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial. At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThink of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u2014 schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u2014 are not too much to ask.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.\n\nWe all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\n\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.\n\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.", "type": "article", "title": "Trump\u2019s Speech to Congress: Video and Transcript"}
