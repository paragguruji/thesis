His administration has insisted it will prevail.\n\nThe people who sued the president this winter were Muslim, and they were Christian. They were professors and grocery clerks. They were parents, daughters and sons-in-law, and they were married but divided, or just planning the wedding. They were Americans, or trying to become ones.\n\nThe ban \u201cisn\u2019t really what this country\u2019s about,\u201d Mr. Iye, 66, said recently through an interpreter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have brought my family if I didn\u2019t love this country, if I didn\u2019t believe this country was the land of dreams.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

It also blocked the entry of all refugees worldwide. The revision in March, an attempt to satisfy the courts, removed Iraqis, green card holders and visa holders from the list.\n\nIf the plaintiffs in many landmark constitutional tests are meticulously chosen for their compelling personal stories \u2014 think Jim Obergefell of Obergefell v. Hodges, which established a national right to same-sex marriage \u2014 the first travel ban plaintiffs emerged out of frantic necessity, plucked from airports where they had been denied admission.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, along with state attorneys general in Hawaii, Washington and Minnesota, have mounted the most successful challenges to the executive orders. The rest came about more haphazardly: Teams of pro bono lawyers hurried to the airports and the courts, filing lawsuits to free some of the trapped passengers. Other plaintiffs contacted their own immigration lawyers in hopes of striking down the ban, anxious to reunite with relatives who had been barred; still others lent their names to lawsuits after local Muslim community groups and immigration lawyers who were preparing to file court papers asked them to come forward.\n\nThere was Allan Hakky, an Iraqi Kurd who found himself picking up the phone and volunteering to join a lawsuit after his mother-in-law had to abandon plans to visit a daughter with a premature baby in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very private person, so to actually have my name on a federal lawsuit, on something so polarizing and so in the headlines \u2014 if somebody told me this a year ago, I\u2019d probably laugh at them,\u201d said Mr. Hakky, a technology executive who has lived in the United States for 27 years. He said strangers had harassed his home with threatening calls ever since the lawsuit became public.\n\nBut he added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to wake up one day and find a bunch of military people outside my house taking me to a camp the way they did to the Japanese. It\u2019s one of those things that, if you don\u2019t fight it at the beginning, does it get worse?\u201d", "publish_date": "2017-03-29", "authors": "Vivian Yee", "type": "article"}
