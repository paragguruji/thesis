Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhen is the hearing, and how can I listen?\n\nThe court has scheduled an hour of arguments to start at 3 p.m. Pacific time. The arguments will take place by telephone, probably because the judges and lawyers are scattered around the country. The court will stream the audio live on its website.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking an emergency stay of a trial judge\u2019s ruling that blocks Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. The order suspended travel from seven mostly Muslim countries and limited the nation\u2019s refugee program.

Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter and is based in Phoenix; Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama and is based in San Francisco; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush and is based in Honolulu.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
